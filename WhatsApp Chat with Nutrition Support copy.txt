Just had biryani and seekh kababs. I weighed each of them seperately and oil is an estimate. Seems fair?

3 egg whites have 45 calories
and 3 whole eggs have 215 calories 

is that correct?
10/11/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair joined from the community
10/11/2024, 6:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Basically an egg has 70 calories. 

Egg white is 17 calories

10/11/2024, 9:38 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I understand ratio of lean meat to fat can cause protein content to vary but if I'm unsure about the fat content in the ground beef that was cooked today, what is a safe assumption to put down for calories and protein per 100g of ground beef?
10/11/2024, 9:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: 80:20
10/11/2024, 9:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's how I'd do it. It could have less fat %, but if I'm on a weight loss quest, I overestimate calories when guestimating... makes it easier to stay in a deficit
10/11/2024, 9:50 pm - PF - Maria Ammar joined from the community
10/11/2024, 9:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Most standard beef is 80/20 so that’s the safest.
10/11/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Yup that's exactly why I wanted to know safe assumption 😉
10/11/2024, 9:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: We've got you!! 😉
10/11/2024, 9:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: We've done it so much that it's second nature to us
10/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: How would you log this in any app?
10/11/2024, 9:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: So I had qeema today as you will find out on fb shortly 😜

I record it as xxx g ground beef
10/11/2024, 9:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
1. That's what I'd search in MFP
2. and pick the 3rd option

EDIT: I am using MFP web (since I am always on my pc 😋)
10/11/2024, 9:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: And then oil estimate
10/11/2024, 9:59 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: <Media omitted>
These are the calories suggested by the app…should i eat less than these or these already calculated in a deficit?
10/11/2024, 10:01 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Or just go with this. This is easier 😁
10/11/2024, 10:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Have you calculated your macros using Sameet's macro/calorie calculator yet?
10/11/2024, 10:02 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Not yet
10/11/2024, 10:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then do that first and post it in the FB group. We'll verify it for you <This message was edited>
10/11/2024, 10:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then you can change it in your app
10/11/2024, 10:02 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Ok

10/11/2024, 10:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No thank you 😂
10/11/2024, 10:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha, challenge accepted! 👀 Hard to tell the portion size from this close-up (it had me sweating 😅), but it looks like around 5-7 tbsp of cooked sawaiyan with khoya, milk, oil, and sugar mixed in—so I’d estimate it to be roughly 270-320 calories

is this right? i searched for cooked daal. and 150gms looks v less and sad when i pull it out in a bowl lol
10/11/2024, 10:27 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: 400 - 450g of bell pepper
100 - 120 g qeema
20 g shredded mozzarella
10/11/2024, 10:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: 😰😰😰
what is this hahaha
10/11/2024, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not cooked. That’s 150g raw. Search for cooked lentils.
10/11/2024, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Which will be like 450-500 cooked
10/11/2024, 10:34 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
this okay?
10/11/2024, 10:34 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: it says 173 😅
10/11/2024, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I meant it’ll be 450-500g of cooked daal.
10/11/2024, 10:35 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 150g raw will be 450-500 g cooked
10/11/2024, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
10/11/2024, 10:35 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: oh. sorry xd

10/11/2024, 10:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Didn’t you track itv
10/11/2024, 11:07 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I loged ingredients  in my recipe  sec and 70 g turns to be 220 cal  u are too close ...I used one tbsp ghee for whole
10/11/2024, 11:07 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Bravo to ur calculations 🙌🙌
10/11/2024, 11:11 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Actually no 🙈
10/11/2024, 11:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha well! I was off by 50 cals
10/11/2024, 11:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Track like this. Looks decent. 

Cheese is probably a bit more though.

10/11/2024, 11:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d just estimate 1200ish calories for the meal
10/11/2024, 11:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A scoop of ice cream is 250ish calories. So 2 scoops with the Oreo and wafer is like 550 calories.
10/11/2024, 11:52 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Wow I feel so guilty now. How do I recover from this extra calorie intake for the day?

Is fasting a good option to equalize the calories for the week?
10/11/2024, 11:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Are you going to be eating this much this week?
10/11/2024, 11:53 pm - PF - Amna Mir: I really need to achieve my target goal by my birthday in January. It’s a promise to self that I can’t break.
10/11/2024, 11:53 pm - PF - Amna Mir: No. I plan on keeping it clean for the whole week.
10/11/2024, 11:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: What was your target calories and how much did you eat today?
10/11/2024, 11:54 pm - PF - Amna Mir: My target is 1590

And adding this lunch with my breakfast and diner today. I’ve roughly touched 2100 calories
10/11/2024, 11:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay great, this isn't a biggie. Let me make it make sense to you!
11/11/2024, 12:01 am - Taha Ahmed: First off, don't feel guilty at all! One day of overdoing it doesn’t completely derail your progress. Think of your goal as a long-term journey, not a race (get to goal weight by Jan). A small bump like this doesn't define your overall progress—consistency over time is what truly matters. 💪🏽 (YES! I am going to annoy everyone with my consistency is key quotes.)
 
As for those 510 extra calories, don’t stress. Your body won’t suddenly store all of it as fat just because you ate a little more than usual. It’s about the bigger picture: you're still on track, and there's plenty of time to hit your target.

You can easily adjust your calories over this week or the next as well. 
510 / 7 days = 72
Minus 72 from your daily intake, i.e. 1590.

You can have 1500 calories everyday this week and you'll be pretty much on track (that means in a caloric deficit and be on your way to lose weight)

How does it make you feel now?! <This message was edited>
11/11/2024, 12:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 🔥🔥🔥
11/11/2024, 12:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And use this as a learning opportunity. 

So for instance, next time if you don’t want to overindulge because you’ve got a goal then focus on servings. 

Instead of two scoops of ice cream, ask for one. 

Instead of 2 serving of chaat, take one. 

Another factor to consider is that you hadn’t eaten anything since breakfast and so were probably pretty hungry by dinner which makes it harder to make rationale choices.

11/11/2024, 12:21 am - PF - Amna Mir: Thank you so much!! I was literally going to get into my old cycle of starving after having eaten a big meal. But I ate my dinner because I had so much work and needed the energy. 

This break down of calories and you simplifying the math for me just made it so underwhelming and calm!! 

Uff I don’t even wanna sign out of this group even when I achieve my toned tummy and Lara Croft physique 😂 (which will be a while) 
Cause you make meal prep and Fitness so much fun.
11/11/2024, 12:21 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Like macros  main agar aik din fats zayada ho gaye to qayamat nahi ayegi ...aik din zayada kha liya to that can easily be adjusted all we have to focus  on our portion size in start by weighing  it.....plus workout is a good for fitness and mental health ....it is not a shortcut to lose weight but added benefit to that goal
11/11/2024, 12:23 am - PF - Amna Mir: That’s so true and I’ll definetly keep this in mind. 

Politeness ke chakkar mein I didn’t even say no, but that meant I said “no” to my personal goals.
11/11/2024, 12:24 am - PF - Amna Mir: Yes I’m working out now before sleeping so I can expend some of that energy consumed.
11/11/2024, 12:26 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha, that's why I go by "No BS Coach!" 🍷😁

11/11/2024, 1:30 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): To include in daily diet for protein  .I will reach home  daily by 2 and then will make bf for me  so will use these things in sandwich  ..
11/11/2024, 1:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it can be a good addition to your current food intake if the goal is to improve protein intake
11/11/2024, 1:36 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Any idea how many calories in 300g beef shami bun kabab for mirchili

What could be the calories/macros count.
11/11/2024, 2:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Estimated: ~240-280 calories
Protein: 5-7g
Carbs: 32-35g
Fat: 6-8g
11/11/2024, 2:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Just a question. I don't track my calories eating out. I only eat out once a week
11/11/2024, 2:43 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Do I really need to track
11/11/2024, 2:43 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Everyone shares their takeaway and restaurant food . Make me think if I need to
11/11/2024, 2:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: You don’t *have* to track every meal! Eating out can sometimes make it hard to stick to a calorie deficit, with some meals reaching over 1000-2000 calories. 

If you’re generally mindful of your intake and know you’re staying around or under your limit, it’s okay not to log it in the app. 

You could just take a picture of your food if you want to estimate later! (or not, your choice)
11/11/2024, 2:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's great for educational purposes. You learn about your eating habits especially when you're eating out
11/11/2024, 2:51 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Also, I am tracking everything on Macros...not sharing any pictures here...
11/11/2024, 2:51 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Sooo...should I sometime? Or go by Macros only ?

Then can i consider this Fat entry for my oil used to cook? Or should i enter a separate entry for oil ?
11/11/2024, 2:53 pm - PF - Amna Awais: <Media omitted>
11/11/2024, 2:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think it'd be helpful to share it with us in the FB group every few days or once a week. Include screenshots or food pictures so we can double-check that the entries match what you're actually eating!
11/11/2024, 3:26 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So if it's been more than 3 weeks that I'm on 1400 calories and can't see results, should I move to 1300 calories?

How many grams was the potato patty? 
Add that. Maybe half an egg if you used that and then oil
11/11/2024, 3:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you post this in the Facebook group. We can give a detailed response there
11/11/2024, 3:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rice cooked 60g
Yoghurt 10g
Cooked lentil 25g

How many calories is this?
11/11/2024, 4:03 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: This is "karelia sabzi" btw
11/11/2024, 4:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, break it down like Sameet mentioned above and then track it in the app - a bit tedious, but its more accurate
11/11/2024, 4:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Probably ~350-380 calories (it looks like it has atleast 2-3tsp oil)
11/11/2024, 4:05 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Ermmmm...we can take 2
11/11/2024, 4:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: *One tip for fat loss:* when estimating portions, it's better to go with the higher range. This helps you stay within your calorie limit and encourages mindful choices. It’s not about restricting—just being informed and a bit cautious.
11/11/2024, 4:09 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Actually I measure everything....
11/11/2024, 4:09 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: My roti was 50 gms...
11/11/2024, 4:09 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Karelia is 40 gms
11/11/2024, 4:10 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Oil used in the entire cooking was 4 tbsp

11/11/2024, 4:10 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Actually I wanted to see, if all is going correct
11/11/2024, 4:11 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: But I agree with the approach of overestimating...that's why in the end i always jack up my calories by 200 over all
11/11/2024, 4:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Roti-50g
Karela-40g

About 190-220 calories (give or take depending on exact oil amount)
11/11/2024, 4:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: ~15-18 calories
11/11/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I will take it to 300...since there is a tsp of ghee on my roti

11/11/2024, 4:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just overestimate a tiny bit when estimating, not always (especially not when you're measuring everything)
11/11/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am always near to my calorie limit...like 1675 something for a target of 1700...
11/11/2024, 4:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could add the tsp of ghee and 2 tsp oil in this

How do I track 84 grams of chicken shami kabab (home made with chana  daal) ? (Tracked weight when it was frozen, not cooked)

Used 1tsp oil for cooking 
2 slices of bread + 1 whole 🥚 egg + 2 take away ketchup packets for seasoning sandwich 

200 milk, tea ,2tsp sugar
11/11/2024, 4:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Karela is bitter gourd so you might find that in the app

100gm bittergourd calories and macros
11/11/2024, 4:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Total: approx ~560 calories

Breakdown everything into single food item like this:

Chicken Shami Kabab (84g): 150 calories
1 tsp Oil (for cooking kabab): 40 calories
Bread (2 slices):140 calories (regular white)
Whole Egg (1): 70 calories
Ketchup maybe ~20 calories 
Milk (200ml): 100 calories (frehs milk)
Tea doesn't have many calories so don't track that
And sugar (2 tsp): 30 calories
11/11/2024, 4:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: MacroFirst and MFP might give you some other calories. I just estimated it in my head!
11/11/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Yes I was just concerned about the shami kabab calories, the rest I added into macros first. 

Thanks a lot ✨

11/11/2024, 4:39 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: Idk if it'll help, it's my kids fav dish, and i had no energy to cook separately for myself today
11/11/2024, 4:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s one piece chicken and a cube of potato?
11/11/2024, 4:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d recommend taking more protein btw.

11/11/2024, 5:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d track this as:

50g raw chicken breast

50g tomato

Bananas are so much dense in calories thing.
11/11/2024, 8:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Use grams. Your bananas might not be as big. 

Everything in grams to be more accurate.
11/11/2024, 8:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Very difficult to guess from a zoomed in picture but I’d say that’s about 
250g cooked rice
25g peas
4tsp oil
80g chicken thigh

Quick question: I am trying to track grilled chicken I had, I weighed it after cooking. On mfp should I opt for 200g raw skinless chicken breast or search an entry for cooked one.
11/11/2024, 11:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s actually very good tracking.
11/11/2024, 11:48 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Exactly. After peeling it the weight is almost reduced to half
11/11/2024, 11:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Garbanzo beans cooked 60g
Chicken cooked 70g
Oil 2tsp
11/11/2024, 11:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Milk whole
11/11/2024, 11:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many grams was it?
11/11/2024, 11:50 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: 200g after cooking
11/11/2024, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’ll be around 270g raw chicken breast then
11/11/2024, 11:55 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: So safe to just multiply cooked chicken weight by 1.35 every time right?
11/11/2024, 11:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup.
12/11/2024, 12:11 am - PF - Ahmed Rao: What would be the ratio for ground beef incase I had seekh kabab or any other dish like keema.
12/11/2024, 12:13 am - Taha Ahmed: That really depends on what goes in the making of it, but generally, I like to take 70:30

70% meat with fats
30% veggies, masalas, herbs, etc
12/11/2024, 12:13 am - Taha Ahmed: Ab agar kisi ne 50/50 kardiya tou kuch nahi kar saktay 🤭
12/11/2024, 12:13 am - Taha Ahmed: I hope that was the question! hahah
12/11/2024, 12:16 am - PF - Ahmed Rao: What I meant was that assuming there are no other significant ingredients such as the case in grilled chicken or maybe seekh kabab. Just talking about the ability of a food to loose water weight after beinh cooked (assuming that is the science here) what should be the ratio.

Like @60193244266 mentioned chicken is usually 1.35 times of cooked version.

12/11/2024, 12:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I had seekh kebab yesterday. And if the seekh kebab is 100g. I record it as 135g. 

Simple. Plain. No Fuss.
12/11/2024, 12:35 am - Taha Ahmed: For beef, I do things a bit differently. Since ground beef has a higher fat content, the water loss ratio can vary more than with chicken. Typically, cooked ground beef weighs about 75-80% of the raw weight due to water and fat content loss.

So, I’d track 100g of cooked ground beef as 125g raw using a multiplier of 1.25x.
12/11/2024, 12:35 am - Taha Ahmed: It's a good estimate when tracking, especially if you’re having it plain, like in grilled kebabs without fillers

Is the tracking ok? Measurement wise also? I usually add 2 k&N shami kababs and half paratha and less veggies.

12/11/2024, 1:11 am - Taha Ahmed: The FDA only requires companies to list calories when they’re significant, which means trace amounts of ingredients like oils might not be accounted for on the label. But even these small amounts add up, especially if you’re using them regularly. Remember, calories count—even when you don’t see them on the label or when you don't count them.

Edit: 0.25g may be traces, but added 4x, that's 1g of oil (9 calories). The more you add, the calories add up, just like any other oil <This message was edited>
12/11/2024, 1:12 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: How should i count it then? Lats say 1/4 sec spray

12/11/2024, 1:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Basically one way is to put the bottle on the scale. Spray it and then check how many grams has reduced. 

If it’s 0 then you don’t have to track. But if it’s 4-5g then you can track cause that’s almost 40-50 calories.

12/11/2024, 5:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Or a protein snack in between
12/11/2024, 5:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Was just about to suggest this
12/11/2024, 5:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Something with 15-20g protein
12/11/2024, 5:30 pm - PF - Izma Arshad: what could that be
12/11/2024, 5:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Chicken or protein granola with Greek yogurt
12/11/2024, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. That’s a go too for me. 

Even like a chicken cheese open faced sandwich. 

Or a wrap.
12/11/2024, 5:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Egg and cheese sandwich
12/11/2024, 5:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: A sandwich is a meal for me 🤦🏻‍♀️😜
12/11/2024, 5:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol
12/11/2024, 5:33 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: so pretty
12/11/2024, 5:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ok I will try to incorporate it. No wonder when I make my husband. Sandwich he goes to me where is the main food

12/11/2024, 6:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'm coming to KL again soon, I'll make you some. Haha! 😂
12/11/2024, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You did not make that. Did you?
12/11/2024, 6:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse not! 😂
But I know how to make it exactly like that... probably better! 🤷🏽‍♂😈

This entry is right for cooked beef qeema?
12/11/2024, 6:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent. You’ll need to add oil seperately.
12/11/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Yes alright
12/11/2024, 6:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: You made it ?
12/11/2024, 6:50 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is beef fried ?
12/11/2024, 7:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, I didn't make it!

And yes, it's deep fried to get that crispy texture (corn flour coating)
12/11/2024, 7:09 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 100g cooked chappati and one naan has same cals?
12/11/2024, 7:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pretty much.
12/11/2024, 7:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g chapati is massive. 

Meray ghar ki is like 35g hahaha
12/11/2024, 7:24 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Mery ghar ki to like normal size hi hoti hy but weighs 70-90
12/11/2024, 7:25 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
This is for everyone and total oil used is 30 ml will have 100g how much oil 5 ml?
12/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do you know today weight?
12/11/2024, 7:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or how many people will have it in total
12/11/2024, 7:29 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 5-6 but everyone portions will be different.
12/11/2024, 7:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use 8ml to be safe
12/11/2024, 7:30 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Okay
12/11/2024, 7:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
@923343773307  this one is for you. Please guess how many calories. This is anda paratha with two eggs
12/11/2024, 7:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: For this portion (half a paratha and anda) or for the whole thing (full paratha and two eggs) - it looks like its half a portion
12/11/2024, 7:39 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I guess there should be a rule to share restaurant name too
12/11/2024, 7:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think it’s a full portion just folded in a way that looks like half. 

I’d personally go with 600 since these restaurants use more oil than usual for that extra crisp <This message was edited>
12/11/2024, 7:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, that's right.

A deep-fried paratha with two eggs can add up to around 520-580 calories due to the extra oil absorbed during frying. 
If it's a paratha that's cooked with less oil (1-2 tsp) would bring the total to around 400-460 calories.
🤷‍♂️

12/11/2024, 8:39 pm - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): Also I have a question. @60193244266 How can we calculate calorie of Palak Gosht ? 🙃
12/11/2024, 8:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Gosht and oil mostly
12/11/2024, 8:43 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: What Sameet said. It's the whole thing just cut in half and placed on top of one another
12/11/2024, 8:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @60193244266 @923343773307 OK so this business is owned by a friend of mine so I asked him about all the ingredients.

Paratha - 280 cals 😳 (even though it's small size)
2 eggs - 140 cals
7 ml oil - 60 cals (just for eggs none for the paratha, they make it in a bread maker oven)

So 480 - you were spot on I'd say 🙌🏼. I'm impressed.
12/11/2024, 8:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
This is what they use
12/11/2024, 8:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How did he account for the calories of the paratha?
12/11/2024, 8:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What sorcery is this
12/11/2024, 8:52 pm - PF - Ali Haider: How did they make paratha without any oil? 🤔
12/11/2024, 8:52 pm - PF - Izma Arshad: forgot to take a picture but had one naan and a little bit of karhai (v less gravy - 2 pieces of chicken) how do i count the calories for this <This message was edited>
12/11/2024, 8:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d still overestimate oil because they sure as hell aren’t measuring the oil they use.
12/11/2024, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Naan is 250. 
Hard to tell calories for karhai but just to be safe, use 80g raw chicken thigh and 2tsp oil
12/11/2024, 8:54 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: You are not wrong at all. I would have easily overestimated it myself
12/11/2024, 8:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: He says it's mentioned on the packaging. I believe it's one of those frozen parathas type that you get in the supermarket
12/11/2024, 8:57 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Noted I will adjust accordingly
12/11/2024, 8:57 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Btw since it's a food truck, I did stand inside once and watch them make it
12/11/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: The paratha went into this directly without any oil
12/11/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @60193244266 @923343773307 ...have you ever counted chickpeas flour( besan) as a tremendous source of protein...only a 100 gms give you 22 gms of protein
12/11/2024, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhhh okay
12/11/2024, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Only a 100g? 100g bohat hota hai.
12/11/2024, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Puray pizza ki base banjaye hahahaha
12/11/2024, 9:04 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Hahahahahah....
12/11/2024, 9:05 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Nahi itna nahi hota...
12/11/2024, 9:05 pm - PF - Ali Haider: It is a carb dominant source
12/11/2024, 9:05 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
Rough estimate per 100g
12/11/2024, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Kal meray pizza ki base was 90g flour
12/11/2024, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This isn’t right I think

12/11/2024, 9:07 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: This too
12/11/2024, 9:07 pm - PF - Ali Haider: 63g carbs in 100g is too much
12/11/2024, 9:10 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I don't think so... I mean if you can stay in your caloric limit...
12/11/2024, 9:12 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Yes, that makes sense.
12/11/2024, 9:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah close enough.
12/11/2024, 9:36 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Desi food question 🤗
I made pulao today 450g rice 1kg mutton  and added 1/4 cup oil for that 
But mutton was with fat and end product  was oily and greasy so how to calculate that fat 🤔...
Abhi main nay khaya nahi hai so just asking about estimation
12/11/2024, 9:36 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Whole Egg intake on a daily process will mess with cholestrol? Or should i just use egg whites?
12/11/2024, 9:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Mutton is high fat anyway so you add mutton, it’ll account for that
12/11/2024, 9:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Food cholesterol doesn’t really impact blood cholesterol
12/11/2024, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In fact some studies have shown that eating egg can improve cholesterol.
12/11/2024, 9:41 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Thank you

12/11/2024, 9:54 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My snack   ... Still not enough proteins. I had two lamb botis from Salan to get more
12/11/2024, 9:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks good. You’re barely using Greek yogurt hence low protein. Either add more Greek yoghurt or add whey or something like that
12/11/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Fat is going up and up
12/11/2024, 9:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do you get low fat Greek yogurt
12/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
12/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Looks like full fat
12/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Low fat tastes awful though
12/11/2024, 9:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Made it's to 65g . 14g protein now

12/11/2024, 11:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes
12/11/2024, 11:04 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: So I just checked and Greek style yogurt tends to have less protein per 100g as compared to Greek yogurt. I'd say have a look-see for Greek yogurt next time you are out shopping and you MIGHT end up with double protein content

12/11/2024, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: He’s right. Greek style isn’t that high. Greek yogurt is higher
12/11/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Which one is netter
12/11/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Better
12/11/2024, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: All of the are fine. Just different taste because of fat content.
12/11/2024, 11:07 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: These are very expensive. These are only 50g pots
12/11/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you don’t like low fat then go with 5% and see how you like it.
12/11/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There must be cheaper options too.
12/11/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fage is usually expensive
12/11/2024, 11:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's ok .
12/11/2024, 11:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will get it.
12/11/2024, 11:10 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Literally just found out after seeing the picture shared by @447723402200 😅
12/11/2024, 11:11 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Greek style tastes really good and creamy though
12/11/2024, 11:14 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Also I would like to share one point. One day I absentmindedly kept the Greek yogurt cup on the scale. Turns out the net weight 160 gms mentioned on the cup was inclusive of the packaging i.e. The cup itself. The yogurt content was 144 gms
12/11/2024, 11:15 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Yup. You can use drizzle of honey or cut up your favorite date into small pieces to sweeten the yogurt. Alternatively, if you want no extra calories, you can simply use sweetener.
12/11/2024, 11:20 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: That's greek "style" yogurt not the proper one
12/11/2024, 11:37 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
2 whole egg omlette 1 tbspn sunflower oil and chapati no oil approximately 100g looks ok ?
12/11/2024, 11:43 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: <Media omitted>
Coaches ...can you check that my entries are correct...
12/11/2024, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. Was the chapati 100g or was the flour 100g.
12/11/2024, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent. Just verify tender pops from the pack. Everything is good
12/11/2024, 11:46 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: The pera was 100g before cooking 🌚
12/11/2024, 11:46 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Let me check that...also I have crossed my caloric limit today....since my help deep fried my tender pops...kinda sad....
12/11/2024, 11:47 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: U should buy supermarket brands, tesco, sainsbury etc. They are more reasonably priced.
12/11/2024, 11:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then the roti must be lower.
12/11/2024, 11:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search chapati and add like 80g of it.
12/11/2024, 11:48 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: What % of my daily protein should i aim for if I can’t do 100%
12/11/2024, 11:49 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: For weight loss
12/11/2024, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What do you mean?
12/11/2024, 11:53 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
If i am not able to consume 115 protein. What should i aim for?
12/11/2024, 11:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d aim for a minimum of 90g if possible
12/11/2024, 11:59 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Okay 🙏🏽

Total Calories turn out to be 118. Makes sense?
13/11/2024, 1:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Haan decent hai
13/11/2024, 1:23 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Are we supposed to share daily tracking on fb?
13/11/2024, 1:45 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not necessarily
13/11/2024, 2:16 am - Taha Ahmed: Cholesterol in eggs have shown to improve HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and even lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol). LDL isn't directly linked to foods unless your overall nutrition intake is very poor.
13/11/2024, 2:23 am - Taha Ahmed: You're also eating quite fewer calories- that's under a 1000 calorie intake. 

If you're struggling to eat, add more high fat foods (nuts, creams, sauces, seeds, etc.)

PRO TIP: First eat the proteins, then high fat foods with carbs (as much as you can). It'll be easier for you to hit your proteins and consume more calories.
13/11/2024, 2:24 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: That’s just 2 meals. Still have dinner and maybe a snack
13/11/2024, 2:25 am - Taha Ahmed: That's right. I was mixing that up with your whole day's meals, only to realize you're not in Pakistan, and there's a time zone difference. 🙊
13/11/2024, 2:25 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: High ldl is genetic. Not sure right now if it’s the latter or perimenopause
13/11/2024, 2:28 am - Taha Ahmed: It can also be hormonal. I never had high LDL or overall cholesterol in my life, but ever since my surgeries and hormonal issues, I’ve been dealing with it too. Thankfully, it’s getting better with HRT, exercise, nutritious food, and lifestyle management.

LDL can be genetic, but with epigenetic changes, there’s a lot that can be improved. (your behaviors, environment, etc.) <This message was edited>
13/11/2024, 2:31 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I hope u’re well now  and hopefully no more surgeries in the future :)

13/11/2024, 5:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d estimate 5g

13/11/2024, 7:24 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): So cals?
13/11/2024, 7:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 220-250 calories generally in a scoop.
13/11/2024, 7:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Had i seen the serving I could have been more accurate
13/11/2024, 7:25 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Talking about icecream?
13/11/2024, 7:27 pm - PF - Sajida Ali: How do I know how much protein there is in 2 scrambled eggs?
13/11/2024, 7:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
13/11/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): This is choco kunafa cake
13/11/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): No icecream in it
13/11/2024, 7:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And that’s the best I can do for this cake. It’ll be similar calories I feel
13/11/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 eggs have 12g of protein. 

But will also depend on what else you’re adding to the eggs. 
Milk? Butter? Cream?
13/11/2024, 8:28 pm - PF - Sajida Ali: I cooked them in 1 teaspoon of ghee
13/11/2024, 8:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>

13/11/2024, 10:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For this also search club sandwich around 650 calories for 4 pieces. And then add 0.75 of it. 

Fries kay liye small McDonald’s fries
13/11/2024, 10:21 pm - PF - Amna Mir: This message was deleted
13/11/2024, 10:21 pm - PF - Amna Mir: He many ml does this serving look like?

13/11/2024, 11:42 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
this is 131g fried fish and 230g grilled
and 61g of salad with soy sauce. 

i weighed the bones separately at the end 25g but how do i record this? is 1tsp of soy sauce ok to add?
also how're we recording cooked roti?
14/11/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I am very confused on how to track my chapatti
14/11/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Should i track it as a perra/dough aur cooked?
14/11/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Didn't get time to measure. I was very busy.
14/11/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I don't use any oil
14/11/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I don't think I'm hitting enough protein in this meal
14/11/2024, 12:02 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Can you eye ball it
14/11/2024, 12:02 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Plz tell me
14/11/2024, 12:04 am - PF - Ali Hassan: They might be 😴
14/11/2024, 12:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You can do it either way 
measuring cooked is just easier
14/11/2024, 12:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just weigh the end result of the chapati. Cooked roti. 

50g is 120 calorie s
14/11/2024, 12:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
This is what I use
14/11/2024, 12:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s like 450g of raw fish (use trout)

And then 5-6tsp oil because it’s fried in a lot of oil
14/11/2024, 12:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cooked rice 120g
Mutton / Beef 70g
Oil 3tsp
14/11/2024, 12:13 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Which is more accurate?
14/11/2024, 12:14 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 👌🏽
14/11/2024, 12:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re both pretty much the same. 

Most accurate would be weighing the flour / atta before making the dough but that’s too much khuari. 

So this is a good estimate. 

Because I’ve tracked the flour a million times too and it’s always close to 50g chapati being around 100-120 calories
14/11/2024, 12:15 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you 🙏🏽
14/11/2024, 12:17 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: It was lamb chops
14/11/2024, 12:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then add lamb

14/11/2024, 12:56 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you made these kebabs without any oil ?
14/11/2024, 12:57 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ok I forgot to put oil entry . It was 1 tsp will do it just now.
14/11/2024, 12:58 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: 1343 calories altogether

14/11/2024, 1:17 am - PF - Ahmed Rao: Any idea what would estimate calories be in 170g kidney beans
14/11/2024, 1:18 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Around 15g protein approximate 200 calories boiled beans
14/11/2024, 1:18 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): First of all the good thing i have noticed is that your Protein intake has increased as compared to the avg. over last 7 days 
Secondly, what food sources for protein do you eat ?
14/11/2024, 1:19 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i have just joined so just some context to guide you in a better way
14/11/2024, 1:19 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I eat all kind of beans so I have a rough idea but check it later on app . Might be a difference . Depends how you cooked
14/11/2024, 1:19 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Hi Ali . Thanks for your help
14/11/2024, 1:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Chicken eggs yoghurt kefir  salmon or trout fish lamb

14/11/2024, 1:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Beans legumes vegetables
14/11/2024, 1:20 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 210-220 calories 
make the entry for the oil accordingly.
14/11/2024, 1:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Cottage cheese ,feta cheese mozzarella
14/11/2024, 1:22 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Okay. Can you show me the whole food diary ?

14/11/2024, 1:33 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you have just eaten 15g of chicken breast if you just increase it by 50g then your overall protein intake will increase by 14-15g taking your closer to your target. 
Or you can add low fat greek yogurt its a good protein source
14/11/2024, 1:33 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: The last meal I pushed myself to eat
14/11/2024, 1:34 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I wasn't hungry
14/11/2024, 1:34 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Only thing I can eat now is dark chocolate . But will skip it as I had sugar karak chai earlier
14/11/2024, 1:36 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You can have it 
you still have 250ish calories left for the day
14/11/2024, 1:39 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Also instead of making an entry for karak chai you can just add the quantity of milk  used to make it
14/11/2024, 1:39 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: It was from chaiiwala I didn't make it
14/11/2024, 1:43 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Okay

14/11/2024, 2:32 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: This entry include sugar. Which is more than I put. I ordered sugar free and put   it seperately. The one they serve is too sweet
14/11/2024, 2:36 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 2:36 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is this better

14/11/2024, 3:24 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is it ok to consume sugar while staying within my calorie budget? Or will it slow down the progress
14/11/2024, 3:36 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Is this myfitnesspal app ?
14/11/2024, 3:36 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Macros first

Chia, flex,basil seeds - do these have impact on diet/weight loss in anyway? As I bought these seeds as per my ex nutritionist’ recommendation: she said to take it in morning so it will make you full (* it never makes me full instead I’m more hungry 😅). Should I continue using it ? On and off - I think I saw Sameet’ reel on this chia seeds etc - it really doesn’t have that effect or beneficial for weight loss.
14/11/2024, 11:30 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): They do absolutely nothing for weightloss. I dont know ye myths kahan sy ae hain
Keeping weightloss aside, chia seeds basil seeds have fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, minerals

14/11/2024, 2:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For leg piece, search kfc leg but I think 240 is okay. 

Might be a bit lower
14/11/2024, 2:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: For Big Chains, you could easily go on their websites and find all the nutritional information from there.

For KFC, the website is: https://kfc.co.nz/nutrition

160 for drunstick
14/11/2024, 2:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Sounds about right
14/11/2024, 2:18 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And same for krunch?
14/11/2024, 2:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Krunch has lesser calories than a zinger 
420-450

14/11/2024, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Here's the answer: this honey crispy beef with sticky rice has got atleast 750-850 calories
14/11/2024, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Here's the reference picture^

Here's the breakdown:

Garlic Sticky Rice (1 cup):
~250-350 calories (white sticky rice with garlic and atleast 2tsp oil)

Honey Crispy Beef (200g):
~500-550 calories (includes fried beef, sauce made with honey/sugar, oil, cornflour, and sesame seeds) <This message was edited>
14/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: i remember you mentioned the beef was deep fried. for deep fried stuff, how much oil is added when tracking?
14/11/2024, 3:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Any crispy batter can really soak up oil when deep fried. A 200g portion of beef coated with cornflour could easily absorb around 20-30g of oil, which adds roughly 180-270 calories from the oil alone 

I've done this as an experiment too
14/11/2024, 3:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: I made three 100gm portions of marinated beef— and I baked, deep-fried, and sautéed it, weighing each one before and after. Factoring in water loss, I found that deep-fried beef often gains about 10-15% more weight, which is all due to oil absorption
14/11/2024, 3:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah it’s always going to absorb more oil. 

So if something is deep fried just add 26352728 tsp of oil. 🤣🤣🤣
14/11/2024, 3:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But realistically 4-5tsp is a safe bet
14/11/2024, 3:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thank you you guys let me "star" these messages 😁
14/11/2024, 4:09 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Was it filling ?
14/11/2024, 4:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: For me? Quite filling. I also had 6 dumplings, Thai green curry with more garlic sticky rice. Haha! 😂

For my friend, she could only eat half of hers and 2 dumplings. 

The portions are big!!
14/11/2024, 4:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: The chips I fry for kids sometimes . How much oil do they absorb. The frozen chips I think they already have oil in it
14/11/2024, 4:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: I shared this info just for general awareness—it doesn’t mean you need to stress over every drop of oil!
14/11/2024, 4:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They have some oil. 

But why do you want to know the oil absorption? 

It’s for the kids, they need the energy anyway so it’s fine.
14/11/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If I feel like eating too
14/11/2024, 4:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly^

For things like kids’ snacks, there’s no need to overthink it. The key is balance and consistency over time, not being perfect with every meal. Don't get caught up in the details, please!
14/11/2024, 4:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Eat it then!

Tikka boti with almost 1/2 tbsp oil and chilli sauce little bit
14/11/2024, 7:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: @447360154390 Tracking's good.

Here how I'd do it to increase protein:

3 eggs

Chapati/bread (I'd choose bread to have with fried eggs or scrambled), and make a paratha to have with omelet, or shakshuka style eggs)

Boiled potatoes 

Add some 20/30g granola in 120g Greek yogurt

That's ~32-35g protein
14/11/2024, 7:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Grilled or BBQ'ed?
14/11/2024, 7:46 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi: No. 
Cooked in fry pan -
14/11/2024, 7:46 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I was eating eggs for 2 days and my stomach didn't agree for the third day of eggs 😂

14/11/2024, 7:49 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I am going to make a post on this tonight

14/11/2024, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A chicken paratha roll from red apple or hot n spicy is usually around 450-500
14/11/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Maara hum.. Pekhawar main hay...🤣...and hot n spicy is lower in weight so is red apple... just your regular street food....acha thay wesay!
14/11/2024, 10:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha then can even be higher
14/11/2024, 10:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): meny ye khaya hua hai in peshawar 
70g paratha
110-120g chicken 
3tsp oil
20g k around sauces
14/11/2024, 10:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s close to 700-750
14/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes easy !!

15/11/2024, 12:25 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
15/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Pasta wheat. One of the most common wheat used especially for making pasta
15/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: You tend to see most of the everyday pasta have it mentioned on packaging
15/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I found the real entry

How to calculate this
15/11/2024, 12:51 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just add the amount of yogurt used
15/11/2024, 12:51 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes definitely !!
15/11/2024, 12:53 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s great.
15/11/2024, 12:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Press Tare. It’ll become zero. Then remove what you use and it’ll show you the left over amount. 

Let me make a video for this too
15/11/2024, 12:59 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I did but forgot about the plastic container 😂😂😂
15/11/2024, 1:00 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: How do i track 142 g of beef qeema (85 lean, 15 fat)?
15/11/2024, 1:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I put the plate and pressed tare then measured seekh kebabs and then forgot to remove the plate
15/11/2024, 1:00 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Cooked
15/11/2024, 1:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just press tare again. It’ll be zero with the seekh kebabs and then add dahi in the same plate. 

That way you track everything on one plate.
15/11/2024, 1:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah 80/20 is better. 

142g*1.35 =191.7 or 192g of raw beef.
15/11/2024, 1:06 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I know u said it before too but everything cooked i should x 1.35..all kinds of meat?
15/11/2024, 1:08 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Total oil i used for 436g of qeema was 2 tbsp so for 142g cooked 1 tsp is ok to track?
15/11/2024, 1:09 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: And i added 1/3 cup of dahi also while cooking is that to be tracked as well? How?
15/11/2024, 1:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
15/11/2024, 1:11 am - Taha Ahmed: 1/3 cup = 2.33 fluid ounce
1 fluid ounce = 29gm

so, 1/3 yogurt should be 70gm yogurt
15/11/2024, 1:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: As per the maths, you’ll need to add 2. 

2tbsp is 6tsps. So the entire thing had 6, your portion is around 1/3 of that so 2tsp
15/11/2024, 1:14 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Then this also i should calculate as 1/3: 23.3g?
15/11/2024, 1:17 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 22-23g of yogurt
15/11/2024, 1:18 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): which is like 14-15 calories
15/11/2024, 1:22 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
15/11/2024, 1:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Good hai.
15/11/2024, 1:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Garlic naan will be higher. I’d go with 300.
15/11/2024, 1:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Standard naan is 250 calories. Garlic naan has ghee or butter added.
15/11/2024, 1:37 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: This is what is showing me. That’s the brand i had
15/11/2024, 1:37 am - PF - Sajida Ali: Can someone tell me how to calculate calories for ghar pe bana hua pizza?
15/11/2024, 1:38 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
15/11/2024, 1:39 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just make enteries for all the ingredients used separately
15/11/2024, 1:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh it’s a branded one. Phir theek hai
15/11/2024, 1:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You don’t have to track the veggies. But cheese, dough, oil, and other such things

This was my breakfast after 16 hours of fasting. (Took the advice of @60193244266 of not restricting myself otherwise I’d go over board in eating what I always wanted to. So instead I saved my calories for my cravings) 
Kindly estimate its calories so I can have the second meal of the day accordingly.

220 is a fair estimate, it's probably got more! 💁🏽‍♂

15/11/2024, 7:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: You know you can go over your calories today and eat a bit fewer calories tomorrow, right?
15/11/2024, 7:43 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes I know but I'm so anxious . I know the maths
15/11/2024, 7:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Seems like you're eating out so don't worry too much about it. I don't think you do this everyday or every other day 

Social health is also important! Which is why guilt free eating and shifting that mindset is soooo important
15/11/2024, 7:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're hungry, eat your food. Have more nutritious, voluminous foods... Less calorie dense
15/11/2024, 7:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100-300 calories difference a day won't do much to your goals/results
15/11/2024, 7:46 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will do that . And yes I had food with my husband  without kids . So we spoke to each other uninterrupted. I needed that
15/11/2024, 7:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Itna serious nahi lena hota in cheezon ko 🙏🏽
15/11/2024, 7:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Lovely. Focus on that! 🙏🏽❤️
That's more important.
15/11/2024, 7:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Track the potato. The gosht. And oil.
15/11/2024, 7:47 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I have a friend who lost 6 kg in 3 months.... 😜

15/11/2024, 7:48 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
For these super oil daig wali biryani 200g rice oil estimation? And beef 100-120g
15/11/2024, 7:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: I went from 82 to 95kg in the last 6-7 months, phir ab kya karain? 😬😅

Stop comparing your progress to others 🌻
15/11/2024, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks like 250g rice. And then beef. And 4tsp oil
15/11/2024, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No scale to track actual measurements?
15/11/2024, 7:50 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): This is for reference i weighed my portion
15/11/2024, 7:50 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Beef was 120g but after removing the chiknai part it will ig 100g
15/11/2024, 7:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: One tip: TRACK YOUR BEFORE EATING if you don’t want a shock later and can then make informed decisions
15/11/2024, 7:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh phir theek hai
15/11/2024, 7:51 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): So total 4tsp oil?

This entry is okay?
15/11/2024, 7:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah

15/11/2024, 8:01 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Ok?
15/11/2024, 8:02 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And is this for cooked?
15/11/2024, 8:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good and it's raw
15/11/2024, 8:11 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 100g cooked will be how much row could not find any cooked entry
15/11/2024, 8:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g (cooked) x 1.35 = 135g (raw)
15/11/2024, 8:51 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: this is random but i felt like sharing it  😅 
i have two 'nutritionists' in my in-laws. i mean they do have a food and sciences degree. and I've heard *a looot* of crap from them over the years. 
we started doing this thing where we skipped roti and had salad instead for a few days (following one's plan) and i told her mujhe roti ki bhook lagti hai literally 😅 and i was told phir dopeher mein roti le lo and add a spoonful of desi ghee on it toh wo kuch nahi kahegi. 
it didnt last long (thankfully, im at fomo now)
yesterday they were thinking of starting their own thing selling meal plans 😅 and i had a good laugh inside. 
one of them went on a diet and she was boiling lemons and having that water all day. the other one was doing zeera water and enforced that on me. 
*no one* once said protein bhi zaruri hai. *no one*- it was just sauted veges with the same oily dinner. glad those days are over tho.
15/11/2024, 8:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: "dopeher mein roti le lo and add a spoonful of desi ghee on it toh wo kuch nahi kahegi." - this blew my mind 🤯
15/11/2024, 8:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: I used to believe that people with food and science degrees had all the answers, but over time, I’ve come to realize many of them don’t know much at all. Just full of HorseSHIT!!
15/11/2024, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve become so used to seeing this that nothing blows my mind anymore
15/11/2024, 8:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: 🌚 that's really my reaction haha!
15/11/2024, 8:57 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i sometimes wonder if the books which they get taught were written by zubaida aapa n alikes😄

15/11/2024, 9:09 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Is it okay if I eat above 1590 calories this weekend since it’s my friends wedding plus period week. 

And then fast the coming week cause I gotta makeup for missed Ramadan days anyways. 

Will it restore my progress for the month? 
I’m just craving high calorie burgers and pizzas 😭

15/11/2024, 9:15 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Cancer say to bach jayengay na
15/11/2024, 9:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse, it’s okay to go above your calorie target for special occasions like this. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and weddings are a time to celebrate! Enjoy the food and the experience without guilt. I MUST KEEP REPEATING THE SAME, AGAIN, n AGAIN!!

Fasting later sounds like a reasonable plan, but let’s keep a balanced approach. Fasting can sometimes lead to overcompensating later in the day or feeling low on energy, so it’s important to plan nutrient-dense meals during your eating window AND ALSO HIGH PROTEIN 👀. Also, keep your overall calorie intake for the week in mind from the start—it's important, especially if we want to avoid extreme ups and downs that can leave you feeling drained or frustrated.

Something as a reminder, again, that PROGRESS isn’t made or broken by one weekend or even one week! It’s the overall consistency over time that matters. While going above your calories for a couple of days might slow things down slightly in the short term, it won’t undo your hard work if you get back to your routine afterward.

And cravings are normal, so instead of trying to fight them completely, see if you can enjoy a burger or a slice of pizza mindfully. I was craving something sweet and now I am munching on a big ass snickers. Haha... 
Maybe have smaller portions or balance them out with lighter meals earlier or later in the day? The goal isn’t to restrict but to make room for the foods you love without going overboard.
15/11/2024, 9:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sorry for my essays! 😈
15/11/2024, 9:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Must be the energy from my snickersssss
15/11/2024, 9:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many pakoras were there? This world probably be 4-5 pakoras at best
15/11/2024, 9:16 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Good point.
15/11/2024, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search cooked lentils

Add 204g

Add 2tsp oil and then 14g butter.
15/11/2024, 9:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: HAHHAHAHAHAH!

I HAVE A DARK JOKE!
15/11/2024, 9:18 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Fire away
15/11/2024, 9:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha too dark...

But I probably should've had more coconut oil! It seems! 👀
15/11/2024, 9:19 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Ohh i am somewhat getting there 😬
15/11/2024, 9:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ye doctor baba pehlay kahan thay! hahahahaha!

15/11/2024, 9:35 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: @923343773307 
I'm wondering where do you get all that patience to write such long paragraphs... you must have typing training alongside nutritionist training 🥹
15/11/2024, 9:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ah, the secret is a mix of passion and practice! 😊
15/11/2024, 9:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: And also frustration with the nutrition world, and in general, with life.
15/11/2024, 9:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: When you love what you do, you find the energy to type out long messages. Nutrition training just gave me the knowledge; writing comes from wanting to support people like you! :)
15/11/2024, 9:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: To add to what Taha said, you can always take planned days that aren’t targeting weight loss. 

Example, I went to Pakistan and I made a conscious decision to not be in a deficit and try for maintenance instead for those 2 weeks. 

That means I could eat more calories, enjoy my trip and have fun. 

You can do the same thing since there’s a wedding going on. 

Also, balance is key. 

So for example, that domino’s lunch where you wanted pizza and you had it. Fantastic. 

But if calories are a concern then I’d either just have the pizza or maybe the pizza with wings (more protein too) and skip the cake. 

Or if you really want the cake then skip the wings. 

You can always have the other thing later or next time. 

It’s not going anywhere. 

You can have it tomorrow too. 

Once we come out of the restriction mindset then these choices become easier because you know you can have what you want, when you want.

Had to dine out today. Do I trust calories stated by the restaurant? Also my eyes aren’t trained enough how to figure out portion sizes of different ingredients so if you guys can help me out with this one. @60193244266 @923343773307
15/11/2024, 10:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
15/11/2024, 10:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What restaurant!?
15/11/2024, 10:47 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Evergreen Karachi
15/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They usually mess up their calories. Just add 2-3tsp of oil to what they mention and move on
15/11/2024, 10:53 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
Is this a good granola bar? As my fiber intake is low and I’m still struggling with completing my protein intake. So I can add this to my diet? And can it be consumed daily for my low fibre intake?
15/11/2024, 10:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: I never trust their calories lol

But I'd do what Sameet suggested above. Add extra oil with this entry and move on
15/11/2024, 11:00 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: So how do I track exactly?

Should I just search for Caesar Sandwich and add anything that is close to the calories mentioned and add oil seperately.

Or should I do some trial and error with adding ingredients and trying to come close to the calories mentioned.
15/11/2024, 11:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Doesn’t need to be more complicated than that when eating out
15/11/2024, 11:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just pick an entry that’s similar. Add add 3tsp oil separately
16/11/2024, 8:48 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>

This is the closest thing i found on mfp
16/11/2024, 10:34 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it's close enough
16/11/2024, 10:51 am - PF - Umamah Abbasi: ?
16/11/2024, 10:54 am - Taha Ahmed: Hi, @923117561887 ! 😊 Thanks for sharing this.
16/11/2024, 10:54 am - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Reload - Coffee & Almond
16/11/2024, 10:55 am - Taha Ahmed: Let's break it down to see if it's actually a good high fiber and protein bar
16/11/2024, 10:56 am - Taha Ahmed: I think that this bar is a decent SNACK option for convenience, but it’s not particularly high in fiber or protein. 

Here’s why:
Fiber: At 1.3g per 40g serving, it’s quite low for a food meant to help with fiber intake. For context, women need around 25g/day and men need about 30-35g/day. You’d need to eat quite a few of these to meet your fiber goals, which wouldn’t be ideal calorie-wise.
Protein: 3.2g per bar isn’t much either, especially if you’re struggling to meet your protein target. It might be better paired with a higher-protein option.

For a bar that's advertised as a protein bar, that's got 170 kcal, and 3.2g protein, ISN'T a protein bar.
16/11/2024, 10:58 am - Taha Ahmed: If you want to increase your fiber, Aim for whole food sources like fruits (e.g., berries, apples, pears), veggies, oats, chia seeds, or legumes. A single tablespoon of chia/flex/sesame seeds has 5g fiber! (ofcourse, also a lot more calories too 😋)

You could try Ispaghol husk for fiber 🤷🏽‍♂
16/11/2024, 10:59 am - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Thankyou so much for guiding

I didn’t measure the “paira” but measured the roti before having it.
16/11/2024, 12:22 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
16/11/2024, 12:22 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Is this the correct entry for it?
16/11/2024, 12:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes seems fine
16/11/2024, 12:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>
16/11/2024, 12:28 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Also from past 2 3 days I’m taking 50 more calories. (Fruits) is it possible because I increase my excercise? Im trying to lower it now.
16/11/2024, 12:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 50 calories in addition to what Taha calculated for you upon joining Project FoMo is fine as you have increased your physical activity 
If you look at a bigger picture then lets suppose you are in a deficit of 400ish calories per day which makes it 2800 calories for the whole week now if you are having 50 extra calories per day making 350 for the whole week then you will still be in a deficit just not 2800 calories for the week but 2450 calories
I hope its clear !!
16/11/2024, 1:11 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Yes thankyou so much. But aiming for exact 1300. Also, can you please tell me any alternate excercise for Landmine Anti-Rotation?
16/11/2024, 1:12 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Just a question.
For tea we should only log milk quantity right? But is it before making tea or after 

E.g. I took around 250ml milk but after making tea it ended up 210-215 ml
16/11/2024, 1:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes only milk & the quantity of sugar added
it doesnt matter much if you log before or after because the difference won't be significant enough. ~15 calories
16/11/2024, 1:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Suitcase carry (single arm farmer's walk)
Russian twists
Side plank with hip dips
16/11/2024, 1:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally before. When you boil it some of the water evaporates but the calories still stay the same
16/11/2024, 2:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Can you tell me how to track home made bone broth
16/11/2024, 2:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And what are the best bones to make it lamb
16/11/2024, 2:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Or the broth from meat is the same as bone broth. Like when we make yAkhni .
16/11/2024, 2:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s pretty much the same. 

I’d just search bone broth on the app and  go with an entry similar to this
16/11/2024, 2:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
16/11/2024, 2:36 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Meat and bone broth is same. 

Because when I make yekhni . The fat comes on top.
16/11/2024, 2:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I just wonder if it's beneficial fat or it needs to be discarded
16/11/2024, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Fat is fat, unless it's fish oil
16/11/2024, 2:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. Even though we hear phrases like good fat a lot in the media. 

It’s all fat. 

What makes that fat good compared to other sources of fat? Does it listen to you like a good boy? 🫣🤣
16/11/2024, 2:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it's ghar ka ghee then that's good!

If it's bahir ke fries wala oil... bad boii!! 😈 <This message was edited>
16/11/2024, 2:54 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My question is . Does it need to be discarded
16/11/2024, 2:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re accounting for the calories then not really.
16/11/2024, 2:55 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Or if we consume them thats definitely not 1 g of fat
16/11/2024, 2:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How are you making it? With the meat?
16/11/2024, 2:56 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Biryani is better than yekhni pulao then. Sorry to change the context. Pulao takes in all the fat and added oil. And biryani is made with boiled rice.
16/11/2024, 2:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ye meat with bones
16/11/2024, 2:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Like I was making pulao and thought if I could keep some broth for myself.
16/11/2024, 3:43 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: How is mutton in terms of protein? 
Like calorie to protein ratio 
And beef? 
We have mutton cooked at our house frequently and mfp is quite confusing about the calories
16/11/2024, 3:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah so if you’re accounting for the meat ki calories then the fat is already accounted for. 

Don’t overcomplicate it anymore lol
16/11/2024, 3:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Mutton is highest in terms of calories because it has the most fat. 

Beef comes second and chicken is the leanest. 

You can still have mutton but I’d try to limit it to a few times per week.

The reason I say this is not because of calories but because of saturated fat. 

In Pakistan, we tend to eat a lot of beef and mutton and that can lead to high saturated fat intakes. 

Saturated fat above a certain level has been shown to lead to cholesterol issues, specifically LDL. 

As for searching for an entry, your best bet is to use lamb entries for it.
16/11/2024, 4:00 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Craving desi halwa puri nashta for monthss thinking to have it tommorow calories estimatation pls😭
16/11/2024, 4:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: Calories estimate? A solid 800-1000 calories depending on how generous your halwa-to-puri ratio is (and let’s be real, the oily af halwa always wins 😂).
16/11/2024, 4:03 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: IMG-20241116-WA0013.jpg (file attached)

…and we were told that mutton is the best option in terms of health and nutrition
16/11/2024, 4:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: ~140 calories
16/11/2024, 4:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then ~600-800
16/11/2024, 4:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: 🙊🙊

16/11/2024, 5:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But probably 600-650
16/11/2024, 5:55 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
estimated calories pls. this was a jumbo shawarma MFP is giving me a range from 550-800. one is even 1400.
16/11/2024, 5:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you have it at home or outside?
16/11/2024, 5:59 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: outside
16/11/2024, 5:59 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i mean it was takeaway. but bahar ka tha ._.
16/11/2024, 6:28 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: I’ve a stupid question but anyways,1 tbsp oil is 120 calories so how is this whole around 140? @923343773307 ( did you consider 1 tsp that’s 40 calories)
16/11/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Oil is totally fat. So best way IMO is to weight it and then multiply it with 9 to get the calories.
E.g. 1 tbsp is around 15g so 15x9=135 cal would be a better estimate
16/11/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Sorry to sound dumb but I didn’t get it
16/11/2024, 7:36 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Oh I see. You were asking Taha about the calories in the whole meal.
16/11/2024, 7:37 pm - PF - Ali Haider: This is definitely more than 140 calories. Depends on the weight.
16/11/2024, 7:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s hard to track workout weight. 

This is why using a scale is important. 

I’d go with cooked garbanzo beans 40g
Chicken 10g
Oil 2tsp
16/11/2024, 7:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For this, a regular shawarma is 550 calories. So jumbo can very easily be 800-900 if not more. 

Most of the calories come from the garlic cause so I usually ask them to use very less of that
16/11/2024, 7:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: It may have more calories for sure. 

To estimate it, I used cooked values: 5tbsp channa salan (80-100 kcal) and 1.5tbsp as an average.(30-40)

There's a lot of water in both as well!
16/11/2024, 7:49 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Bhai na kro 😭
16/11/2024, 7:52 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Is Garlic high in calories? 👀
16/11/2024, 7:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: He probably meant garlic mayo*
16/11/2024, 7:53 pm - PF - Ali Haider: *garlic sauce.. yes it is very high. As far as I know 1 serving (15g) has more than 100 calories
16/11/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Oh yea that makes sense... I had algérienne sauce and I was shocked to see the calories in 30g
16/11/2024, 8:20 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: thanks for that. ill keep that in mind
16/11/2024, 10:27 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>

17/11/2024, 12:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Garlic sauce* the one used in Arabic cuisine.
17/11/2024, 12:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s either yoghurt based or garlic sauce.
17/11/2024, 12:08 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Not garlic, its yogurty
17/11/2024, 12:10 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
17/11/2024, 12:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search for white sauce.
17/11/2024, 12:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or just add half mayo and half Greek yogurt
17/11/2024, 12:35 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: This looks ok?
17/11/2024, 12:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah

17/11/2024, 3:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Doesn’t matter cause you’re still under your calories.
17/11/2024, 3:07 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 😊

17/11/2024, 12:07 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 😭😭
17/11/2024, 12:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: An easy way to figure it out is that just a scoop of ice cream is going to be 250-300
17/11/2024, 12:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 100-150
17/11/2024, 12:10 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Yeah i thought it too that i is gonna be high calorie but this was only option for me at gyms cafe forgot to take preworkout at home and mama won’t let me do workout empty stomach now have to do breakfast then snacks and then dinner in 1000 cals and protein goal dk how will i manage
17/11/2024, 12:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If that’s the reason, then just have fruits next time for some energy.
17/11/2024, 2:31 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Is haleem a good source of protein
17/11/2024, 2:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Depends on how it's made. If it's got a good amount of meat. Then yes. Otherwise no!
17/11/2024, 2:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCBfJaEIuu9/?igsh=N3RxdGNzMHlzNGNl

This is how 0% fat paratha is made
17/11/2024, 4:27 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: How many calories it is actually?
My guess is 1500 for one paratha like this
17/11/2024, 4:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can easily be higher. 2000-3000 too
17/11/2024, 4:32 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: 😱 muje maroo muje maroo😅

17/11/2024, 5:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just search cooked lentils
17/11/2024, 5:19 pm - PF - Izma Arshad: is having daal actually a good protein option? Like just some plain daal cooked no spices or baghaar
17/11/2024, 5:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Add 80g
17/11/2024, 5:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll take weird without any spices. 

Spices don’t have calories so why aren’t you using them?

As for protein, well 100g of uncooked daal has 20g of protein.
17/11/2024, 5:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That would make 300 or more of cooked daal
17/11/2024, 8:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Absolutely. Massive dough + the generous application of pure samin (ghee) that thing is calorie monster
17/11/2024, 8:52 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: They opened an outlet here but it's a bit far so I've not been there but I really want to try it. They do allll sorts of fillings as well

17/11/2024, 10:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll be high because they’re deep fried.
17/11/2024, 10:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Doesn’t it mention calories at the back!?

17/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 kardo
17/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use kfc wings for each wing you have

17/11/2024, 10:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just do Apple for the amount of ml you think it has.
17/11/2024, 10:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s 500ml. 

Do 400ml
Of Apple juice
17/11/2024, 10:50 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): So should i enter apple juice or apple in mfp
17/11/2024, 10:50 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Okay
17/11/2024, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Apple juice.
17/11/2024, 10:57 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
Had 6 wings so I put this entry instead of tracking each wing? Is this correct? Or next time I should put entry of each wing?
17/11/2024, 11:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d go with each entry because hot wings are something else. They’re smaller.
17/11/2024, 11:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
17/11/2024, 11:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: See I changed it to 6 wings
17/11/2024, 11:16 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: I feel so bad now. If it’s around 780 I exceeded my calories today. But I measured each wing it was around 30 to 33g. Here, serving size is 52g? But if I choose this entry I’ve exceeded 191 calories ☹️( trying not to eat outside but weekends are busy for me)
17/11/2024, 11:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 191 isn’t that bad. Plus this might be an overestimatation. So even though it looks like you exceeded it, in reality you might not have.
17/11/2024, 11:35 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey guys, had chicken handi and chicken karahi from outside, any tips on how should i calculate it? I think it wasn’t 3 tbps of oil🤣
17/11/2024, 11:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Picture please
17/11/2024, 11:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the portion
17/11/2024, 11:57 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Well, I should have taken a picture, but was sitting with the guys, so hesitated to take one, so in terms of memory I guess the portion sizes were equivalent to my fist/hand
17/11/2024, 11:57 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: <Media omitted>
This is a picture of the handi for reference
17/11/2024, 11:58 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: it tastes so so good 😅😂
18/11/2024, 12:11 am - PF - Maryam Furqan: Happiest Birthday 🥳🥳🥳
18/11/2024, 12:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Frontier is the best. 

But you didn’t have the full thing Na. 

So probably 150-200g chicken or mutton and 4tsp oil. Plus naan and all
18/11/2024, 12:25 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Only real ones know that frontier handi tops all <This message was edited>
18/11/2024, 1:17 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: How do I log the entry of 123g of paira (uncooked i measured)I made to make roti.
18/11/2024, 1:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably close to 90g of roti. 

Try weighing the roti next time.
18/11/2024, 1:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 90g roti would be 200ish
18/11/2024, 1:32 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Never weighed my roti before . I thought It would be accurate measuring the dough ball
18/11/2024, 1:46 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Used to do the same 🫥
18/11/2024, 1:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a guess either way. The dough has a lot of water so we don’t know how much water there is. 

The only accurate way is to measure the flour before you make the dough. But that’s usually not possible
18/11/2024, 1:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And so we estimate calories based on the size of the roti in grams

Generally, 50g roti is 120 calories n
18/11/2024, 2:18 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 👌🏽👌🏽
18/11/2024, 2:45 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I logged 90 g of roti
18/11/2024, 4:44 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
Google says 230 calories..is that ok? It’s from a local halal pizza place not food chain
18/11/2024, 4:46 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. For things like this, just use a standard entry
18/11/2024, 4:46 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For instance is just use a slice of dominos large pizza
18/11/2024, 4:52 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Gotit
18/11/2024, 6:24 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I marinated chicken (raw 883g)in a cilantro dressing (6 tbsp). No oil. 
If i’m having 82g (will track 82*1.35) cooked do i need to track the dressing or consider it evaporated?
18/11/2024, 6:25 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: There is cooked chkn breast on macros so will track 82g
18/11/2024, 6:53 am - Taha Ahmed: If there's no oil in cilantro dressing (or anything that has calories like sauces, mayo, yogurt), then I'd just let it be and only track chicken.
18/11/2024, 7:41 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Has mayo dressing in the ing. Tracking 1 tsp?

18/11/2024, 11:49 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): So 100g cooked chicken?

18/11/2024, 12:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d track 10g of it
18/11/2024, 12:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 120-130g
18/11/2024, 12:15 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And oil?
18/11/2024, 12:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search and see what you find. Probably 30-50 calories per piece depending on size.
18/11/2024, 12:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is it fried?
18/11/2024, 12:15 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Yes deep fried
18/11/2024, 12:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just use fried chicken ki entry. Search dynamite chicken or chicken tenders or kfc hot shots
18/11/2024, 1:09 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: This is heavens! but going to choke us too!
18/11/2024, 1:19 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>

18/11/2024, 1:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes
18/11/2024, 1:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah decent hai.
18/11/2024, 1:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just keep in mind that hot shots are smaller in size so account for that. 10 of these dynamite chicken pieces are probably bigger than 10 hot shots.
18/11/2024, 2:08 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Yeah i ate less then 10.
18/11/2024, 2:22 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: how many calories would 100g of yoghurt have? not packed. mfp is showing different calories for different brands

18/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 151g was atta or roti?
18/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For the beef you’ll need to add oil seperately
18/11/2024, 7:27 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: Roti
18/11/2024, 7:28 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: Made it without oil

100 kcal 😳😨
18/11/2024, 7:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then search chapati and add 151g of that. Will be around 360-375 calories.
18/11/2024, 7:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Itna tou hota hi hai lol
18/11/2024, 7:35 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: So it doesn’t matter which type of flour or company you’re using ? I have chosen chapati of same flour and brand ?
18/11/2024, 7:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. The difference is very minor at best.
18/11/2024, 7:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cause 151g of atta would make like 4-5 roti
18/11/2024, 7:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 1 Sachet - 1000 calories. 😂 
Like more than half of my target of the day. 🫢 But
#cravings sometimes. Lol.
18/11/2024, 7:39 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: No the weight of cooked roti was 151 g 😛
18/11/2024, 7:43 pm - PF - Ali Haider: That will be around 400-450ish calories.
I remember because yesterday I had a 160g roti
18/11/2024, 7:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Full sachet also has 10 servings so if you have 10 servings then obviously lol
18/11/2024, 7:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. So that’s going 360-380 calories. 

Generally 50g roti is about 120 calorie.
18/11/2024, 7:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Usko roti nahin kehtay 😂
18/11/2024, 7:49 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I specifically requested for the lightest weight possible and this was what my mother made.. 😅.

Normally she makes 240-250gm roti
18/11/2024, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d love to see this roti.
18/11/2024, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The ones in our house are 40g 😂😂
18/11/2024, 7:50 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Will definitely share a picture next time
18/11/2024, 7:52 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: Ok thank you 😊

Like my question is two fold - this is spinach - rice - potatoes and indian terms it’s saag so what should my entry be in myfitnesspal and how should i accurately track its calories
19/11/2024, 12:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rice 250g
Potato’s 150g
Oil 4tsp

Easier to estimate if you weigh these things separately.
19/11/2024, 12:58 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Can i weigh it after it’s cooked as opposed to weighing it before, cuz i dont make my meals
19/11/2024, 12:59 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: And what about dressing on top of the rice, which is spinach
19/11/2024, 12:59 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes you can track either way cooked or raw.
19/11/2024, 1:00 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): weight that too & log
19/11/2024, 1:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Spinach won’t have much calories but if you weigh it then you can track them
19/11/2024, 1:05 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Okay, thank you
19/11/2024, 1:55 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
chicken karahi
 is 2tsp oil ok for the entry?
19/11/2024, 2:29 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks pretty oily. I’d do 3tsp

19/11/2024, 8:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 350-450. 

@923441183411 what do you think?
19/11/2024, 8:10 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): It was a very small size🥲 i think looking big in picture
19/11/2024, 8:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 350-380
looks like a 100ish gram slice
19/11/2024, 8:12 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
19/11/2024, 8:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 3 milk with chocolate topping 350 is a safe estimate
19/11/2024, 8:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Well, I'm learning to track day by day. 👍 Hehehe
19/11/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Zabardast👌
19/11/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm very bad at having protein via food. How should I complete my protein goal?
19/11/2024, 8:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to adjust your food choices to an extent. 

For example, most people have 1 egg for breakfast and that’s not a well rounded meal. 


If you want to have eggs, 3 eggs is minimum to get enough protein. Or less eggs but then add protein through other sources like cheese, sausages or cottage cheese.
19/11/2024, 8:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but it’s cake. 

Packed with things like cream, condensed milk and sugar. So small sizes are packed with calories too. 

The full cake is easily 2500-3000 calories if not higher. 

I’ll give you an example, have you heard about the Cheesecake Factory?

Unki aik slice of cake (it’s a bigger slice but still a slice) has about 1200-1700 calories. <This message was edited>
19/11/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 😳
19/11/2024, 8:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just keep it simple do not over complicate
eggs, chicken, beef, fish, greek yogurt etc. are some of the protein dominant sources. Add atleast one of these in your meals. 
If you are struggling to complete through whole foods then adding a scoop of whey will help alot
19/11/2024, 8:34 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
What would be a good estimate for this? (Without cherry)
95 grams black forest cake.

I estimated it to be around 285
19/11/2024, 8:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Decent estimate
19/11/2024, 8:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: With cakes and all, I usually overestimate. 

So if I think it’s 350, I’ll record 400. And so on. Just to be safe.
19/11/2024, 8:40 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 285 is decent 
320-340 just to be safe
19/11/2024, 8:59 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Bhai sb aj cake kio kha rahy ho 😭
19/11/2024, 9:00 pm - PF - Ali Haider: What a coincidence
19/11/2024, 9:00 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: 200 gms fruit chaat (apples, bananas, anar and grapes) Macro is showing 94 cal For mixed friit. 
Ok or more?
19/11/2024, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just do 50g of each fruit
19/11/2024, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you add anything else to the fruits?
19/11/2024, 9:03 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Will add chaat masala
19/11/2024, 9:03 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Easily over 150 calories!
19/11/2024, 9:03 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I did weigh all the fruit separately before mixing
19/11/2024, 9:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Great then just make a separate entry for each fruit
19/11/2024, 9:08 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I made a big batch. Will track 1/4 of each fruit
19/11/2024, 9:09 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: So that it equals 200 gms
19/11/2024, 9:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Sounds good

Is it a good idea to have this every other day to curb cravings/hunger? And are the calories accurate? Its 160 for 4 bowls
19/11/2024, 9:43 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
Instead of opting for donut or cake slice (since I was craving something sweet) I ended up eating chicken but it was full of oil and chicken was less but like there was one full naan. Had half naan and left half of it. Naan and chicken was mixed with Salan which was soo oily. Anyways, can you tell me what till be the calories of this around?
19/11/2024, 9:43 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
19/11/2024, 9:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): make an entry in MFP for  
Half Naan
Chicken leg boneless (55-60g)
Chicken breast boneless (45-50g)
oil 3-4tsp
19/11/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 4 tou hoga hi. Looks delicious. What is this?
19/11/2024, 10:12 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: It was Tawa chicken from Jahangir. Yess, it was spicy and delicious.

First tracking day to end. Hehehe. I appreciate myself with more 250 calorie deficit than planned. 

And I hope, this chart will get better. Good Night fellows!
20/11/2024, 12:13 am - Taha Ahmed: You’re going to want to prioritize more protein btw. It’s something we often take for granted, but if you don’t get enough, you risk losing muscle mass, which is exactly what we want to avoid when losing weight. :/
20/11/2024, 12:13 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Adjusted the oil after this so 660 calories left
20/11/2024, 12:14 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Trying my best but eggs made my stomach upset 😔 so didn't have today
20/11/2024, 12:14 am - Taha Ahmed: That's great. 

How many calories did you consume overall?
20/11/2024, 12:17 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
A rough tough work from home today. Lol.  1500-1600 calories are the goal.
20/11/2024, 12:24 am - Taha Ahmed: This is good. Today was your first day so that’s fine. Just make sure your energy intake is consistent on most days to avoid experiencing energy withdrawals and cravings... all these things work in synchronicity
20/11/2024, 12:26 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yeah.  I shall try to. 👍
20/11/2024, 12:26 am - Taha Ahmed: Hmm! I know you don’t want to have meat, and that’s fine. Have you ever tried having tofu, tempeh, or seitan consistently? They're all more balanced sources of plant-based protein.
20/11/2024, 12:27 am - Taha Ahmed: Awesome. Keep sharing with us so we can guide you better! 😊
20/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Ali Hassan: No never 🫠
20/11/2024, 12:29 am - Taha Ahmed: Then I think you should explore tofu or tempeh. If your body can handle gluten well, then Seitan is also an excellent food type you can have every single day
20/11/2024, 12:29 am - Taha Ahmed: No need to have eggs on a regular basis if it upsets your tummy <This message was edited>
20/11/2024, 12:29 am - PF - Ali Hassan: As far as i know never had any sort of problem with gluten till now
20/11/2024, 12:30 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Tofu is like paneer ?
20/11/2024, 12:31 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, but it's usually made with soy milk instead of dairy
20/11/2024, 12:31 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Oh
20/11/2024, 12:34 am - Taha Ahmed: https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/the-quickest-and-easiest-seitan-recipe-vegan-chicken/
try this! 

Seitan is basically wheat's gluten and 100g wheat-based seitan can have upto 25g of protein
20/11/2024, 12:34 am - Taha Ahmed: It's why its plant-based

@923343773307 which mfp entry is best to use for recording cooked salmon?
20/11/2024, 12:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Cooked salmon should have about ~230-250 calories / per 100g (if more oil is used then stay on the higher end) <This message was edited>
20/11/2024, 12:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
1. It's definitely cooked with a lot of oil that's why the calorie count is high

2. it's cooked in the oven with little or no oil it seems

3. a fillet is about 200g that's why 468 calories (looks like a good fit as well)
20/11/2024, 12:32 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: This was a first try making salmon at home so I opted for oven baked. As per my sister, she only used 1 tsp oil and it was good she didn't use more as the salmon released a lot of its own oil
20/11/2024, 12:33 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I'll be making a post on Facebook with details
20/11/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I think I'll use the second entry and add 1 tsp oil separately just to be safe
20/11/2024, 12:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then max 280 calories/100g
20/11/2024, 12:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sure thing!
20/11/2024, 12:36 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
While jotting down yesterday, this is what I had originally used
20/11/2024, 12:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Close enough
20/11/2024, 12:42 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
Almost 10 g difference in protein and 16 g in fat 🤔
20/11/2024, 12:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g raw salmon has about 140-150 calories/100g and 22ish gm protein
20/11/2024, 12:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g cooked salmon has about 25ish gm protein
20/11/2024, 12:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Now it depends on the salmon too, if it's wild caught or farmed
20/11/2024, 12:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just sharing it for educational purposes
20/11/2024, 12:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Don't need to get caught up in the nitty gritties
20/11/2024, 12:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Makes sense
20/11/2024, 12:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just pick one option which is the closest and move on
20/11/2024, 12:47 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Okay so based of this, I'd like to proceed with the initial entry. Hope that's fine
20/11/2024, 12:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup that's good
20/11/2024, 12:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thank you for the breakdown. These days I'm starting to pay attention to the macros in food as well so I can judge the entries on mfp better. Helps with my food choices too 🙌🏼

Rice were 200g. I wanted to ask should I add oil entry aswell? I asked my mom total oil used was 1tbsp for vegetables. And do I have to account for carrots( na honay ke barabar the) and peas?
20/11/2024, 2:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add 1tsp of oil
20/11/2024, 2:56 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: @60193244266  why do we not track veges mostly?
20/11/2024, 2:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because it’s a lot of effort for 10-30 calories.
20/11/2024, 2:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus if we want to reduce calories, we don’t really want to cut out vegetables
20/11/2024, 4:18 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: makes sense

20/11/2024, 5:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: 👀
20/11/2024, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d maybe estimate 800ish for the combined things. 

Half eggs thing and full burger wannabe.
20/11/2024, 5:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's only one egg in shakshuka and burger thingy had one egg

20/11/2024, 5:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Shahshuka with one egg will be closer to 300
20/11/2024, 5:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So 750 calories total
20/11/2024, 5:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Where are you going for food lol
20/11/2024, 5:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ok . Then what should I add in my log ? More

20/11/2024, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're in a caloric deficit then yes, ofcourse!
20/11/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: And we will become rich like him too.
20/11/2024, 6:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: You could workout for 5 hours a day, walk 20000 steps daily, sleep for 9 hours, have 0% stress, but if you aren't in a deficit, you won't lose weight 😋
20/11/2024, 6:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: Jitna marzi insulin spike or blood glucose control karlain, koi faida nahi hona phir bhi 😂
20/11/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I guess even if we aren't in calorie deficit and struggle the way he acted, "girta tha chalta tha" Tau not sure about weight but will reach Allah miyan k pas soon

20/11/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: How do you measure body fat muscle ratio accurately ?
20/11/2024, 6:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Post kerun Facebook per or I will get answer here ?
20/11/2024, 6:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: The most accurate methods would be DEXA scans, hydrostatic weighing, and BIA (bioelectrical impedance analysis ). DEXA is considered the gold standard as it provides a detailed breakdown of fat, muscle, and bone density, but it's too expensive. 

If you want to know whether you should get it done or not, then yes, make a FB post, we'll discuss it there.
20/11/2024, 6:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Which ones are in the gym. ? I haven't got it checked. But i wasn't sure if it's accurate. By just standing and spreading arms one.
20/11/2024, 6:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Those are BIA (mostly), and have a huge margin of error

Hey coaches,
I need guidance, at what time I should take these (Vit D3, Omega 3 and cernturm multivitmin) for effective results. Vit. D3 I usually take after breakfast (when I take eggs).
20/11/2024, 6:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Preferably in the morning, along with food
20/11/2024, 6:53 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Relatable 🥲 last night went for a walk to complete my 10k steps everything was slippery slop
20/11/2024, 6:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: All 3 of these?
20/11/2024, 6:55 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: He spend his whole life walking. So if you want results follow him. I m not sure about weight loss but yes soul loss for 😃 rip
20/11/2024, 6:55 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Sorry for jumping the question.... I use boditrax at the gym, how accurate are these machines ?
20/11/2024, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, cause they're all different things.
If you were taking multivitamin twice then you could have one cap in the morning, one at night
20/11/2024, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not sure about boditrax, but most of the machines available at the gyms are some form of BIA <This message was edited>
20/11/2024, 6:57 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Should I take Inositol at noon then? Or along with these is fine.

I usually take the Inositol dose after my breakfast to control pcos. <This message was edited>
20/11/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I slipped last night due to black ice, almost met my creator 👀

20/11/2024, 6:59 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Close enough, you need to live, forget about staying fit. Jaan hai Tau Jahan hai. 😁 Or walk on treadmill

How to add entries for these nuggets and sauces? 
These are homemade grilled chicken and boiled potato nuggets.
20/11/2024, 7:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's a kind of BIA - you step on those metals and it runs electric current through the body and then tells you how much body fat %you have, muscle mass and your bone density etc

There are a lot of limitations to use this kind of thing tho so I just almost never use it
20/11/2024, 7:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you weigh any of the ingredients? And do you know how much each nugget weighs?
20/11/2024, 7:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can take it whenever you want. I don't think there's any nutrient interaction that would affect its intake, right? @60193244266
20/11/2024, 7:07 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: Didn’t weigh the ingredients, made them before joining fomo 😁
I had 4 of these weighing 130g
20/11/2024, 7:11 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Limitation as in what ? These are safe right? 👀🤡
20/11/2024, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Make a post on FB, and I'll explain it to you haha!

Limitations in these things are my favorite (the nuances so many people tend to overlook), and I absolutely love talking about them
20/11/2024, 7:17 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCmCZUuuTaj/?igsh=cTJxYzBpaDRtaTQ5

@923343773307 
@60193244266 

Is there any truth to this because this opposes the cycle of bulking and cutting to gain more muscle mass and to look leaner
20/11/2024, 7:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's okay.

So if 4 nuggets weigh 130g, then each nugget weighs 32.5g (130/4).
Let's say chicken to potato ratio is 50/50!
Then each nugget has 15g chicken and 17.5g potato:

Chicken (~15g) = ~30 kcal
Potato (~17.5g) = ~15 kcal

Total per nugget = ~45 kcal.

*OPTION #1:*
If I had 4 of these, I'd juts pick 4 k&ns nuggets and track them (but those may have slightly more protein than these cause of potatoes)

*OPTION #2*
If I want to go crazy and track even the tiny detail, then I'd track is like this.

15g chicken x 4  = 60g chicken breast, raw
17.5g potato x 4 = 70g boiled potato
I'd skip the crumbs 

Then I'd track oil used in cooking <This message was edited>
20/11/2024, 7:20 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will make a post in the evening inshallah . I want to know too. School pick up time now.
20/11/2024, 7:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Great question to discuss on FB!

I already have an answer to this and will address it on FB! Make a post and tag us there 🙏🏽 appreciate it! <This message was edited>

20/11/2024, 7:21 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also I need some recommendation buying a walking pad for home. As it's extremely cold outside . Today was 0 in the morning . So I have my steps at home.
20/11/2024, 7:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this requires a detailed answer so yea FB post would be much appropriate
20/11/2024, 7:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Like the idea of it!
It can definitely help stay active (alot of people become lazy /or inactive because of the extreme weather conditions)

21/11/2024, 12:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve weighed it once. 370 is a good estimate.
21/11/2024, 12:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And next time you can ask them to use less butter to further drop calories
21/11/2024, 12:35 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I didn't taste any better but i think they do add some
21/11/2024, 12:35 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I ordered cheese flavour, butter was mentioned as a separate flavour but just to be safe I'll add it
21/11/2024, 12:36 am - Taha Ahmed: Sweet corn is always made with butter, otherwise you won't even like it, trust me! :p
21/11/2024, 12:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: They add it for sure but next time just ask them not to. I always do
21/11/2024, 12:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I do like it without butter lol. Just lemon and red chili
21/11/2024, 12:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I make it at home without better just some lemon and chaat masala 😂😂

Is this correct for 90gms of cooked chana daal? 1 tbsp oil is separate
21/11/2024, 3:17 am - Taha Ahmed: Looks good. 1tbsp oil sounds a lot tho, did it have a lot of oil?
21/11/2024, 3:18 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Raw weight was 200g.
21/11/2024, 3:19 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Total oil was 1 tbsp
21/11/2024, 3:22 am - Taha Ahmed: So cooked daal's weight would be around 500ish grams (because of water)

If you had 90g, that's ~18% of 500g cooked chana daal

1tbsp oil = 15g
18% of 15g oil = ~2.7g (or 0.5 tspn)
21/11/2024, 4:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d still add 1tsp just to be safe though
21/11/2024, 1:02 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: does green chutney have calories? 😅 home made
21/11/2024, 1:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: only if it's got oil or yogurt or mayo lol :) <This message was edited>

loads of calories right there :))
21/11/2024, 1:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: how did you make it?
21/11/2024, 1:11 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Same green chatni Mai with oil aur cheese nuts add karlo Tou SAE hoga?

How to know which entry is correct? A lot of difference between macros
21/11/2024, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is for raw chicken
21/11/2024, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Actually both aren’t bad. 

The first one has correct macros but uski calories ghalat hain. It’s actually closer to 170-180 which is fine.
21/11/2024, 3:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Stick with this and use this entry moving forward. Simple.
21/11/2024, 4:04 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: I’m actually concerned about fat … left few grams for today
21/11/2024, 4:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can eat fewer carbs today and have more fats. You'll be fine as long as you're under your calorie target
21/11/2024, 4:07 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: Yeah that’ll work 👍

It has musami, water and black pepper only. No sugar. How many calories this would be? My mom made it so idk how many she used 

First meal of the day at 5pm🙃
21/11/2024, 4:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Did you measure musami ?
21/11/2024, 5:00 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: No my mom made it so I don’t know amount of muasami used
21/11/2024, 5:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Let's say it's 50% juice, 50% water
315/2 = 156ml
21/11/2024, 5:06 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): was about to upload almost a similar entry

21/11/2024, 5:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: Unless your mom added sugar in it? 👀
21/11/2024, 5:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha I just saw^
21/11/2024, 5:10 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: No she knows I have no sugar policy strictly in anything she makes for me 😂
21/11/2024, 5:10 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: And it also was too bland to have sugar in it
21/11/2024, 5:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then you can choose either of the enteries

21/11/2024, 5:19 pm - PF - Ali Haider: @923441183411 why this has only 100 calories whereas the sugarcane juice is 300?...😅
Not fair
21/11/2024, 5:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Carb content (sugar and fiber)
Citrus fruits like lime, lemon, and oranges contain a lot of fiber, thanks to their pulp, which makes up a good portion of their content. On the other hand, sugarcane has very little fiber since it’s primarily used for extracting sugar.

Sugarcane naturally has a much higher sugar content, which is why it's the primary source for producing table sugar, and then there's beetroot, etc.
21/11/2024, 5:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sorry I was itching to answer this^
21/11/2024, 5:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): because of the higher sugar content
21/11/2024, 5:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): thankyou @923343773307 
its hard to type such long texts😄
21/11/2024, 5:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I would have done the same if it was a hypertrophy or a training question😄
21/11/2024, 5:26 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Does it count as NEAT when you are working with deep focus and typing?
Its a silly question but I was just curious <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 5:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I have a much simpler answer to this. 

They added water to it to dilute it 😂
21/11/2024, 5:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you add water to sugarcane, then it’ll also be 150 kcals
21/11/2024, 5:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Typing? On a keyboard. Not really. It’s still activity but you’re not burning loads of energy.
21/11/2024, 5:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Only if you're jumping around or running while typing :p
21/11/2024, 5:33 pm - PF - Ali Haider: شاید آپ یہ کہنا چاہ رہے تھے کہ کوئی آپکو بھی مسمی کا جوس پلا دے۔۔
21/11/2024, 5:41 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How many calories are in 7 almonds?
21/11/2024, 5:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 5:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Right. 49 calories
21/11/2024, 5:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 👌
21/11/2024, 5:49 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: <Media omitted>
Does this look accurate? Mainly calories and protein? 
Will weigh the kababs (after being cooked)
21/11/2024, 5:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for actual peshawari chapli kebab ?
hotel wala or homemade?
21/11/2024, 5:55 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Chicken aur beef Dono ki calories?
21/11/2024, 6:00 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: <Media omitted>
Calories for this? I forgot to measure before making. I took 6 tablespoons rice , 2 medium sized chicken breast and veggies
21/11/2024, 6:00 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: And 1/2 tbsp mayo
21/11/2024, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d just search beef and oil. Don’t search for the name of the dish. It won’t be accurate.
21/11/2024, 6:01 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: For marination I took 1 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp red chili powder 
1tbsp dijon mustard
1 tbsp garlic paste 
A pinch of salt and pepper
Half a lemon
21/11/2024, 6:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Beef Keema they use for making chapli kebab at restraunts has more fat than what we use at home. 
so it would use 70/30 beef (measure the kebab & log accordingly) & 4-6tsp oil per kebab
21/11/2024, 6:12 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Home made
21/11/2024, 6:12 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: And it’s made without oil
21/11/2024, 6:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The just weight it before cooking
21/11/2024, 6:12 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Minced beef right?
21/11/2024, 6:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And use an entry for 80/20 ground beef
21/11/2024, 6:15 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Okie
21/11/2024, 6:22 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Estimated Calories count for 5-6 tbsp cooked Macroni, how I can calculate it on App? 

A colleague offered me her lunch so I had to join her for courtesy. <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 6:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Reminder: there’s nothing wrong with not eating something if you don’t want to. 

We’ve unfortunately been taught to be courteous even at the cost of our own goals and you don’t have to do that. 

This where boundaries come in. 

Anyways, I’d estimate it as 30g cooked pasta and half a tsp of oil. <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 6:32 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @60193244266 beef ho ya chicken chapli kabab 1000 calories tak Tou ho gay he oil ki waja say bi?
21/11/2024, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1000 nahin hosakhti aik kebab main hahaha
21/11/2024, 6:36 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): chicken ma considerably km hon gi 
beef ma bhi 1000 ka koe chance nhi.
21/11/2024, 6:51 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Restaurant chapli kabab mai 1000 say ziyada hogi ya Kam?
21/11/2024, 6:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Kum.
21/11/2024, 6:52 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Ok SAE SAE
21/11/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
How much calories?
21/11/2024, 7:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 350-400 probably.
21/11/2024, 7:13 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 200 in icecream and 200 in brownie?
21/11/2024, 7:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I did 150 in soft serve ice cream and 250 in brownie
21/11/2024, 7:44 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: how do you track curry pakora? 😅
i havent had it yet but i wanted to check calories and macros beforehand
21/11/2024, 7:49 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
found these options
21/11/2024, 9:08 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: My fav 🫠🥲
21/11/2024, 9:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Tricky haha!
It's mostly going to be carbs so weigh your portion if possible and then pick the first entry 271kcal / 100g and add a bit oil separately
21/11/2024, 9:15 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Pakoray deep fried hote so how much oil per pakora ? 🫠 Asking because this is one of my fav foods lol
21/11/2024, 9:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha

A. LOT. OF. OIL! 🙊
21/11/2024, 9:25 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid joined from the community
21/11/2024, 9:55 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: I'm skipping 😅
21/11/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): For deep fried how much oil to estimate? Like for fries or chicken hot shots?
21/11/2024, 9:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: estimate about 10-15% of their weight as absorbed oil
21/11/2024, 9:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g of fries might absorb around 10-15g of oil (90-135 calories)
21/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i had fried fish and sameet suggested 4tsp oil :p
21/11/2024, 9:58 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i assumed all deep fried would have 4tsp
21/11/2024, 9:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use KFC entries
21/11/2024, 9:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the product but easiest to find similar products
21/11/2024, 9:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nuggets - McDonald’s nuggets
Fries - McDonald’s fries (adjust serving size based on how many you had)
And beef burger - quarter pounder 
Fried chicken - KFC

So on and so forth
21/11/2024, 10:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And then you don’t need to do this complication
21/11/2024, 10:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: @60193244266's shared the easiest hack of all. Just do this and you'll be good with most of your tracking
21/11/2024, 10:36 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Hi is it alright if i share a pic of food here to confirm i have tracked it correctly?
21/11/2024, 10:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, go ahead!
21/11/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 10:38 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Its almost like 500 calories for 3 boiled eggs and 1 avacado
21/11/2024, 10:38 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I forgot to add the cookie but its another 80 calories
21/11/2024, 10:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: How much almond milk did you use to make that cup of coffee? <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 10:39 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Almost 1.5 cup so kind of like 12 ounces
21/11/2024, 10:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1 cup of almond milk is about 50 calories, so 1.5 cups = 75 calories. If it’s sweetened, add those calories too (sugar).

Everything else looks good... just don’t forget to log the cookie! 😊
21/11/2024, 10:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, Avocado has a lot of calories due to its higher fat content
21/11/2024, 10:45 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Huh i need to fix this then lol.. thank god i checked.. i use monk fruit sweetener 1 tsp.. so my fitness app shows it has 0 calories
21/11/2024, 10:46 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: But i will log that as well.. and done for the cookie too
21/11/2024, 10:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, non-nutritive sweeteners like stevia, monk fruit etc are all zero calories so no need to track it. Only sugar if you had it because that's got calories.

Can you also share the nutrients tab where it shows how much protein, carbs and fats you've eaten?

Scroll down on this diary's page > nutrition > nutrients (middle one at the top) <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 10:50 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Sure let me send you that
21/11/2024, 10:50 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 10:50 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: That was a whole lot of fat lol
21/11/2024, 10:51 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I thought 3 eggs would be a lot of proteins..
21/11/2024, 10:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's okay. Just wanted to bring that to your awareness so we can make more informed choices later, as there's defo more room for improvement :)
21/11/2024, 10:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1egg=6ish g of protein

also the almond milk or avocado doesn't offer any protein either
21/11/2024, 10:55 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: How do i add more protein? Like i usually do some grilled chicken like 200 gm in lunch and some fish at night or just some other kind of chicken
21/11/2024, 10:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: Let's have a look at your daily food intake (whole day's diary) and then we can see where we can improve <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 10:55 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: But it never makes up for my daily protein..
21/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Can i use this as a meal replacement only like when i am on the go amd dont have time for proper meal?
21/11/2024, 10:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes 20g protein & 140 caloroes in it 
can be on the go option
21/11/2024, 10:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: It can be a good snack but not really a meal replacement!
21/11/2024, 10:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes exactly 
not really a meal replacement
21/11/2024, 11:00 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: <Media omitted>
Do I trust this information? 100 calories in 100ml ice cream?
21/11/2024, 11:01 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Ok and i send it here or FB?
21/11/2024, 11:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: FB is better so we can discuss it in detail
21/11/2024, 11:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: By the looks of it and the label, the calculation is okay lol!
Also, it's a big company, so these things are mostly regulated there

and this one has very low fat so maybe that's why the calories are low <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 11:06 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I trusted this & Hico's label myself for good 6-8 weeks when i used to save calories for it on daily basis during my fatloss journey. 
My fatloss went really well
21/11/2024, 11:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just keep in mind 100ml of ice cream is 60g.
21/11/2024, 11:27 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Any plain icecream or icecream in general?
21/11/2024, 11:47 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If my protein budget is 119 and I have exceeded it to 150 staying within my calorie budget.
Would it be ok if I consume less protein the next day ?
22/11/2024, 12:13 am - Taha Ahmed: It'd be better if you stayed consistent and within your given protein range
22/11/2024, 1:28 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: All ice creams
22/11/2024, 1:29 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your body can’t store protein like carbs and fats. So, your body still needs the same amount of protein daily.
22/11/2024, 1:45 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Lol. I read that as 60 calories
22/11/2024, 1:46 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: My bad
22/11/2024, 1:48 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I cooked a mix of raw mung 40g and masur 180g + tomatoes 340g. No oil. This is the pani wali daal. Tracking will be same as sookhi chana or different?
22/11/2024, 1:50 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Calories  estimate? 🥲
22/11/2024, 1:50 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I am still trying to drain the oil I promise 😭
22/11/2024, 1:53 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Almost completed the macro goals today But consumed 59 more calories than planned. #aBusyworkingDay

Well started to walk (initially 20 min) from today after dinner.
22/11/2024, 1:53 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
22/11/2024, 1:53 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): raw lentils 220g (mung+masur) ~ 770-780 calories
Tomato 340 ~ 60 calories
22/11/2024, 1:54 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: So how much will it be for 90 gms cooked?
22/11/2024, 1:54 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 59 calories is fine
22/11/2024, 1:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 100-110 calories
22/11/2024, 1:55 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Thanks
22/11/2024, 1:58 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): is it qeema ?
22/11/2024, 1:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Gravy
22/11/2024, 1:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 😬
22/11/2024, 1:58 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Only gravy ?
22/11/2024, 1:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Qorma hai
22/11/2024, 1:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yes 🫠
22/11/2024, 1:59 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks like 4-5tsp oil from this angle
22/11/2024, 2:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Does my meal range seem fine?

Actually I have to plan/eat on the spot according to day schedules. Sometimes I don't get enough time to cook or plan. <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 2:03 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Oky I will add 6
22/11/2024, 2:04 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if at the end of the day you are eating as per your macros & calories then its all good 
meals can vary depending upon your schedule. Its absolutely fine
22/11/2024, 2:08 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I need some guidance.. so i am not someone who likes beef a lot.. dont have much experience of buying beef.. so what kind of beef to get for more protein than fat? Is it lean meet.. I have heard of these terms but never used them
22/11/2024, 2:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah all lentils are pretty much the same. 

If you’re weighing cooked lentils then just search and track cooked lentils in the apps. 

If you weigh raw lentils, then search and enter raw lentils in the app. 

And account for the oil in both methods.
22/11/2024, 2:13 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Beef generally has more fat than poultry. 

But you can still reduce it by getting leaner cuts of meat. 

Think sirloin and similar cuts that don’t have that visible white layer of fat as much.
22/11/2024, 2:15 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): sirloin tip, top round, eye of round are the leanest cuts
22/11/2024, 2:23 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Got it thanks
22/11/2024, 2:54 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Other than the oil wat about the rest ?
22/11/2024, 2:59 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
22/11/2024, 2:59 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
22/11/2024, 2:59 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Was this tracked properly?
22/11/2024, 3:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Baaki masala aur paani hai ahahaha. And some tomatoes. You can add 150g tomatoes if you want.
22/11/2024, 3:20 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Okay 🙏🏽
22/11/2024, 3:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but add 2tsp oil ki estimation unless you made it without oil.
22/11/2024, 3:21 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I air fried it
22/11/2024, 3:21 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: So almost no oil
22/11/2024, 3:46 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
So this is wats left 😬 I tried my best to leave as much oil as possible, now i am confused how much oil to add... I added 150 grams of tomatoes as recommended by sameet
22/11/2024, 5:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t overthink it. Add 4-5 tsp and move on
22/11/2024, 6:35 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
How ?
22/11/2024, 6:36 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Boiled is better?
22/11/2024, 8:37 am - Taha Ahmed: That's some glitch lol for sure
1 medium egg white has about 13-15 calories
22/11/2024, 8:38 am - PF - Ali Hassan: And protein?
22/11/2024, 8:39 am - Taha Ahmed: 2-3g (half of an egg w yolk)
22/11/2024, 8:40 am - Taha Ahmed: Cooked eggs are better because cooking improves protein digestibility and reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses (salmonella) <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 8:40 am - Taha Ahmed: How you cook your eggs is up to you :)
22/11/2024, 8:40 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Boiled = cooked? 😂 Sorry for asking
22/11/2024, 8:41 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha yes, but then scrambled is also cooked 😋
22/11/2024, 8:42 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I was thinking of having less yolk and more white in scrambled or omelette does this mean i will have less protein?
22/11/2024, 8:43 am - Taha Ahmed: Absolutely. One whole egg has about ~5-6g of protein, having only egg whites will give you half the protein 😥

If you aren't allergic to yolks, have it, it's got tons of vitamins and minerals too! And one whole egg is hardly ~65-80 calories (depending on the size) <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 8:45 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Noted 🙏🏽
22/11/2024, 10:07 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
ive been using this entry @923343773307  i assumed they were large eggs.
22/11/2024, 10:08 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
basically one whole and 2 yolks
22/11/2024, 10:09 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: am i doing it wrong? ._.
22/11/2024, 10:10 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you mean 1 whole & 2 whites
This looks fine. 1 egg whites has 17ish calories
22/11/2024, 10:11 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: so a total of 15g protein is right here, right?
22/11/2024, 10:13 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>
use this for a large sized egg
22/11/2024, 10:14 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 14-15g
22/11/2024, 10:14 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: okay, thankyou!
22/11/2024, 10:57 am - PF - Aminah Kamran: Homemade greek yoghurt has how many calories per 100 g?
22/11/2024, 1:01 pm - PF - Ali Haider: How do you make greek yogurt at home?
22/11/2024, 1:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hang regular yogurt in the fridge for a night
22/11/2024, 1:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
It’ll be close to this
22/11/2024, 1:41 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Means even if we purchase yogurt from a local dairy shop, it will turn into greek after a day in a fridge?? What if we leave it there for a couple of days?
22/11/2024, 1:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: After you hang it for 24 hours. <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 1:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Like this
22/11/2024, 2:13 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 when rough guessing propertions, is it better to overestimate or underestimate to be on the safe side?
22/11/2024, 2:14 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: This message was deleted
22/11/2024, 2:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Always overestimate. Especially if the goal is weight loss
22/11/2024, 2:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That looks like 350g or so of rice.
22/11/2024, 2:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Always better to weigh it so then you can be more accurate with the estimation.
22/11/2024, 2:28 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Yes, i’m looking into ordering a weighing scale, any good brand recommendations?
22/11/2024, 2:28 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: That are really accurate
22/11/2024, 2:30 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Quite a manageable one...I have fried chicken in 2 tbsp  oil and still some oil was left in the pan...
22/11/2024, 2:31 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Ohk means literally hang it.. 😂 
Got it <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 3:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Overestimate - for weight loss

Underestimate - for weight gain (esp when you struggle you eat more)
22/11/2024, 3:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: They're all good honestly, so get whatever's in your budget I guess
22/11/2024, 3:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: You deleted this message
22/11/2024, 6:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay so the method I suggested has some limitations (it's still great for educational purposes and awareness). It's good for deep frying foods that have either no or very less batter (chicken wings, fries, or maybe nuggets). Because the thicker the batter, the more oil it will absorb (think of chicken broast, or pakoras, or fried chicken with a thick crispy batter) and that can significantly increase your caloric intake (without you even knowing about it).

So the method Sameet suggested will work better in those situations. He suggested that you "just use KFC entries for fried chicken, fries or even chicken hot shots.
For example, 
Nuggets - McDonald’s nuggets
Fries - McDonald’s fries (adjust serving size based on how many you had)
And beef burger - quarter pounder 
Fried chicken - KFC
So on and so forth"

And this way you won't need to do complicated calculations like I suggested, unless you want to nerd out and love numbers, etc.

22/11/2024, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: I can't say for sure without seeing what it looks like, but maybe 30g jaggery & 70g boiled rice
22/11/2024, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes! It's best to track it before cooking (more accurate), but you can just add boiled chickpeas (after draining the water) <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
22/11/2024, 6:45 pm - PF - Amna Awais: 1kg rice

22/11/2024, 6:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Because 100g includes rice plus jaggery + water + oil
22/11/2024, 6:50 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Okay 👍

22/11/2024, 7:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: yes, seems good!
if you're tracking pulao, you'll have to add oil too (pulao has broth used in it which has fat) <This message was edited>
22/11/2024, 7:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Its simple pulao without chicken i also tracked the oil used to cook it

Had low fat chicken sausages this time and calories weren’t written on packet but I weight it one was 27 and other was 34g. Am I right for measuring it according to grams instead of brand? Total it was 61g but I think calories should be more. ( it was from kings low fat chicken sausages). Is this entry correct?
22/11/2024, 7:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No this isnt a correct entry

Is it safe to use it (zero calories)?
I have listened to so many side effects about artificial sweeteners things. I don't know about the authentic facts.

Guide please.
22/11/2024, 11:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Its absolutely safe to use artificial sweeteners
22/11/2024, 11:46 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Both have different values
22/11/2024, 11:46 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
22/11/2024, 11:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): check for the serving size on the jar & log accordingly
22/11/2024, 11:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): MyProtein Impact whey has 19g per serving & Impact Whey isolate has 21g protein. 
I'm not sure if the serving size is 25g or 30g but you can check on the jar/bag
22/11/2024, 11:52 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: The scoop is 30g
22/11/2024, 11:52 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I measured it

How to control that?

Regret having hot chocolate but had hot chocolate from shaghf. Not sure how many calories it has? Can you let me know around how many calories it has?
23/11/2024, 12:24 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): First of all stop regretting because you can revert the choice you made all you can do is to make better choices in future. Its alright to enjoy foods/drinks/beverages within your caloric budget. 

~220-250calories
@60193244266 what do you think <This message was edited>
23/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Oh I left more calories for it around 500 so I shouldn’t regret.
23/11/2024, 12:28 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you shouldn't
23/11/2024, 12:28 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it will definitely be within 500
23/11/2024, 12:33 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Definitely not more than 500. It’s mostly milk and chocolate.
23/11/2024, 12:33 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I see protein gains happening soon
23/11/2024, 12:40 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: How does this one taste🙈.. I wnt to get one too but they are usually so expensive and have a horrible after taste..
23/11/2024, 12:41 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
23/11/2024, 12:41 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I have this and I cant drink it without gagging🤢
23/11/2024, 12:41 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): dont get vanilla. 
go for Cookies & cream or strawberry or chocolate
23/11/2024, 12:42 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I have 🔝 this one in chocolate and it’s so difficult to swallow.. the aftertaste is the difficult part.. well i guess I should use this one.. I spent some fortune on it 🥹🥹🥹
23/11/2024, 12:44 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): using more water might help
23/11/2024, 12:49 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Will give that a try👍🏽.. even if i am not doing major workouts, I can still use it right?
23/11/2024, 12:51 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yea 100% 
whey protein just helps you with hitting your daily protein targets if you can't do it with whole foods
23/11/2024, 12:55 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Awesome thanks a lot 🙂
23/11/2024, 12:56 am - PF - Asma Tariq: 🤞
23/11/2024, 1:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Brother brought this for lil brother but I grabbed it 😂

I never had it before, I'm bad in protein intakes so let's try it. I hope it will taste good.
23/11/2024, 1:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I still gag at every protein shake. But really like rule 1 in terms of flavor.
23/11/2024, 1:02 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Kevin Levrone's Protein tastes really good.
23/11/2024, 1:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll always taste better in milk (if calories are a concern, use low fat milk)

Get some extra protein for the milk too. 

And another secret is to add a tsp of instant coffee to it hahaha
23/11/2024, 1:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: But out of the bazillion I’ve tried. 

Tasty whey is unmatched. 

Then comes rule1. 

Or you get clear whey. That tastes like feeling fruit juice but is slightly more expensive.
23/11/2024, 1:04 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Will definitely go for a instant coffee hack. 😂
23/11/2024, 1:20 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Oohhh that sounds much better.. I will add that and try.. coffee smell should overpower the aftertaste.. once this is finished( which i dont know when lol) I probably will buy the other ones you suggested
23/11/2024, 2:10 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923441183411 @60193244266 been using whey protein 80 from protein works, is it a good protein powder? Cuz compared to the others it’s way cheaper.
23/11/2024, 2:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I used to use that when in Pakistan. For 3 years.
23/11/2024, 2:13 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Oh okay, it’s good to go then. The others cost an arm and leg although the flavours are just okay <This message was edited>
23/11/2024, 2:13 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i used it too 
its good for its price
23/11/2024, 2:24 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
this was pulao and chicken shami kababs
78g shami (75% chicken 25% daal) no oil used to cook - i logged it under boiled chicken and cooked lentils
105g chicken from pulao without the bones
rice was 157g
2tsp oil estimate. 

reading the chats made me realize I've been tracking stuff wrong so just wanted to ask if this was done right
23/11/2024, 2:27 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this is spot on.
23/11/2024, 2:27 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: yay!
23/11/2024, 2:28 am - PF - Ali Hassan: If u can get myprotein then try their chocolate brownie one 😍🤤

23/11/2024, 2:29 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Isn't it accurate? 
Should we go for every single ingredient count?
23/11/2024, 2:38 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
23/11/2024, 2:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. This may or may not be accurate since it depends on the ingredients. 

If I use more beef and less lentils. And you use it the other way then calories and protein change.
23/11/2024, 2:39 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I am surprised... Because i loved both strawberry and chocolate brownie
23/11/2024, 2:39 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Might give that a try in near future
23/11/2024, 2:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you don’t know the breakdown then 65% beef and 35% lentils. 

And then the oil you use.
23/11/2024, 2:49 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yeah. I got both ways (count). Thank you!

23/11/2024, 3:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You remove excess water in the process but most of the nutrients like protein (and calories) stay there.

23/11/2024, 11:47 am - Taha Ahmed: You can make a fruit smoothie and add this in it and you won't get the bad after taste either

Is this tracking correct for kofta and egg gravy? I haven’t tracked this type of food before.. I weighed the meatballs. So they were for 35 gm each.. the roti tracking i didnt know what to use..
23/11/2024, 3:56 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
23/11/2024, 4:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'd just add 2tsp oil, the rest of it looks good!
23/11/2024, 4:02 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Ok great 😊 thanks
23/11/2024, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For the meatballs, I’d just use cooked chicken thigh instead of ikea meatballs. The ikea meatballs will have much lower protein.
23/11/2024, 4:53 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Ok got it
23/11/2024, 6:13 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: <Media omitted>
Does this mean 2 servings has 150 calories?
23/11/2024, 6:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): basically 1 serving=2 shami which is 150 calories

10g carrots
2tsp oil

23/11/2024, 8:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh tou estimate hi hoga. 

Probably 450-550 sounds reasonable.
23/11/2024, 8:43 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Just a dessert or light snacking at desi homes in winters especially.

23/11/2024, 9:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Have the donut with a protein shake (2 scoops) + some nuts (almonds, walnuts) <This message was edited>
23/11/2024, 9:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s almost like a full meal in terms of calories/macros (high protein, some carbs, and fats), and you won’t feel as “guilty” about having a donut as you usually might (though there’s really nothing to feel guilty about anyway)

Annd you’re welcome! 😉 <This message was edited>

23/11/2024, 10:09 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Which one would be a better option and could be used in a daily diet.
Cheddar or cottage cheese?
23/11/2024, 10:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both can be fine. 

Cheddar is higher in calories. 

Cottage cheese is lower and potentially more protein.
23/11/2024, 10:12 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: I asked I question on FB but don't know where's gone

Per serving 30 grams 
Cheedar is 100 cal and 6g protein whereas cottage is 70 cals and 8g protein

23/11/2024, 11:35 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Okay thanks 🙏🏽

24/11/2024, 2:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not accurate
24/11/2024, 2:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
24/11/2024, 2:08 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: So we shouldn’t get happy that i burnt 200 calories 😂
24/11/2024, 2:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You burnt some calories. Don’t need to focus on the number
24/11/2024, 2:10 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Oh no. I always stop elliptical when it reaches 200 calories
24/11/2024, 2:10 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I thought they are accurate
24/11/2024, 2:11 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: How many minutes is it recommended then and how much calories it burn for 15 and 20 minutes
24/11/2024, 2:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends from person to person
24/11/2024, 2:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Again don’t focus on the number too much

Sometimes when I get tired I don't do it at all. But I walk everywhere school groceries etc my smartwatch estimate to burn 500 to 600 calories a day. Is that inaccurate as well ?

24/11/2024, 2:29 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
Is the calorie estimation on this reliable? Also what would be the protein content be like? The patties are thin (100g I think) and usually not protruding out of the burger
24/11/2024, 2:29 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
24/11/2024, 2:33 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): protein around 55ish 
calories look fine too
24/11/2024, 2:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: 55ish inclusive of the bread cheese and bacon? 🤔
24/11/2024, 2:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yea 55-60 would be a fair estimate
24/11/2024, 3:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Where’s this from
24/11/2024, 3:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: A local burger joint called Foil burger

24/11/2024, 5:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d say 700-800 easily.
24/11/2024, 5:47 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: It could possibly be more right
24/11/2024, 5:47 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: ?

24/11/2024, 6:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How many calories does naan (Kulcha) have? I'm away and unable to measure it.
Estimated weight or calories to track pls?
24/11/2024, 6:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: What I like to do is quickly check the recipe on google to see the ingredients and then track one serving

It gives you a rough idea of the calories and macros!
24/11/2024, 6:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's easier to weigh lentils when they're raw and then track the portion you eat after cooking
24/11/2024, 6:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: Tracking cooked lentils will always be a guesstimate and won't be as accurate
24/11/2024, 6:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: Roti/Chapati (40-50g): ~100-120 kcal

Naan (Kulcha) (80-120g): ~220-360 kcal

Sheermaal (120-150g): ~300-400 kcal

Save this for the future! ^
24/11/2024, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Kulcha is around 100g, so I'd track 300 kcal
24/11/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Does roghni naan have similar calories per 100g? 🤔
24/11/2024, 6:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Thank you. 🙂
24/11/2024, 6:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's got oil added on it plus sesame seeds, so 50 60 more calories
24/11/2024, 7:00 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: What if sesame seeds are added on Kulcha?  
Then. 1tsp seasme seeds added?
24/11/2024, 7:03 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Agr main 1/2 kg raw lon
After cooking main apne liye 150g lon gi cooked 
Confusion hai abhi b

24/11/2024, 7:18 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Alright thanks
24/11/2024, 7:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I track all of them as lentils.

No need to overcomplicate it
24/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly what Ali said. Weight them after cooking. 


Track it as cooked lentils. Add 2-3 tsp of oil.
24/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fun fact: I once tracked a sheermal accurately. 

Took the measurements from a naan wala.
24/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It was 890 calories.
24/11/2024, 7:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I swear I’ve not had a sheermal since 😂
24/11/2024, 7:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha fml! How much did it weigh?? 😂
24/11/2024, 7:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then Taaftaan also has similar calories I am guessing
24/11/2024, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It wasn’t the weight. It’s the oil
24/11/2024, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Milk, sugar
24/11/2024, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes
24/11/2024, 7:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ThanGod i never liked sheermaal😄
24/11/2024, 7:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: The naan my dad brings is now 180g, but I’ve been tracking it as 120g because that’s what it weighed last time. No idea how or when they upped the dough to 180g! 😅
24/11/2024, 7:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: So not surprise to hear that Sheermal has 890 cals 😂
24/11/2024, 7:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And I’ve seen people devour more than one with quorma
24/11/2024, 7:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve done that too

25/11/2024, 1:37 am - Taha Ahmed: Usually, 1 sucralose tab = 1tsp sugar
25/11/2024, 1:37 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I have powdered

25/11/2024, 1:39 am - Taha Ahmed: That'd be toooo much
25/11/2024, 1:39 am - Taha Ahmed: Perhaps, a tiny pinch of sucralose?
Try it and see if you like it or not, and then add more

25/11/2024, 1:40 am - Taha Ahmed: And why do you feel that way? What's unhealthy about it in your opinion?
25/11/2024, 1:41 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Too much oil and it’s generally a more calorie dense food
25/11/2024, 1:42 am - Taha Ahmed: But isn’t that how most foods are? Especially *ghar ke khaanay* like biryani? <This message was edited>
25/11/2024, 1:43 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Yeah, it is, but idk why feel the same way with other calorie dense foods like pizza
25/11/2024, 1:45 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro let me make it simple for you 
no food in itself is healthy or unhealthy. You should focus on the bigger picture if the majority of your calories are coming from nutritionaly rich foods whole foods getting good micro and macro nutrients then 1 meal doesnt make much of a difference its absolutely fine.
25/11/2024, 1:51 am - Taha Ahmed: We’ve been taught by influencers and media to feel guilty about eating fried or calorie-dense foods, like they’re automatically bad for us. This mindset has led to a poor relationship with food because we’re constantly told what’s “good” or “bad” for our health.

Fried chicken, for example, isn’t inherently unhealthy. It has protein, fat, and carbs, just like fried eggs and bread. Sure, it might lack some vitamins and minerals, but you can get those from other foods.

When you start understanding what you’re eating and how it fits into your goals, your perspective on food changes. It takes time, but with the right knowledge, your relationship with food will improve, and making informed choices becomes easier.
25/11/2024, 1:52 am - Taha Ahmed: I have a thought experiment for you:

- If you eat one bite of fried chicken, around 50-70 calories, is it unhealthy?
- Now, think about a loaded salad filled with fruits, vegetables, and chicken, but drenched in vinaigrette (which is mostly oil). Would you call that healthy?

You can reflect on this yourself or share your thoughts in the group. I'd love to hear why you think the way you do and what your thought process is like!
25/11/2024, 1:52 am - Taha Ahmed: Ah I wish we did this on FB! 😋
25/11/2024, 1:53 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: We can take it on facebook, if it helps the community
25/11/2024, 1:54 am - Taha Ahmed: I’m sure it’ll help a lot!  
Many people feel the same way, and it’s important to recognize when these feelings or thoughts come up. And having the right tools and strategies in place can make a big difference in overcoming them
25/11/2024, 1:55 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Sure thing, i’ll make a post on facebook

25/11/2024, 1:12 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: No Vpn is working here in Lahore. Such a pathetic situation since Friday night.
25/11/2024, 1:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Even Cloudfare?
25/11/2024, 1:15 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Didn't tried it before. Let me try it.  🤞
25/11/2024, 1:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup, this one will work! 💪🏽
25/11/2024, 1:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its not working for me !!
25/11/2024, 3:13 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Go to settings and then choose 1.1.1.1 instead of WARP
25/11/2024, 3:13 pm - PF - Ali Haider: It worked for me
25/11/2024, 4:38 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Are there any glute workouts in the training guide? 
I think i saw that on sameet or tahas story
25/11/2024, 4:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, we're uploading them shortly 🙏🏽
25/11/2024, 5:01 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Also how many calories does a 500 g piece of pomfret have? 
And protein
25/11/2024, 5:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: About 1030 calories and ~90g protein
26/11/2024, 5:17 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Hi need some advice.. today i am feeling exceptionally hungry lol.. I am a little anxious today and usually do anxious eating.. and well i have used up my daily calories by 6pm by junk eating 🙈ate 2 chocolate chip cookies after lunch.. they were v high caloric.. what do you sugget to do under such circumstances
26/11/2024, 5:48 am - Taha Ahmed: If it’s just one day, let it go! One day won’t derail your progress. Eat something volumous - less calories and more nutrient dense - to curb your hunger rn.

But if it’s becoming a pattern (like you said you usually do anxious eating), then start by identifying the _why_ behind your anxious eating. When you feel the urge, pause and ask: _Am I truly hungry or just seeking comfort?_ Instead of reaching for high-calorie snacks all the time, try alternatives like calling a friend to talk about your anxiety, journaling your thoughts, or practicing deep breathing. (I know it's probably not the solution you're looking for here. And this requires a lot of self work!) 

Instead of cookies, opt for a handful of nuts as an example or a calming tea while reflecting on what’s driving your emotions.

From a psychological perspective, anxious eating often stems from unresolved feelings or a need for control. Recognizing this can help you approach your emotions differently, whether through mindfulness, creating a calming ritual, or seeking professional support if needed.
26/11/2024, 6:19 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: All of these make sense for this horrible anxious eating 😫😫😫 I know eventually its self control i needto develop and been realizing it more since I joined project fomo🤦🏻‍♀️🙈
26/11/2024, 11:58 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, developing self control is crucial, but you also need to figure the underlying issue of your anxieties and why you eta when you're anxious

Just self control won't help na

26/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's just an Arabic shawarma with chicken, and sauces, in it, typically the calories should be around ~450-600
26/11/2024, 7:26 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: I always regret having foods like these I mean they’re unhealthy because DHABAY ka shawarma are but I couldn’t resist 😭
26/11/2024, 7:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: It'd be unhealthy only if it had diesel in it or some rat poison (in that case it'd be toxic lol). There's nothing unhealthy in it! Haan unhygienic jagah se liya ho tou that's a diff story.
26/11/2024, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why are they unhealthy?
26/11/2024, 7:29 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Whenever I eat out I always exceed my calories. I probably doubt it’s because my protein goals never reaches( protein powder still isn’t here because of the protest) but I usually have carbs in morning so that’s why probably I’m more hungry these days? Also, I wanted to ask is it okay to do  2 day home workout in one day? ( I did previously)
26/11/2024, 7:30 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Always hearing people say eating outside is always unhealthy. Home cooked food is always healthy?
26/11/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: They blame “ all beemariya they’ve” is because they ate outside? Or blaming genetics? Eg: sugar?
26/11/2024, 7:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is something we recently addressed on Jaish's post on FB! Should I tag you on it?
26/11/2024, 7:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: And regarding the workout, why do you want to do 2 workouts in one day?
26/11/2024, 7:38 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Eating anything in excess is unhealthy that's wat I've learned so far <This message was edited>
26/11/2024, 7:39 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: No I saw it and even questioned. But I just wanted to know if this is true or not?( my mom doesn’t eat sugar, it’s very rare that I saw her eat something sweet aur wo bhi bohit Thora and she is diabetic that’s why I asked is it food that makes you diabetes or any other factors are also involved) Like if we’re eating out consecutively so you’re not having balanced meal?
26/11/2024, 7:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): thats exactly how it is 
bahar k khano ki hygiene is the issue genrly not the food itself.
26/11/2024, 7:40 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Because of my routine. Also, I skipped some days and I want to complete the workouts that’s why
26/11/2024, 7:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): eating excess calories for a long period of time coupled with minimal or no physical activity leads you to insulin resistance weight gain and all the associated issues like diabetes etc.
26/11/2024, 7:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Hygiene and quality of ingredients used 😂
26/11/2024, 7:45 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: ?

26/11/2024, 7:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): keep things simple 
if your routine is tough then sync. your workouts around your schedule n not the days of the week. it will help alot
26/11/2024, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s 200-220. 

The owner is a long term client so I have insights hahaha
26/11/2024, 7:50 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Oh wow it looks like it has 1k or 2k calories 🥲
26/11/2024, 7:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a mini donut lol
26/11/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I knowww but the filling looks scary calorie wise also I always have over estimated desserts as super high calorie food
26/11/2024, 7:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is chocolate covered donut. Filling wala can be 300ish
26/11/2024, 8:04 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Makes sense

26/11/2024, 9:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cause that looks like a lot of egg for 1
26/11/2024, 9:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: They literally fry the bun and kebabs in so much oil! A safe estimate would be 600-800! Could easily be more!
26/11/2024, 9:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s one egg and one shami then do 600ish.

so 600ish for normal anda shami
26/11/2024, 9:24 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I think it's one. Max. one and half. But mostly it's one.

26/11/2024, 10:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Keep it up! Your consistency is paying off, and you're proving that slow and steady truly wins the race.
26/11/2024, 10:12 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Should I track cooked dal as lentil or lentil soup?
26/11/2024, 10:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Lentils cooked
27/11/2024, 12:26 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Dahi ballay kese track krein? Homemade

Made the smallest difference of bringing these with me to have midst chaotic day instead of not having any snacks or lunch at all and it made the biggest difference in my energy level
Sometimes you really stop taking care of yourself as an adult like what stopped me before?? 
Probably not having coaches to advise good habits and knock common sense 🫣
27/11/2024, 1:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: We all fall short sometimes, even us coaches, haha! 🫠
Knowing what to do doesn't mean we're always doing it right.  
We slip up too, but we've mastered the art of cutting ourselves some slack and moving forward, no matter what.  
It’s all about troubleshooting as we go, a skill honed through years of practice and experience.
But since it's a skill, you can learn that too.
27/11/2024, 1:08 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Gosh I wish I could write this well 
Sir when are you writting a book?
27/11/2024, 1:09 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: True that
I hope I can keep up  and make it a habit 😩
27/11/2024, 1:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha, you know, I’ve actually been thinking about that for a while now. Funny enough, I even got a publishing deal a few months ago to write about my experiences and how I navigate life and life's hardships with so much grace. But honestly, I just don’t feel like I have the patience to sit down and write a whole book just yet. Maybe soon, though... who knows! 🤷🏽‍♂
27/11/2024, 1:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: You’re already doing it! 
See, progress ebbs and flows, just like daily weight fluctuations. 
Some days you’ll feel amazing, and other days, not so much. 
Just hang in there, stay as consistent as you can, and you’ll get through it just fine.
And soon it'll become a part of you and your routine.

27/11/2024, 1:47 pm - PF - Izma Arshad: yes 🙌🏼
27/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: It should have a nutrition label on the back of the pack

If it doesn't, then use this:
100g cottage cheese
Calories: 95-105
Protein: 10-11g
27/11/2024, 1:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Just use a cottage cheese entry 

I think there is one with a green tick

27/11/2024, 3:22 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @60193244266 1 slice
27/11/2024, 3:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Slice size matters. But probably 500-600
27/11/2024, 3:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hmm... that's a lot of fat and protein to have in a 100g of cottage cheese
27/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Even I bought a block of this but it was nightmare, for me, to use this.

Then I moved to cheddar as it was already sliced and easy to use.
Not much difference in calories and macros

27/11/2024, 4:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: Cottage cheese is usually low in fat and kinda high in protein
27/11/2024, 4:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it's mostly carbs and fats, that's why!
27/11/2024, 4:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: half of everything?

27/11/2024, 5:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t need to rely on estimations when you’ve weighed everything. 

Remember we too can be way off with our estimates. So, weighing and tracking is the more accurate way.
27/11/2024, 5:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just account for an extra 1.5tsp oil for them
27/11/2024, 5:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rice will probably be 75g-100g cooked

29/11/2024, 9:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>

29/11/2024, 9:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): How much oil did you use in making ?
29/11/2024, 9:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): normal medium shami would be ~90calories approx. 
add oil accordingly
29/11/2024, 9:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Mother fried all for dinner. So I dont estimation.
29/11/2024, 9:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: After adding oil 140-150 calories are fine. Right?

It's chop chop wok's super bowl <This message was edited>
30/11/2024, 2:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It looks so oily
30/11/2024, 2:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Or is it just me
30/11/2024, 2:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Very oily, plus had honey, peanuts, sesame seeds, etc.
30/11/2024, 2:35 pm - PF - Ali Haider: So how many calories are there exactly in this?
30/11/2024, 3:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'll answer in a few hours 🤣 let others vote abhi
30/11/2024, 6:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay so this super beef rice bowl has around 700-750 calories (I couldn't know how much peanut was in there so overestimating that a bit)
30/11/2024, 6:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I marked 650-700 but withdrew 650 after seeing this
30/11/2024, 6:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Very good estimates tbh!
30/11/2024, 6:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm the winner
30/11/2024, 7:00 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: As you overestimate mine. I overestimated yours.
30/11/2024, 7:00 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: The only difference is..you're probably not having a heart attack....
30/11/2024, 7:00 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: And how much protein?
30/11/2024, 7:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Around 35g (it had 100g of cooked beef, so probably 125-130g raw)
30/11/2024, 7:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha! I also had sushi with it, so the overall intake was around 1600ish calories with about 65-70g of protein 😄
30/11/2024, 7:23 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: One meal. 😂
30/11/2024, 7:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha, my portions are big, that's why! I'm eating around 2700-3000 calories these days 😄

That's my maintenance^ 🤭 <This message was edited>
30/11/2024, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I win 🥇
30/11/2024, 7:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Great.

But I have observed that in 1500-1600 calories, a person like me can only take 60-65g protein from food. 100g tak janay k liye whey protein leni perti.
30/11/2024, 7:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: I could easily hit 100g of protein in 1600 calories. Since I have a bigger calorie allowance, I include more calorie-dense foods and usually end up hitting around 150-160g of protein daily

That said, I know it’s not easy, especially with how our desi foods and diets are typically prepared. It takes a lot of effort to incorporate high-protein options into desi meals while staying mindful of your choices <This message was edited>
30/11/2024, 7:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): my estimate was 700 too !!
30/11/2024, 7:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: And I am not taking whey protein at all!
30/11/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I can't beat you abhi tou 😂
Well it's going good so far. But yes, I'm enjoying food.😝
30/11/2024, 7:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: My usual food intake includes 500-600gm chicken breast, 3-4 eggs, 250ish ml milk, 30g cheese everyday

That gives me about 150-165gm of protein <This message was edited>
30/11/2024, 7:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Zayda Sara hicken Khana is very tough. 🙊
30/11/2024, 7:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha true, when you have two double patty burgers, 1 tikka, you don't even feel it
30/11/2024, 7:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you eat boiled/grilled chicken then yes, it feels like you're chewing rubber all day
30/11/2024, 7:34 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Maaf kerain 😂
I can't eat these boiled things at all. Being Lahori. Never 😂
30/11/2024, 7:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m eating 1800 these days and hitting 165g of protein
30/11/2024, 7:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Tips tips please. Should I make this as FB post. It would be helpful for all I guess.
30/11/2024, 7:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s just that we’re never taught to include protein rich foods in our diets
30/11/2024, 7:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah sure
30/11/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Like a tikka, naan and chutney is easily 50-60g protein in 500ish calories
30/11/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Similarly I make desi foods at home
30/11/2024, 8:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): my intake for the day until now is 1560 calories with 150g protein 
so you can easily hit protein within 1500-1600
30/11/2024, 8:01 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly. That's the point.
30/11/2024, 8:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How naan?
30/11/2024, 8:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Can I ask why you have 3000 calories .. are you bulking ?
30/11/2024, 8:15 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Please do share your tips
30/11/2024, 8:15 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: I can do 140g protein but in 1800 calories
30/11/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i mostly keep my protein sources staple which makes it easier for me 

3 whole eggs ~18g protein 210-215calories
500ml full fat milk ~15g protein 300 calories
300g chicken breast airfried ~85-90g protein 500 calories 
1 scoop whey ~22-23g protein 120 calories
Approx. 1150 calories for 140g protein 

Baki jitni bhi calories remaining hon unko ma carbs n fats sy ly leta hun. Simple
30/11/2024, 8:30 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Kuch protein aapko carb sources sy bhi mil jaegi which makes my daily protein intake at around 155-160g 
i'm keeping my protein approx. 2g per Kg of my body weight. i'm weighing 75kgs at the moment 
I hope it all makes sense
30/11/2024, 8:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Full fat milk has a lot of fat. Sometimes increasing protein can increase fat.
30/11/2024, 8:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can use low fat milk
30/11/2024, 8:40 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if u are taking like 3 eggs then u can have 1 whole & 2 whites us sy bhi fat intake km hojaegi
30/11/2024, 8:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will add my sources as well. 


1 can of tuna has 32gram of protein 142 calories 

Fat free cottage cheese 100g has 10 g protein 68 calories 

Salmon 100g 26g protein 156 calories 

Babybel light 1 serving 6g protein 47 calories.
30/11/2024, 8:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes I make 2 eggs and 8 tablespoon of egg whites
30/11/2024, 8:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this is 74g protein & 413 total calories
you can easily manage another 40-45g protein with like 150g chicken breast (~250 calories) yet you will have enough calories to distribute among carbs n fats
30/11/2024, 8:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I just added some to yours . I take more from other sources
30/11/2024, 8:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes that totally makes sense 
what matters is that you are hitting your daily protein intake mark
30/11/2024, 9:37 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923441183411 my Dymatize cookies and cream protein powder arrived day before yesterday. I tried it with milk and I love it 😍 tastes wonderful, dissolves easy and no gagging issues. I was quite afraid initially as I had purchased the 5 lbs tub due to sales period. Thank you for telling me about it earlier 🙏🏼
30/11/2024, 9:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Thats amazing brother. So good to know

01/12/2024, 12:35 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: 2 of these
01/12/2024, 12:38 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That looks like total 40g of Nutella. And add 2 crepes worth 150 calories each. 

I’m assuming they had sugar and oil was used
01/12/2024, 12:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That includes coffee. Maybe just increase Nutella to 1.5

Did you make this at home?
01/12/2024, 12:40 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
I had halwa puri fir bfast. Is this tracking ok or should I add more oil

01/12/2024, 12:47 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Yes
01/12/2024, 12:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why didn’t you track it waisay? Like weigh it out?
01/12/2024, 12:49 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Is it ok if i go over the fat target for the day? I am 9 over far and have around 500 calories left. Will try and have more protein though
01/12/2024, 12:52 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I made a big batch of batter for the family.. couldn’t understand what and how to measure..
01/12/2024, 12:52 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Lol 22 over fat target. 4 tbsp of oil is 54 fat and 477 cal…dead!
01/12/2024, 12:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you had 1 puri then 3 tbsp oil is fine 
and if you are within your caloric limits protein target meet horaha then its not an issue agar fat intake zada hogae ho
01/12/2024, 12:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nutella karletay. 

Chalo next time
01/12/2024, 12:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Now you know why our food is so high in calories. 

Oil in the dish and then oil for tarka too 🤣
01/12/2024, 12:59 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also weigh out the entire batter and just divide into portions. 

If you made 10 crepes and you had 2. Then you had 20% of all ingredients. 

This makes it easier to track when cooking in bulk.
01/12/2024, 1:05 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Nutella i measured as 1 tbsp but maybe could be more.. and no sugar was added to the batter..
The oil i used for myself for each crepe was 1 tsp on a nonstick pan.. so ensured about those..
01/12/2024, 1:06 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Next time i am thinking make my batter seperately atleast for now
01/12/2024, 1:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can but you can also make life easier with the trick I mentioned
01/12/2024, 1:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Btw remember 1tbsp can be 16g or 45g. Depending on how full the tbsp isis
01/12/2024, 1:34 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Got it definitely.. 👍🏽
01/12/2024, 2:39 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: How should steamed leg/thigh (1/4 chicken) be tracked? I marinated it in tikka masala, lemon and ginger garlic then cooked in its own water.
01/12/2024, 3:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cooked chicken thigh
01/12/2024, 3:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or if it’s like a leg tikka, you can just add 200 raw chicken thigh

Add oil as used

01/12/2024, 5:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): scale is showing 188g in total so if you look at the quantity, chickpeas zada nhi hain  so rice would be around 160 n bki chickpeas
01/12/2024, 5:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): hahaha
01/12/2024, 5:04 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I hate how much calories oil takes up 
Wish there was a way to cook everything without it
01/12/2024, 5:05 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Though I have air fryer and I cook most things in it. Rice and omelette and some things can’t be made in it🥲🥲🥲

How do I calculate calories per chocolate square?
01/12/2024, 5:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): measure the sqaure, how much it weighs 
there are 527 calories per 100g so lets suppose it weighs  10g then 52-53 calories in it
01/12/2024, 5:45 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Full chocolate has 2204 calories? Out so can’t measure it
01/12/2024, 5:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): It 2207Kj & 527kcal (calories)
we always measure in Kcal (calories). Kj is the smaller unit. There are 0.239 calories in 1kj
01/12/2024, 5:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): jitna chunk lena hai usko kitchen scale py measure krlena
01/12/2024, 5:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): n you will get to know the calories
01/12/2024, 5:47 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Okay
01/12/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk
01/12/2024, 6:22 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Check the net weight mentioned on the packing for better estimate
01/12/2024, 6:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Like Ali mentioned, we use 'kilocalories' (kcal) as a unit of energy, which is the same as a Calorie (basically kcal).

1 kcal = 4.18 kJ

Most countries use kcal, and we stick with it because it makes tracking, measurement, and calculations much easier.

When you check food labels, you’ll usually see both kJ and kcal listed. Focus on the kcal - it’s the one we commonly use!
01/12/2024, 6:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can see per 36g serving, there are 188 calories in it

If there are 10 pieces/squares of chocolate, that means 1 piece = 3.6g, that means 18.8 kcal

Hi 👋… how can i measure the calories for this dates ball inciting all kind of seeds
01/12/2024, 7:55 pm - PF - Parishy Noor: I just make them for my sweet craving 🙊
01/12/2024, 8:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Let me make this simple and I'll add this as a separate post on Facebook (can help many of you)

To accurately track homemade energy balls in a food diary (or any homemade recipe), start by logging each ingredient separately in your app, I know MFP allows for it and I am sure MacrosFirst also has the option. Enter the quantities of all ingredients used, for example, 500g of dates, 200g of peanut butter, and 150g of honey, 150g of seeds, etc., and save this as a recipe named “Energy Balls" or whatever you want. This will create a consolidated nutritional profile for the entire batch. 

**It's important to measure everything accurately to ensure the macros and calorie count are as precise as possible.

Once the mixture is prepared, weigh the total batch (e.g., it might weigh 1kg or 1000g). Divide the batch into equal-sized portions, such as 20 balls, and weigh one to determine the average weight per ball (e.g., 50g). 

Now in your app, set the recipe to yield 20 servings. When you eat one ball, you can log it as one serving. If you eat a larger or smaller ball, adjust the serving size accordingly. For instance, a 40g ball could be logged as 0.8 servings, while a 60g ball would count as 1.2 servings.

If you create the recipe once, you save time and effort for future tracking (it becomes so much easier). The next time you make something like this, you can reuse the same recipe. Even if the total batch weight or portion sizes change slightly, the method remains the same pretty much, you might just need to update the total weight and serving size. 

I love this approach because it makes your tracking consistent without added hassle.

I might have more tips that I could share, let me know if this one was helpful. 🙏🏽 <This message was edited>

Is this the right entry for milk (not the packet one - but home dairy animals) ??
01/12/2024, 8:25 pm - PF - Parishy Noor: Thanku will do that next time😀
01/12/2024, 8:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good! The difference isn’t that significant unless you’re using condensed milk!
01/12/2024, 8:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It would be very helpful. It Should be a FB post.

01/12/2024, 11:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ve been tracking so what do you think th me estimate should be?
01/12/2024, 11:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Rice: cooked 170-180g
Peas cooked: 60g - guess
Oil: 1tsp

Crumble chicken cooked: 100-120g
Oil: 1-1.5 tbsp

For patatos kabab:
Boiled potatoes: 55-60gm

🤞😁 <This message was edited>
02/12/2024, 12:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rice looks fine but I’d use 2tsp oil. 

Chicken is 80-90g
Oil 2tsp

Rest is good. Kebab not fried in oil?
02/12/2024, 12:08 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I have no idea. Khala bought them frozen packed I guess. 
Fried hon ge ( GTG dinner so 🙊)
02/12/2024, 12:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Add a tsp of oil for that too then

02/12/2024, 12:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's smart. You can do that!

You can also do 6 kfc hotshots, add 2tsp sesame seeds, 2tsp honey (if there was any cause it seems like it)
02/12/2024, 12:48 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): No honey its food colour
02/12/2024, 12:48 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
These were the ingredients
02/12/2024, 12:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: it's homemade?
02/12/2024, 12:49 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): No

02/12/2024, 12:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ah, got it. Thanks for clarifying! 

I mentioned honey because the sesame seeds seemed to stick to the chicken really well, and honey is often used for that. But if it’s not, tracking as KFC hot shots plus sesame seeds works perfectly!

Are the ones written on the box for everything included or just the stir fry mix
02/12/2024, 3:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Is it just masala/flavor or what?

cause the packet's net weight is 35g
The label is for 136g (not sure if it's just the mix's weight or prepared stir fried) <This message was edited>
02/12/2024, 3:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think it includes everything. But for 135g
02/12/2024, 3:57 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Just masala ka packrt hai 
We’re supposed to add soya sauce and oil etc
02/12/2024, 3:57 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Masala ingredients
02/12/2024, 4:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: The label is very confusing lol

Anyway, seems like the calories are for 4 of those packs mixed together (136g)
so I'd divide everything by 4 to get a more accurate calorie and macro count
kcal: 41
fat: 0.15g
carbs: 0.9g
pro: 1.6g

and then track everything else you add (esp oil, meat etc) <This message was edited>

02/12/2024, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just the thin wrapper but it’s likely 5-6g. 

I record it as 100 just to be safe. <This message was edited>
02/12/2024, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1tbsp is around 15g

02/12/2024, 11:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's about 104 gram in total
02/12/2024, 11:36 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But how do I break it . As it has keema too
02/12/2024, 11:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Which entry to made for garbanzo beans in n App?

Boiled or cooked. I'm confused. Pls guide. <This message was edited>

Really guilty for not including fruits and veggies and healthy snacks. Had hectic day and was really hungry so I ate two of these. This had very less chicken( na honay ke barabar) and little veggies. But was very oily. Had two of these.Calories around in each roll?

Also, how do I calculate the calories of Meethay chawal?
03/12/2024, 12:04 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I couldn't find any entry for orzo so I tracked it as cooked pasta
03/12/2024, 12:04 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
03/12/2024, 12:05 am - Taha Ahmed: I think "cooked" and "boiled" are pretty much going to be the same in terms of nutritional values or calories, unless there's a lot of oil added (which you can always track separately)
03/12/2024, 12:08 am - Taha Ahmed: It's a fried spring roll, so just add that?
It's probably around 130-160ish calories / per spring roll (cause it's deep fried)
03/12/2024, 12:09 am - Taha Ahmed: And no need to feel guilty honestly, it's just one day, it's not like your intake is like this every day. So take it easy.
03/12/2024, 12:09 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Is this right?
03/12/2024, 12:09 am - Taha Ahmed: Wait, I think I did this once before in this group
03/12/2024, 12:10 am - Taha Ahmed: here^
03/12/2024, 12:11 am - Taha Ahmed: This definitely has more jaggery and oil in it (shaadi/baahir ke gurr walay chawal are like that)
03/12/2024, 12:12 am - Taha Ahmed: That's totally acceptable. If a particular food isn't available, you can always find the closest alternative to track it, following our philosophy of keeping things simple and stress-free!
03/12/2024, 12:14 am - Taha Ahmed: Here's an accurate entry for Garbanzo Beans shared by Coach Ali before
03/12/2024, 12:14 am - Taha Ahmed: 100g has around 160+ calories
03/12/2024, 12:15 am - Taha Ahmed: Also, this looks like atleast ~150g, so break it down like this:
110g rice
30g jaggery
2tsp oil or 10g oil <This message was edited>
03/12/2024, 12:19 am - PF - Asma Tariq: But every green tick option in App of garbanzo beans is giving below 100 calories for 100g. 

Confused 😕
03/12/2024, 12:23 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Oper se aaj after 10 days consistency, I consumed 135 extra calories than target. 🙊😝
03/12/2024, 12:28 am - Taha Ahmed: When tracking foods in apps, it’s important to remember that nutritional entries can vary widely depending on user input and preparation methods (e.g., raw, boiled, or cooked with oil, etc.).

In general, boiled garbanzo beans typically have around 160-170 calories per 100 grams, while raw or canned options may differ due to added liquids. If you're seeing entries significantly below this range, it’s likely due to incorrect input or a misunderstanding of preparation methods in the app's nutritional database and that's something completely out of our hands, so... 

When in doubt I prefer overestimating slightly and it can be helpful, especially when you're focusing on weight loss or calorie accuracy. It’s also worth double-checking with a reliable source like USDA data to align your tracking with your goals. (you don't have to right now, but just sharing that)

But overall, consistency in how you log and a slight margin for error will ensure you stay on track without getting overly bogged down by minor discrepancies, those will exist and continue to haunt us forever, lol.
03/12/2024, 12:29 am - Taha Ahmed: 135 extra calories are nothing-don’t stress! 
Think of it as a way to thank your body for all the amazing things it does! 😊
03/12/2024, 12:29 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: if I'm confused at an entry i generally Google the calories and pick an entry closest to that range. is that okay?
03/12/2024, 12:30 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it is okay. Google also picks up data from USDA food database. Most apps use the same datasets to provide us nutritional values of MOST GENERIC foods . <This message was edited>
03/12/2024, 12:30 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: that's such a nice thing to say
03/12/2024, 12:32 am - Taha Ahmed: We're often too harsh on ourselves. We've got to change that now that you're a part of this community. <This message was edited>

03/12/2024, 1:36 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: That we make for pasta

Estimated weight for this single Palmiers? 
I think I'm calling it's name right.
03/12/2024, 7:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, Palmier is correct
And I think this one's around 25-30g, and should have 140-165 kcal

How to calculate calories in this one 
Its marinated with grma flour and lahori fish masala
03/12/2024, 7:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’d start by weighing the fish first, then measure the coating (flour used) and the oil used for cooking
03/12/2024, 7:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you make this? If so, did you weigh anything? <This message was edited>
03/12/2024, 7:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It was 14-16 (grams).
*Bought new one from the same place, and weighted myself.
03/12/2024, 7:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Got it! So around 70-80 kcal <This message was edited>

03/12/2024, 7:56 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: which is right?
03/12/2024, 7:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: this one (It's also got a green tick next to it, which means it's verified) <This message was edited>
03/12/2024, 7:56 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: No i didnt made this
It was marinated already 
I only know the ingredients
03/12/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: can i use it for all the chicken i eat? even if its not breast specifically?
03/12/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: It is 300 grams cooked
03/12/2024, 7:58 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: And it has bones so will measure bones and will let you know the actual weight of this fish
03/12/2024, 7:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: you can if you want to, but keep in mind that if you're eating something like chicken thighs, this entry won’t account for the extra fat they have (since thigh pieces contain more fat). so, the numbers could be a bit off.

similarly, chicken breast has the most protein, but if you use this entry to track chicken wings, it won’t be accurate - even if the weight is the same.
03/12/2024, 8:01 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: For any kind of meat, we need to specify the part of it as well? Right?
03/12/2024, 8:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: 300g also has oil and batter included in it, hmm!

Fish raw with bones: 280g
Gram flour: 30g
Oil: 2tsp
03/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I sprayed olive oil 2 sprays
03/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: To me 2 tsp hi ad krun?
03/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Add*
03/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Ya 1 tsp krlun?
03/12/2024, 8:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: yes, add 1tsp atleast
03/12/2024, 8:04 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Ok
03/12/2024, 8:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: To keep it simple, you can choose the easiest entry. However, for better accuracy, it's best to select the specific parts, as calories and macros can vary quite a bit
03/12/2024, 8:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Got it! Thanks!
03/12/2024, 8:10 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I had 1 piece

03/12/2024, 8:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you didn't weigh the fish then yes, for simplicity, this works
03/12/2024, 8:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: But you don't know how much that 1 piece is
03/12/2024, 8:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: It could be 20g or 200g
03/12/2024, 8:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: How much did one piece weigh? Choose raw rohu fish and track that
03/12/2024, 8:15 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Wo option nh show ho rhi
03/12/2024, 8:15 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Mene cooked measure ki hai 150g one piece tha with bones

Can someone help me figure out calories for these fried kababs. Each kabab weighs around 50g, ingredients include chicken and cheese.
03/12/2024, 10:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think he meant ke jo recipe aapne banayi hai, uske full batch mai calories aur macros (protein, fats, carbs) kitnay hain?
03/12/2024, 10:21 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: 2198 calories 
Protein 65g
Fats 58g 
Carbs 167 g
03/12/2024, 10:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Tricky, but I'll try guesstimating it; let's say it's got 25g chicken, 10g cheese, 10g perth, 5g crumbs (total 50g)

that'd be around ~140-170 calories (without the oil used for cooking)
03/12/2024, 10:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 26 servings from the whole batch ?
03/12/2024, 10:33 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): macros ma kuch issue lg raha hai 
240g chicken breast & 9 whole eggs alone will be around ~120-125g protein
03/12/2024, 10:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I wanted to confirm does 100g of cooked roti has 300 calories ?
03/12/2024, 10:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 250ish

Had about 250g of chicken tikka. Is this entry fine or should i go with direct available entries of chicken tikka?
03/12/2024, 11:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: The kababs are typically dipped in beaten egg (or sometimes a batter of egg and flour), which helps create a sticky layer. It's hard to track that lol so I just use perth to track which is a samosa patti/dough/wrap to make samosas (same ingredients)
03/12/2024, 11:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: Depends. If they are deep fried then atleast 2-3tsp oil (looks quite oily in the picture)

*From University cafe so can't weight it.
04/12/2024, 1:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 400ish. 10g protein
04/12/2024, 2:11 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 400 😨

04/12/2024, 2:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahha. 

Easiest is to find a Chana chat entry and add 250ish of it. 

No need to overcomplicate it. 

Otherwise. You can break it down to boiled garbanzo beans, yoghurt and potatoes

oil - 3-4tsp
04/12/2024, 2:41 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Thankyou! Also wanted to ask 1 slice of layers cake has around 500 calories?
04/12/2024, 2:42 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Since the slice size can vary so should I measure it before having it? ( yesterday couldn’t resist and I ate it  more than I should and didn’t track aswell)
04/12/2024, 2:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: No clue haha, depends on the kind of cake and the size/portion of it
04/12/2024, 2:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just take the standard entry and track that
04/12/2024, 2:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: I like to overestimate a little in these situations so even if I ate more, I track a bit more than that so that I stay under my calorie target (esp when I am cutting/losing fat)
04/12/2024, 2:48 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Milky malt. Yes but I ate a lot 😭😭( is it a good idea to just have 2 3 tbsp? Because they’re too yum that I lose control ☹️
04/12/2024, 3:06 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: ?
04/12/2024, 3:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): mutton masala measure nhi kia tha ?

04/12/2024, 7:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Honestly, if you add a picture of what your plate looked like along with MFP diary screenshot, it’d make it much easier to guesstimate your portions, food entries, and calories
04/12/2024, 11:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Hi 
Is there any nutritional difference between basmati and sella rice. 

Sella rice usually used for biryani .
04/12/2024, 11:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
05/12/2024, 12:15 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
This entry is right for three chicken seekh kabab weighted 222g?

Plus I added 1tsp oil - although it was supposed that no oil has been used. 🤷🏻‍♀️

05/12/2024, 12:20 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: 1 bagel with very light jam.. not even half tsp.. 3boiled eggs with cottage cheese reduced fat.. 1/4th avacado and some sauce and coffee with almond milk
05/12/2024, 12:20 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Is this looking /sounding correct with the app?
05/12/2024, 12:22 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I had this as brunch around 12:30.. as my first meal.. and i will be out and about all day..
05/12/2024, 12:22 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): seekh kebab ki making ma kuch ingredients or bhi use hoty hain as far as i know. I dont know if you made it with chicken only 
If its chicken only then entry theek hai but if u used other ingredients like onions or some other veggies then 25-30g usko minus kr k 190-195g chicken breast log krlo aap
05/12/2024, 12:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks good
05/12/2024, 12:24 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Not home made. 

I should add 200g for safe side. What you say?
05/12/2024, 12:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 
200 would be fine plus the oil u used
05/12/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Not home cooked even. So I added 1tsp oil for the safe side. Theek hai?
05/12/2024, 12:30 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes !!

I scanned the label for this..not the first time there is discrepancy in the label and barcode scan. Slight difference but which one should we track by if this happens. The higher one?
05/12/2024, 4:13 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: The one on the label. You can always create an entry for it and then use that every time
05/12/2024, 5:16 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
Which would be more accurate. 2nd one says it’s meat only.
05/12/2024, 6:40 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For what?
05/12/2024, 6:41 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I had 1/4 chicken (thigh + leg) so was windering which is more accurate from the 2 above
05/12/2024, 6:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken thigh 200g 
Plus oil. 

I’m assuming it was a tikka type
05/12/2024, 6:42 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Yes. No oil..thanks

How many calories does this look like? It's a tehzeeb's smallest fruit salad bowl
05/12/2024, 2:21 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I had only 3 teaspoons
05/12/2024, 2:22 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @60193244266 @923343773307
05/12/2024, 2:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not sure about this, but I'd just use "Nestle Fruit Yogurt" entry on MFP and track that
05/12/2024, 2:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: This looks like it has a lot of cream too
05/12/2024, 2:24 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: You are correct....lots of cream
05/12/2024, 2:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha then just track Fresh Cream - 2tsp and 1tsp sugar
05/12/2024, 2:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh 2tbsp say zaada hi hai. Maybe @923441183411 has an idea since he’s from Islamabad
05/12/2024, 2:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha it's probably got more 5 tbsp, but she ate only 3 teaspoons

05/12/2024, 2:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can have it and @923441183411 can tell you how many calories it's got then - cause it's full of fresh cream and sugar (which means higher fat content and loads of calories for no reason)
05/12/2024, 2:41 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: the reason is happiness :D
05/12/2024, 2:41 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: JK....I was having it with my food atcually... so consumed a little !
05/12/2024, 2:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha I am glad you said that! 😂

If I calculate my consumed calories for this week till Saturday, it's 360 more than targeted. 
I always try to consume less calories per week purposely, to adjust estimations.  

Weekly protein intake was Average 84g so far - target was 100g.

Should I do fasting tomorrow and have a one enriched meal? Or just 500 cal kaam le lon. Any guide. <This message was edited>
08/12/2024, 12:39 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You dont have to worry about anything its such a minor details. 
If you are lets say creating a deficit of 500 calories daily n 3500 weekly then overall weekly deficit just 3500 sy 3140 py agya hai n overal 1lb ki jgah ub 0.9lb fat drop hoga 
i hope it makes sense
08/12/2024, 12:48 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yup got it. Thanks 😊

08/12/2024, 7:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha, that’s honestly a solid way to eat out! Funny enough, this was one of the first habits I started working on back in 2009 when I got into fitness. It took me a good 5-6 years to fully embrace the mindset of choosing high-protein options when eating out lol! Also had no one to guide me so probably why it took longer

It’s such a game-changer because, even if I’m not hitting all my targets, at least I’m nailing the protein one and if I go a bit overboard on calories, I know I’ve still made a solid choice! 😊
08/12/2024, 7:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Was it your birthday as well? 🤔

Is this the right entry in the App for macros point of you?

Nurpur cheese is not available with green ticks, Therefore I thought I should ask.
08/12/2024, 8:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent
08/12/2024, 8:18 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah on 5th 😂
08/12/2024, 8:19 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Mine was on 5th too 😱
08/12/2024, 8:20 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Happy birthday 🎂 birthday twin
08/12/2024, 8:20 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Happy belated birthday @447360154390 !
08/12/2024, 8:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: @447360154390 @923475239954 happy belated birthday to both of you!
08/12/2024, 8:25 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Thanks coach
08/12/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: and now birthday reminded me that I wanted to ask that how can I know the calories in 100 g Naan and 189 g Chicken Qeema+Aaloo+Matter <This message was edited>
08/12/2024, 9:15 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad joined from the community
08/12/2024, 9:17 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Hi, is there a particular nutrition calculator our community can use to help track and adjust our macro recommendations based on stuff like weight?
08/12/2024, 9:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: You cna break it down and add in MFP/MacrosFirst app

1 naan / 100g naan
80g keema
50g boiled potato
20g peas
1-2tsp oil
08/12/2024, 9:25 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: And should I choose Qeema , Aaloo mattar cooked?
08/12/2024, 9:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can use any calculator and it's going to give you a baseline number

Then you start tracking your food intake and bodyweight/body girth measurements to see whether you're making progress or not whether it's fat loss or muscle gain and adjust accordingly 

If you're training for performance specific sports then considerations for adjustments would be different 

For protein, the daily recommendation is 1.6g-2.2g of protein per kg of your bodyweight (it depends which side of the range you lean on depending on your goals, performance etc)
08/12/2024, 9:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can do either since we're guesstimating without actually seeing the portion size

80 g cooked or 100g raw mince beef
08/12/2024, 9:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: We break it down for more accuracy but if you just want to track and move on without much fuss then you can do "189g aalo qeems" entry as well
08/12/2024, 9:29 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
is this a correct entry for bhindi?
08/12/2024, 9:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: For raw okra, yes!
08/12/2024, 9:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: But the way we make it at homes has 5 times more calories due to added oil
08/12/2024, 9:31 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Yes I did find a aloo qeema one but it wasn’t green ticked so was wondering what would be the best course
08/12/2024, 9:31 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: I'll add that separate yes
08/12/2024, 9:32 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Do spices have added calories ?
08/12/2024, 9:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's a desi dish and everyone makes this recipe differently so there's no way to tell if they all have the same calories/macors (why it can't be verified)
08/12/2024, 9:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: No
08/12/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Thanks coach, basically I'm training for a marathon over the next year but I don't want to compromise my strength either. What training/nutrition plan do you recommend? Before joining yall i was doing calisthenics exercises for legs with the goal of doing pistol squats
08/12/2024, 10:03 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Do i have to add calories for vegetables like cucumber and carrots too?
08/12/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No not really 
Han agar aap koe 200g 300g use kr rhi ek ek vege then count else like 40 50 ko na b track kren to masla nhi
08/12/2024, 10:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s the main goal at the moment? 

If you make a post, I can cover this in detail and give you options.
08/12/2024, 10:29 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Done
08/12/2024, 11:17 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Happy belated birthday 🎂.
09/12/2024, 12:05 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you 😊
09/12/2024, 2:03 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Happy birthday @923475239954 @447360154390 @447723402200
09/12/2024, 2:04 am - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Thank you so much Sadia 🫶🏼
09/12/2024, 2:06 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Is it ok not to care abt the macros one day a week but keep within calorie target? Does it matter if the weekly average gets messed up because of this? 
I’m on my period and I just don’t want to have any protein today! 
Sirf fries aur choc milkshake chahiye 👀
09/12/2024, 2:08 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Actually fried protein will do well 😬
09/12/2024, 2:13 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha yeah one day doesn’t make a big difference
09/12/2024, 2:17 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you
09/12/2024, 2:47 am - PF - Marium Hamza: Should we have more/ less calories if we’re more active or not? 

Like for me, I don’t workout on Sundays and my step count is also pretty low. 
But somedays I have strength training and running both on same day. 

So I should still keep same calories average throughout the week?
09/12/2024, 2:48 am - Taha Ahmed: There are many ways to do it, but the simplest is to keep your calorie intake the same throughout the week - no need to overcomplicate things!
09/12/2024, 2:49 am - Taha Ahmed: You could also reduce your calorie intake slightly on non-training days and eat a bit more on training days, as long as the overall weekly average stays the same
09/12/2024, 4:18 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
I had 1/2 of a smash burger and 82g of fries. They were not machine cut like McD’s though. Would that make a difference in macros? Is the tracking ok?
09/12/2024, 5:27 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I had messaged the place to ask abt calories: 
*Our  burgers have approximately 500-600 calories, and our Fries come in at around 300 calories.*
So I’ve sort of overtracked but seems about right.
The choc milk shake was about 400 that’s what the lady said.
09/12/2024, 8:38 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes looks fine
09/12/2024, 10:50 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Estimated calories?
09/12/2024, 10:51 am - Taha Ahmed: What is it?
09/12/2024, 10:51 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Cheese cake
09/12/2024, 10:52 am - Taha Ahmed: typically ~300-400 calories

09/12/2024, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Half of zinger burger
1 slice large pizza but
0.25 small fires of McDonald’s
09/12/2024, 5:22 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk

mushroom beef burger. estimated calories and protein please? had one single thick patty
10/12/2024, 12:56 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
So i am making these potato chips, and i am confused should i weigh them raw or after air frying?
10/12/2024, 12:57 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
This is the right entry as per macros for flex seed??
10/12/2024, 2:16 am - Taha Ahmed: Track it as just potato, for more accuracy
10/12/2024, 2:22 am - Taha Ahmed: Typically ~450-600 calories and around 25-35g of protein, depending on the patty size and toppings
I'd lean on the higher side cause it's loaded with sauces and has cheese, right?
10/12/2024, 2:27 am - Taha Ahmed: It's close!
100g flax seeds has about ~530 calories, 42g fat, 29g carbs, 18g protein
So 1tbsp, which is roughly ~15g, has about 80 calories, 6.3g fat, 4.3g carbs and 2.7g protein
10/12/2024, 2:29 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Then I should add 80 calories to be a safe side?
10/12/2024, 2:31 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, sure
10/12/2024, 3:03 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: yes it did.
i added a quarter pounder but wasnt sure. I'll go w 600 thanks
10/12/2024, 11:45 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: An easy 500 and I would have tracked it for myself as 550 to be on the safe side @923343773307 🙌🏼
10/12/2024, 12:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Quarter pounder is also fine. I just like to overestimate a bit if I am trying to lose fat, easier to create a calorie deficit, esp if I am eating yummy, delicious foods like burgers, pizza, pasta, etc. 😋
10/12/2024, 12:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah easy 500 haha!
But I'd still track more :p
10/12/2024, 1:22 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i went with 650 @923343773307 
bus theek hai 😅
10/12/2024, 1:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think 650 might be slightly on the higher side, but if you’re okay with it, then go for it. Tracking food when eating out is always tricky, and overestimating a bit helps remove any doubt from the equation

10/12/2024, 3:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Great! Take a look at the message I tagged you in above, those estimates are pretty close
10/12/2024, 7:53 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: I had about 300g of fried fish. What would be the estimated calories?
10/12/2024, 7:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Tricky to tell without a picture, but somewhere between ~600-900 calories, depending on the type of fish and batter used

10/12/2024, 11:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: I can't really tell its actual size haha 
Looks like a miniature version 😂
10/12/2024, 11:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That looks to me like a McDonald’s cone size ice cream
10/12/2024, 11:38 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Looks like ihop's nutella waffle to me
10/12/2024, 11:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Really? To me it looks like a cute small serving of icecream waffle

10/12/2024, 11:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ice cream we shared too
10/12/2024, 11:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It was whippy vanilla
10/12/2024, 11:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I think track it as a medium sized waffle & 25-30g nutella 
@923343773307 @60193244266 what do u say

10/12/2024, 11:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: And maybe track it as 0.5 servings of everything, I guess

11/12/2024, 12:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks interesting, but I’m not sure how I feel about having cottage cheese in my lava cake 😂. Honestly, I’d rather enjoy the lava cake as is and pair it with a protein shake on the side for the protein.

Har cheez ko high protein banane ki zarurat nahi hoti 😂 (and that’s coming from someone who used to add protein powder to literally everything I cooked).
11/12/2024, 1:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: With that being said, you don’t taste the cottage cheese in this. 

I’ve had similar stuff.

Are these too many calories consumed for 1/3rd of the day
12/12/2024, 12:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not necessarily! It all depends on what works best for you.

Some people like having a big breakfast, taking it easy throughout the day, and then enjoying a big dinner.
Others prefer to keep all their meals evenly sized.
And some skip breakfast altogether, have a light lunch, and go for a big dinner.

The key is to find what fits your routine and preferences. Just make sure you're hitting your protein goals - that's the main priority!
12/12/2024, 12:02 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ill mention my struggles as i go.
Hopefully i will learn what fits me
 
Hopefully i will not have to skip my milk coffees as always suggested by others 😰
12/12/2024, 12:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, you won't have to avoid milk coffees!
250ml whole milk has about ~160kcals
But if you can get 1% fat milk, then that's ~100 kcals in 250ml
12/12/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Nida Umer: That would be nesvita? Low fat?
12/12/2024, 12:19 pm - PF - Nida Umer: What about the dairy milk when we let it set and remove the cream from top - how to record that
12/12/2024, 12:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): nesvita is low fat ~102calories per 250ml
12/12/2024, 12:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no thats not low fat
12/12/2024, 12:28 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How to record this one

12/12/2024, 3:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Your protein intake could be increased, and it might help to manage your fat and carb intake better so you don't go over your calories
12/12/2024, 3:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Add more high volume foods like vegetables etc and manage calorie dense foods so you can eat more
12/12/2024, 3:47 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ok iA hopefully will start getting the hang of it

741 calories are left in my target for today. But mujhy beef burger Khana hai #Cravings . I don't know why I'm starving today like anything 😂😂😂

Aab mai Kia keron? Tea party+dinner gtg. And it's still 04:07pm here. Lol. <This message was edited>
12/12/2024, 4:14 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
Okay?
12/12/2024, 4:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks fine
12/12/2024, 4:16 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Now how to hit 54g protein in 400 cals
12/12/2024, 4:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A beef burger is only about 550-600 calories. So you can definitely fit it in.
12/12/2024, 4:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yeah. You are right. 
But Raat 2 bje taak and next morning taak fasting kerain phr. :p 

Why am I thinking "saada ki bhooki ki insan today".  Hahaha

I don't know but it's very difficult to control today. The over eating thing. Might be stressed out or some other factor.
12/12/2024, 4:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How was sleep?
12/12/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: <Media omitted>

12/12/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: <Media omitted>
12/12/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: Is this okay?
12/12/2024, 4:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah not bad. I think 3tsp oil is enough for this but you can use 4 if you want to be safe.
12/12/2024, 4:41 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Hi Nida. Fellow member Yasir here. 

I know it feels like a lot to take in initially but when you take it 1 day at a time, In Sha Allah you will see the puzzle pieces fall into place one by one and realise it's quite simple. There's no rush 😊
12/12/2024, 4:44 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I slept for three hours last night.  😐
Had one hour walk then watched the series and slept. <This message was edited>
12/12/2024, 4:46 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: You have the best coaches guiding you every step of the way and you can ask as many questions as you want for better understanding and clarity. You will get the hang of this soon (speaking from personal experience) 🙌🏼
12/12/2024, 5:03 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: x2
12/12/2024, 5:04 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: if I'm taking nuggets or sausages (processed meat) everyday. is that healthy? 
someone around me said too much processed food is bad
12/12/2024, 5:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: That someone is probably right that too much processed food isn’t ideal, but the question is - what’s too much? Two sausages a day or 20?

It’s the dose that makes the poison. Having nuggets or sausages in moderation is perfectly fine, especially if the rest of your diet includes plenty of whole foods like veggies, fruits, and lean proteins. It’s all about balance!

P.S. Sameet eats nuggets/sausages almost every day!
12/12/2024, 5:37 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: <Media omitted>
Idk if that’s a silly question but- 
If I have chicken with bones like this one is 177 grams right.
Shall I remove the weight of bones later? 
It was 23 gms. 
So 177 chicken or 153 gms 🙈
12/12/2024, 5:38 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: <Media omitted>
Alsoo, is this entry fine? I don’t add any oil whatsoever while baking just masalas and all
12/12/2024, 5:45 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Is there any guide for how and what supplements to take. 
I seem to lose all energy by this time of the day.
I drag my self through the rest of the day by consuming coffee
12/12/2024, 5:56 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: 153
12/12/2024, 5:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s you answer. Less sleep means more hunger and cravings.
12/12/2024, 6:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Every day. But it’s only 20-25% of my total calories. 

BALANCE! 

Most people worry about processed food aren’t even getting their daily protein and fibre intakes. That’s far more dangerous to health than a few nuggets.
12/12/2024, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s your sleep like? That’s where I’d start
12/12/2024, 6:04 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: What would be the solution then? If I'm having less sleep for a day or two per week?
12/12/2024, 6:08 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you Yasir
I feel there is so much to fix
The diet the workouts the step counts 😰
12/12/2024, 6:09 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Jazakallah 
Yea i was thinking am i asking too much 😂
12/12/2024, 6:10 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Is this the right entry for a samosa filled with chicken Qeema?
The samosa was not a tiny one, but a medium size.
12/12/2024, 6:10 pm - PF - Nida Umer: 5-6 hrs
12/12/2024, 6:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s no solution to it other than getting more sleep or taking a nap. 

But understanding why you’re hungry or getting cravings can help you not give in to them. 

Or you can choose to spend that day at maintenance calories too.
12/12/2024, 6:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent.
12/12/2024, 6:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s why you’re low on energy. 

You can use caffeine and all too push you through the day but till you fix the root cause, you’re likely going to struggle with energy. 

Not to forget that if you’re having caffeine and sleeping in 8 hours or less, the caffeine is still in your system and going to reduce sleep quality and quality. 

So often people get stuck in this cycle. 

Low sleep leads to more caffeine, caffeine leads to less sleep and so on.
12/12/2024, 6:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How many hours is recommended?
12/12/2024, 6:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I always thought 6 hrs is fine
12/12/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: That makes sense. Thanks! 
I never thought of the relationship b/w less sleep and cravings. Will be mindful of it now onwards. ✨🙂
12/12/2024, 6:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 7-9 hours
12/12/2024, 6:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, sleep has a massive impact on hunger hormones and stress hormones.
12/12/2024, 6:20 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Never even knew it till today
12/12/2024, 6:20 pm - PF - Nida Umer: No wonder! 🤷🏻‍♀️
12/12/2024, 6:21 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: I think I make better choices in food when I’ve slept well. 
Its easier to control your cravings too.
12/12/2024, 6:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely 🙏
12/12/2024, 6:22 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Omg yes!!!
And the constant headaches🙈
12/12/2024, 6:23 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Stress hormones Vs sleep, I know. But sleep Vs Hunger never thought of. 

But sameet, if we have long working hours, and we don't have time to sleep properly for 7-9 hours. 

Taab what would be the remedy for energy boost or else?
12/12/2024, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Finding a new job 😂🤣😂

But If im being serious, you either decide to not lose weight and focus on maintenance calories. More food can help with energy levels. 

You can also focus on caffeine earlier in the day so it doesn’t disrupt sleep. 

And lastly I’d highly recommend working on sleep hygiene.
12/12/2024, 6:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Whats sleep hygiene
12/12/2024, 6:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Sorry i am intruding in ur response to someone else
12/12/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Epiphenomenal 🤷🏻‍♀️
12/12/2024, 6:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1. Not using any screens an hour before bed
2. ⁠Bot having caffeine 8-9 hours before bed
3. ⁠making sure you’re bedroom is dark 
4. ⁠making sure your bedroom is cold (19-20 degrees is ideal for sleep based on some research)
5. ⁠not engaging in any thing that activates brain or stress before bed
12/12/2024, 6:38 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Some things that have helped me in sleeping better are 
- no caffeine after 7
- ⁠no phone (mindless scrolling type) an hour before bed
- ⁠a light walk after dinner specialllly if i had a heavy meal 
- ⁠and read a book before sleeping that just puts me in mood
12/12/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I should focus on number 1 only, it will balance number 5 too. 

Rest is perfect at my side. 😂
12/12/2024, 6:45 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Wow
Sab ghalat he
I am failing at this🤦🏼‍♀️
12/12/2024, 6:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I wish I could change my Profession, not job 😜 hahaha. 

Well. I think as you said earlier, if we know the main cause, less sleep, caffeine or else. It can be managed very well.  ✨
12/12/2024, 6:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: And maintenance calories means 250-300 more calories than targeted, a day? <This message was edited>
12/12/2024, 6:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is good sleep hygiene in a nutshell 🤌
12/12/2024, 6:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, 300-400 more than your deficit.
12/12/2024, 6:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 is the biggest reason for sleep deprivation in my opinion. 

That’s what ruins it for most people. Including me.
12/12/2024, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: There’s NOTHING to fix, only to improve!  
You’re not some broken vase. 🤷🏽‍♂
12/12/2024, 6:56 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes, for all of us. 😂
12/12/2024, 7:05 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Is a walk after dinner ok?
Contrary to popular opinion
12/12/2024, 7:06 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Sad truth
12/12/2024, 7:06 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Hahaha love this!!!
12/12/2024, 7:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Whenever you want!
12/12/2024, 8:42 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Can i use this to have a generic percentage of bone weight
I didnt weight my 🦴
12/12/2024, 8:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): around 40ish gram is bone weight for chicken leg and thigh
25ish gram for chicken chest piece
12/12/2024, 8:54 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Coaches @923343773307 @60193244266 @923441183411 ... what kind of card should I do, if I am diabetic... I mean I am prediabetic...I don't want to go on meds and all
12/12/2024, 8:54 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Want to correct it with lifestyle  changes
12/12/2024, 8:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you made any lifestyle changes?
12/12/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Walking and strength training
12/12/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Including more protein
12/12/2024, 8:59 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Don't judge me, but I am not going for thr blood work
12/12/2024, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s a good place to start.
12/12/2024, 9:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then how do you know you’re prediabetic. 

I’m not here to judge you though, ultimately it’s your decision and you decide what you want to do. 

Blood work can just help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
12/12/2024, 9:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your focus needs to be on reducing weight since that’s one of the risk factors of developing diabetes too.
12/12/2024, 9:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1. gradually lose weight & fat
2. ⁠increase protein & fiber intake
3. ⁠limit saturated fats & processed foods (limiting doesn't mean complete elimination)
4. ⁠Eat more whole & nutritionally rich foods
5. ⁠Increase your activity level. Whatever your current daily step count is increase it.
6. ⁠Workout 3-5 days a week
12/12/2024, 9:01 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Prediabetic, because I got the tests done almost a year back
12/12/2024, 9:02 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am at 10k+steps day...3 daysa week strength training...losing weight rather I would say fat also
12/12/2024, 9:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Maybe a good idea to get it checked again
12/12/2024, 9:02 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am kind of scared
12/12/2024, 9:02 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: It's in my family but a part of it is my fault
12/12/2024, 9:03 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: And my life and stres
12/12/2024, 9:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then u r doing very good already 
just keep up with it & please get your blood work done its only gona help
12/12/2024, 9:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: I understand, but it’s important to check if you’re still in the prediabetic range or not. These tests can give a clearer picture and guide the next steps. You might need more than just nutritional and fitness interventions, and consulting a professional could be beneficial
12/12/2024, 9:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): exactly
12/12/2024, 9:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: What if there’s nothing to worry about? If you don’t get it done, you’ll just end up stressing over something that might not even exist. Better to know and have clarity than to let unnecessary doubts linger 🤷🏽‍♂
12/12/2024, 9:10 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Actually yoh are right but changing eating habits gives me a feeling that oh...all the fun has ended now. ..
12/12/2024, 9:10 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: But I agree I need to go..
12/12/2024, 9:11 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Because I sense the symptoms a lot
12/12/2024, 9:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And the more knowledge you have, the more equipped you’ll be to tackle it.
12/12/2024, 9:16 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: 23g gulab jamun, approx calories?
12/12/2024, 9:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is that one small one?
12/12/2024, 9:22 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: Yes
12/12/2024, 9:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 80-90 calories
12/12/2024, 9:22 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: Alright thanks :)
12/12/2024, 9:27 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi left
12/12/2024, 9:32 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I had dinner like i usually do to see how much overboard i am on my daily intake. 😭
Also coz i was really hungry (again)
I guess this will also help me to see how much i need to cut back 

- does this constant hunger feeling ever end?
12/12/2024, 9:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The hunger isn’t because you’re on a diet. It’s because of food choices for the most part. 

And lack of sleep too.
12/12/2024, 9:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could eat 3000 calories and still be hungry if you’re chronically sleep deprived.
12/12/2024, 9:36 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Whaattt
12/12/2024, 9:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: My parents are diabetic and one of our dr. threatened me/us (siblings) to be the potential victim of it. Before COVID, my test result was in range prediabetic. I had tried to find the root cause and it was insulin resistance (PCOS). I had made a few changes in my lifestyle and treated the PCOS. Now in May-June, I again got my self tested. And I am in a very normal range of it. 

So don't make yourself stressed out. Just focus on yourself and the root cause. ✨😊

13/12/2024, 12:23 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I got myself out of a deep hole (healthwise) this year. I was stuck in a rut, completely sedentary lifestyle, poor diet. But then I took a step in the right direction. Initially it did look like a lot of work, but as a short time passed, I realised I just needed to restructure and prioritize things for myself. Learning went hand in Hand with implementation and before I even knew it, I found myself thinking "huh, it actually is quite easy why was I so worried 😂"
13/12/2024, 12:37 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Wa iyaaki. Ask away. We are all here to learn and no need to hesitate 🙌🏼

13/12/2024, 12:43 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @60193244266 when I first learned about sleep x hunger relationship, I made a conscious effort to monitor both these things. And you are absolutely right. I checked both after good and terrible night's sleep. Massive difference indeed 🙌🏼
13/12/2024, 12:44 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thank you for mentioning this as well. 👍🏼
13/12/2024, 12:45 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: <Media omitted>

13/12/2024, 12:57 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1st just to be a safe side
13/12/2024, 12:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923330277703 Diabetes runs in my family too. My dad is also diabetic. 

I got myself tested a few days back. And I found out I'm pre-diabetic. I'll be following the nutrition and fitness advice of my coaches (Facebook post) + doctor's recommendation. Three months down the line I'll definitely get the test done again to see where I stand. So I know if  further action needs to be taken. If I'm normal, I can enjoy the mental peace
13/12/2024, 1:38 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you
Thats really encouraging. I can get very awkward at times and sometimes it feels i am asking too much or too many silly questions 🙈

I’d consider myself in a rut right now too. Its a cycle i keep going around in. But iA will come around. Just need to make it work.

13/12/2024, 2:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There was 450g of rice? That’s a lot of rice lol
13/12/2024, 2:41 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: I didnt measure each separately so approximated it
13/12/2024, 2:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d add 4-5tsp oil for this quantity.
13/12/2024, 2:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine
13/12/2024, 2:41 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: Okay thanks
13/12/2024, 2:42 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Please say it looks lesser than 450😆
13/12/2024, 3:31 pm - PF - Nida Umer: @60193244266

13/12/2024, 3:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Haven’t done Xanders but we can always estimate.
13/12/2024, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha could be 450 easily waisay since the entire serving was 650.
13/12/2024, 3:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Lol ok

Who out there doesn’t like food? I absolutely love food. But that doesn’t mean health can’t be a priority.
13/12/2024, 3:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No fries?
13/12/2024, 3:39 pm - PF - Nida Umer: 4-5

13/12/2024, 3:40 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Pizza was chicken basil n feta
13/12/2024, 3:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 slices of pizza - add dominos lare
Club sandwich - add an entry around 150-175 calories 
Pasta - add an entry around 150ish calories too 

@923343773307 what say?
13/12/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ok lemme add and put here
13/12/2024, 4:08 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
13/12/2024, 4:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Decent
13/12/2024, 5:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: This looks good as is, I'd just a tsp of oil because that sandwich looks like it's been toasted with either butter or oil
13/12/2024, 8:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: It wasnt soggy with oil but yea u r right
Thats what is mostly added

Wowzie - such nitty gritty 🙌🏻 <This message was edited>

So will probably skip dinner

Is that ok?

13/12/2024, 10:11 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hi,
I have been taking 1 scoop of whey protein for four days but I always feel nausea type and ajeeb si feeling after. Even chocolate flavour powder. 

Is it normal? Or 🥺

13/12/2024, 10:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks delicious
13/12/2024, 10:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is it because of the taste?
13/12/2024, 10:25 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Can it be constipation or bloating? 🌚 I experienced something similar
13/12/2024, 10:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Not really, the taste is just okay. 
I never had whey protein before Kabhi bhi. Is it so? 

Or timing. I don't know. But it's a little bit uncomfortable for some time like an hour or 2, then the feeling is fine. <This message was edited>

I absolutely love having this but have no idea how to calculate calories. The weight is around 25g. Can someone help me out.
13/12/2024, 10:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can use this tracking
13/12/2024, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You might be lactose intolerant to an extent. 

Ever had issues after having a glass or two of milk or some ice cream?
13/12/2024, 11:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm not.  I never had this feeling after milk or ice-cream. 
🥺

I'm not adding it in milk. Just water. <This message was edited>
13/12/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but the powder itself is milk
13/12/2024, 11:13 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Maybe try having half a scoop in milk or something and see how you feel. 
I hated the taste at first while having it with just water 🤢
Different variations are good for me now. 

My fav is having weetabix/milk/ chocolate whey protein! <This message was edited>
13/12/2024, 11:21 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Then what will you suggest?

Should do as Merium suggests? Should i try it with different things?
13/12/2024, 11:21 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees joined using this group's invite link
13/12/2024, 11:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah definitely worth a shot.

14/12/2024, 12:42 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Is this entry alright?
14/12/2024, 12:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I would add 4tsp oil to be at a safe side & around 110-115g roti 
because it looks like a big paratha
14/12/2024, 1:05 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk
14/12/2024, 1:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Sounds good
14/12/2024, 1:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's stress eating, not necessarily your body needing more food. It's okay to have an extra 200-300 calories occasionally - it won't make a big difference. But if this happens frequently, it's important to be more mindful of your hunger cues. Also, adding more volume to your meals (like veggies or high-fiber foods) can help keep you fuller for longer

But usually when we're stressed, we often eat to distract ourselves from what's really bothering us, not to nourish our bodies. The best thing to do is to sit with the discomfort and those uncomfortable feelings - maybe journal about why you're feeling this way instead of turning to food every time. It’s a way to face your emotions and feelings instead of escaping them (which, let’s be real, we’ve all become pros at in this age and time)
14/12/2024, 1:38 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: If I’m eating with my phone on, and jaldi jaldi kha lun tou I feel I haven’t eaten much. 
Although same person if I’ve eaten araam se mindfully without distractions makes me full.
14/12/2024, 1:38 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Can u give examples of more fibrous foods
14/12/2024, 1:40 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lentils, legumes
14/12/2024, 1:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: When we eat quickly or while distracted, like with a phone in hand, it’s common to feel like we haven’t eaten enough. That’s because it takes time for our body’s satiety hormones to signal that we’re full - roughly 20 minutes or so. Eating mindfully, at a slower pace, allows these signals to catch up, helping us feel satisfied with less food. (I have a friend who eats a double patty beef burger with a side of fries in under 6-7 minutes and that's when I am around, she's often told me that she eats faster than that when alone)

On the other hand, when we eat too fast, we often overshoot our actual needs, leading to overeating. This is why mindful eating - sitting down without distractions, chewing properly, and savoring each bite - can make a huge difference (if you ever see me eating, you'll want to help me finish it because I eat so slow haha, @60193244266 seen me do that recently)

Oh, and just sharing a thought- this isn’t directly related to our conversation but more about overeating.

Culturally, a lot of us are conditioned to overeat, whether by our own habits or societal/familial expectations. It’s worth questioning those patterns and paying attention to what our body actually needs, instead of eating just to clear the plate. (Ghar walay aksar kehtay hain “Khana khatam karo, nahi tou gunah milega.” Gunah ka tou pata nahi, but Eating Disorders zarur ho jata hai!)
14/12/2024, 1:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. That’s called mindful eating. And there’s research behind this. 

When distracted you eat more.
14/12/2024, 1:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: He’s tooooooo slow. 🤣🤣
14/12/2024, 1:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, you can keep the plate in the fridge and come to it later. That way no wastage, no overeating. 

No gunnah. No eating disorders.
14/12/2024, 2:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Not me reading this while eating 🙈🙈
14/12/2024, 2:18 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): When i eat a snack when i am on calorie deficit i eat as small bites as i can it makes my craving satisfy
14/12/2024, 2:21 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
14/12/2024, 2:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: We’ve really forgotten the art of savoring and truly enjoying our food. Everything these days is so fast-paced, and we’re always in a rush, even when it comes to eating

This constant need for instant gratification spills into other areas of life too, leading to stress and health issues. Taking the time to slow down and be mindful - even with a small snack - can make a big difference, not just in satisfying cravings but in reducing overall stress as well
14/12/2024, 2:21 pm - PF - Nida Umer: So i just brush my pan with oil… i checked n it wasnt even 1/4th of a tsp
14/12/2024, 2:22 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Is that why u eat so slow?
14/12/2024, 2:22 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Like is it mindful or habitual
14/12/2024, 2:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: It started as a mindful habit and it's become a part of me now. I like to savor my food, each bite!
I don't like the idea of inhaling food anymore
If I am on a time crunch, I'd rather take a few bites and finish it later (when I can sit down properly and eat aaram se)
Jaldi kis cheez ki hai?
This amazing food will be here. I'll be here. The world's not ending, phir rush kaisa? ;)
14/12/2024, 2:25 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Also, when meeting up with friends- we’re looking forward what to eat mostly rather than looking forward to the conversations. 

And about the eating disorders, I’ve been dealing with those even now. With my kids though, I had to reparent myself in order to ask them that finishing the plate even when you want to puke isnt important. That it is okay to leave the plate if you’re full. Now we give the leftovers to the birds outside (we’ve kept a separate plate outside our house, so it isnt going in the dustbin) no disrespect to the food too!
14/12/2024, 2:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're sure about it 1/4th oil, then go for it!

One thing I always suggest when trying to lose weight is to slightly overestimate your intake, this helps account for any margin of error and keeps you on track
14/12/2024, 2:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Love that!
14/12/2024, 2:26 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This is amazing
I struggle with this too living with in laws

The gunah comment is just always there.
14/12/2024, 2:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Pehle khud bache ki plate bhar do

14/12/2024, 2:30 pm - PF - Nida Umer: And i have enough left for dinner today 😍
14/12/2024, 2:30 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you coaches
14/12/2024, 2:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: There you go!
Took you 3 days to get a hang of it 💪🏽
14/12/2024, 4:47 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I have always left it after 3 days 😂
Dont think i am doing that now 🤞🏻
14/12/2024, 4:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: You've got this!
14/12/2024, 7:52 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I can relate to your friend. I used to do that in the past and even after finishing I would still feel hungry cuz the satiety signals were still far away. So I would reach for something else then.
14/12/2024, 7:55 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Also when I'm at gatherings or parties, I openly tell people I want to put stuff on my plate by myself. That way I'm in control of the quantity, I'm left with enough space to move easy, breathe easy. No overeating and plate also gets empty. It's a win-win for me 😎
14/12/2024, 7:55 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Wonderful. Alhumdullilah good to see you are getting the hang of it
14/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: This speaks everything for me.. I feel i am always in a rush and get on to next thing.. even when I am not in rush i am rushing and my husband says kia hogha hai bhaiii kia jaldi hai.. I really never sit and enjoy my food too often

14/12/2024, 8:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes add 2-3tsp oil
14/12/2024, 8:17 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This is measured cooked masoor daal
14/12/2024, 8:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): cooked lentil entry will be much accurate

15/12/2024, 1:18 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah not bad.
15/12/2024, 1:54 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, most of us tend to do this so you're not alone. It's why bringing awareness to this is very important and it's not only with food. We do this with most things in life
15/12/2024, 4:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Not related. But just to make awareness. 

My son has had a cough for 3 or 4 days and wasn't eating well. Also vomited a few times. I was giving him fluids and little bit food here and there. 

In the morning he was unconscious and was not responding. We called an ambulance and they came. He woke up I gave him sugary drink.  His blood sugar was 1.2 after taking vimto squash . Which is way too low. Right now he has gone to hospital with my husband. Just be aware of these cues. If your child has diarrhea or vomit or not eating and drinking enough. Make sure they have juice
15/12/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Prayers for your child's speedy recovery..🙏
15/12/2024, 4:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you for sharing this, it’s such an important reminder to watch for signs of dehydration or low blood sugar in kids. Hope your son feels better soon! Keep us posted, please?!!
15/12/2024, 4:43 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: You are all welcome. Please pray for him. I got scared I thought it was so much worse . For 5 minutes he was not responding.  I had two other kids . They were been sick but nothing like that happened. LOW SUGAR can be very dangerous. My son is only 3

Mustard?
15/12/2024, 6:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So a roasted sub is 320. 

Cheese would be another 40. 

And then you add whatever sauces you want and add entries for that.
15/12/2024, 6:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ok great
15/12/2024, 6:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t eat just chicken and bread lol. It was just to give you an idea of calories.

I'm a bit confused.
Kia yeh Chaplin kabab waqaee 100g Ka ho ga?
100g
145 Kcal
12g protein 
8g fat
7g carbs

In the nutrient facts of the box, it's written 100g. But per serving or per one piece is not mentioned.

I forgot to weigh it but I'm a little doubtful, it was oily even though I didn't use oil to fry it, just 30 sec  microwave before frying.
16/12/2024, 1:20 am - PF - Marium Hamza: I think per kabab would be 75g,
Since 4 kababs are around 300ish grams (296 total weight for 4)
16/12/2024, 1:28 am - PF - Asma Tariq: When packed is also mentioned. 

It's ambiguous.
16/12/2024, 2:38 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I used to have two of these daily for 5 years ahhahaha

A kebab is around 75g
16/12/2024, 2:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: So if you’re having one kebab that calories will be 75% of the 100g mentioned one
16/12/2024, 3:33 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Lol. How?

It's very salted and teeekha bhi. :p
16/12/2024, 3:44 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I loved it. Used to have it for breakfast. 

One kebab on a slice of bread with some lettuce and tomatoes. 

And ketchup. 

Open faced sandwich. 

Or I would have two of these. Two of their shami kebabs. With some yogurt and roti. 

Loved it. 35-40g protein in that meal too
16/12/2024, 3:49 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Second combo is just ❤️

Thanks for sharing.
16/12/2024, 10:16 am - PF - Nida Umer: Successfully said no to paratha qeema at work today -
1. Having had my breakfast helped
2. ⁠Being more mindful of my choices helped
3. ⁠Not actually being a paratha person helped(dont kill me)
16/12/2024, 10:17 am - PF - Nida Umer: Also for the record

16/12/2024, 5:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks similar to KFC kentucky burger
16/12/2024, 5:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: The patty looks big
16/12/2024, 6:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Zinger with cheese*

16/12/2024, 6:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Does it make a difference?
16/12/2024, 6:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I hv extensive work days this week
16/12/2024, 6:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope. Not much! 
Unless it's fat free etc
16/12/2024, 6:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: And i tend to keep having coffee while working
16/12/2024, 6:02 pm - PF - Nida Umer: The low fat nesvita is not fat free?
16/12/2024, 6:02 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How can i reduce my cals on that
16/12/2024, 6:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly! So fewer calories per 100ml than day fresh
16/12/2024, 6:03 pm - PF - Nida Umer: So i should invest in that😂
16/12/2024, 6:03 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Rather than have free coffee at work
16/12/2024, 6:03 pm - PF - Nida Umer: 🤪
16/12/2024, 6:04 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Plain black coffee if you can handle it 😁

16/12/2024, 6:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I like a good americano. But it’s not the same as some milk and sweetener.
16/12/2024, 6:08 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Yasir 🙌🏼
16/12/2024, 6:08 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Finalllllyyyy someone agreees

16/12/2024, 6:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s what I mean by good espresso or americano. 

But even then. Add some milk plus sweetener to it and 🤌🤌🤌
16/12/2024, 6:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): tastes that bad
16/12/2024, 6:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Instant coffee tou zehr hi hai taste main ahhahaha

16/12/2024, 6:17 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Managing a nespresso machine in Pakistan is ☠️
16/12/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: See rare occasions I do go for a latte or cappuccino but the milk and the sweetener/sugar take away from the taste of coffee itself. I can't taste the actual coffee flavors so that's why plain black for me 😎
16/12/2024, 6:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: My parents go back in a week.
I can try sending some and you can pick them up from their house

17/12/2024, 4:07 pm - PF - Sawera Shamshad: When I did keto during COVID I was told to have this monstrosity twice a day. Sab cheezain kharab Kar do Saath main daal ke, Kisi Ka Bhi Maza Nahi rehta
17/12/2024, 4:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Twice a day? Woh bhi k keto.  🙄🤣

17/12/2024, 4:11 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Is that the reason for break up?🙈

18/12/2024, 3:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ll record it in a couple of days
18/12/2024, 3:10 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Can u also make a separate folder for ur recipe reels on insta please
18/12/2024, 3:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: How do I do that? I’ve been trying lol
18/12/2024, 3:16 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
Like these..u already have them
18/12/2024, 3:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh highlights. 

Let me see if I can add them here.
18/12/2024, 3:24 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Is that what they’re called sorry lol
18/12/2024, 3:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha yeah. No worries.
18/12/2024, 3:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Made it.
18/12/2024, 8:28 am - PF - Nida Umer: I had a bad day yesterday 
Couldnt track a single thing
Sleep was bad the previous night
Work was hectic and overtime 

Ended in me eating far more calories 😤
I is sad
I know aik din doesnt matter in the bigger picture but feels like i threw one week ki mehnat down the drain

I need a lift me up ( wrapped in a reality check😂)
18/12/2024, 8:28 am - PF - Nida Umer: Lol
18/12/2024, 8:35 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You havn't thorwn down ek week ki mehnat down the drain 
there will be days like this where you will struggle abit but its part of the process it can't be a smooth ride throughout. You have to be mentally prepared for days like this & don't let it get into your head too much. Take it normally 
Just get back in routine from today & you will be just fine. Trust me !!

we are here to support you guide you & we will not let you lose the track🤜🤛
18/12/2024, 12:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey, I get where you’re coming from. But let’s think of this as if you’re climbing a staircase. Missing one step doesn’t mean you fall all the way down to the bottom! You’re still further along than when you started. What matters is that you get back on the next step today!

Or perhaps imagine you’re driving and take a wrong turn. Do you abandon the car and give up on the trip? Of course not. (HOPEFULLY NOT, HAHA 😂) You just simply adjust your route and get back on track.  Adjusting or taking another U-turn means you add a couple more minutes, but you're on track nonetheless. That’s what you’re doing right now by showing up and reflecting on yesterday.

What I like is that you noticed what happened, which means you’re mindful of your journey (self-awareness) - many people do this on an autonomous mode, they barely even realize. And like I keep saying, progress isn’t about perfection; it’s about consistency over time. One stormy day doesn’t ruin an entire season. Get back to your routine today, and you’ll see how small this one off-day really is in the grand scheme of things.
18/12/2024, 1:21 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: <Media omitted>
Is this cooked or uncooked?
18/12/2024, 1:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think uncooked.
18/12/2024, 1:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Most probs uncooked!
18/12/2024, 1:34 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: 50g cooked k lie uncooked kitna likhun?
18/12/2024, 1:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100gm cooked = ~130gm
so add 65g
18/12/2024, 1:45 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk
18/12/2024, 3:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Just what i needed after a shitty day at work😂❤️
18/12/2024, 3:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you
18/12/2024, 3:36 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: While I get lost I used to call my husband to pick me up and drive me back home. 😆
18/12/2024, 3:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And on the way we eat a burger 🍔
18/12/2024, 3:38 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But I'm disciplined.. 

I ate shit food at the hospital. 🙊
18/12/2024, 3:39 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Glad to be back home and carry on
18/12/2024, 3:43 pm - PF - Ali Haider: What if we miss a turn on a motorway. It would be a long journey coming back 😔
18/12/2024, 3:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha, fair point, but even if you miss a turn on the motorway, you’ll eventually get back on track, right? Unless you’re THAT person who misses the U-turn, keeps driving, crosses into another city, applies for residency there, finds a job, starts a new life, builds a house, and completely forgets about the original destination 😅

But hey, if that happens, maybe it’s destiny, or maybe you’re just really committed to taking the scenic route! Either way, the journey continues, and you’ll get where you need to be. So don’t stress, just make the turn now before you end up starting a whole new countrywide adventure 😂 hahah I am ded! 🫠
18/12/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: That's like getting fat , find a fat wife and have fat kids
18/12/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: 🙊
18/12/2024, 3:52 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Please take a u turn

18/12/2024, 4:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hmm, it sounds like there’s a lot going on in the background in your life right now, and it might be worth reflecting on the bigger picture beyond just fitness. When big changes happen, it can stir up a lot of emotions and uncertainties, which might be contributing to how you're feeling 🤷🏽‍♂

It's not just about missing a turn in your journey and adapting honestly- it’s about acknowledging what those detours represent (esp if you feel like you're somewhere else but trying to pursue a goal that's not aligned with you). Life is full of unexpected changes. Maybe let’s take this as a moment for re-evaluation?? so you don’t just feel like you’re reacting to everything, but actively steering yourself forward (may sound vague but what it means is that you see what you're able to do in this moment and then pursue that only instead of setting goals larger than current life). The more the awareness, both mentally and emotionally, the more clarity you'll find in this situation

I didn't want to go on a tangent here but felt like this could help everyone here in this group! Take what you please and leave the rest. 🙏🏽
18/12/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How much cals for a dahi bara
18/12/2024, 7:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 150 sounds decent.

18/12/2024, 9:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Very light indeed 😹
18/12/2024, 9:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fine. 

You can search cooked ground beef if you can’t find an entry.
18/12/2024, 9:15 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: random question 😅 i have cousins who eat alloot. 'phir b unhe nahi lagta'. whats the science there?
18/12/2024, 9:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You think they eat a lot. They don’t. 

I was blamed for this all my life.
18/12/2024, 9:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I started believing it myself.
18/12/2024, 9:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then I started tracking. Even though I was eating a burger or something every day, I barely ever crossed 2000 calories.
18/12/2024, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: My brother ate a might zinger every night and people use to say the same
Thing. 

He was stick thin. Because that’s all he ate in a day. 


Now he started having other meals and he’s gained weight.
18/12/2024, 9:18 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: okay
18/12/2024, 9:18 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: makes sense

18/12/2024, 11:03 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Have some garlic sauce on the side. It will add to the taste
18/12/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I meant if i had tracked correctly
18/12/2024, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sure about the oil? And chicken ki quantity? Everything else looks good.
18/12/2024, 11:32 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Yes weighed the chicken
18/12/2024, 11:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: It was raw when i weighed
18/12/2024, 11:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Yes just brushed the pan
18/12/2024, 11:34 pm - PF - Nida Umer: What abt some fat on the chicken?
18/12/2024, 11:35 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Should i add more oil for that or rely on the one in the entry
18/12/2024, 11:40 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I would have added 2 tea spoon oil just to be on the safe side <This message was edited>
18/12/2024, 11:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: Can you share a SS of the chicken thigh entry you selected? i want to see its overall calories and macros
100gm chicken thigh has around 180ish calories so if you had 245gm, that'd definitely have more calories imo, but let's check it
18/12/2024, 11:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Usually, you don't have to because these entries account for all fat content of the chicken
18/12/2024, 11:58 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
19/12/2024, 12:00 am - Taha Ahmed: This one has very less fat (chicken thigh has a lot more)
Like 100gm chicken thigh has around 8-9g of fat and 22-24g of protein and ~170-180 calories <This message was edited>
19/12/2024, 12:00 am - PF - Nida Umer: Ok let me look for some other
19/12/2024, 12:01 am - Taha Ahmed: Is it boneless chicken thigh?
19/12/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Nida Umer: Yes

19/12/2024, 12:31 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
i had steamed chicken. it was 2 leg pieces and another random piece idk about. so is this tracked right? since for nida you said 100gm would have 180 kcal. do the pieces differ in calories that much? i dont have a picture for it. also makes me think I've been tracking my chicken wrong too 😅
19/12/2024, 12:32 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: can there be a guide for this too? 😅 so we know which entries to choose. i don't usually get time to read all the chats so im sure i miss out on the info. i do try to search for the dish if I'm ever confused.
19/12/2024, 12:33 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Already working on this.
19/12/2024, 12:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is okay
19/12/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: phew. thankyou 😅

19/12/2024, 11:44 am - PF - Nida Umer: Average is pretty much same
19/12/2024, 11:44 am - PF - Nida Umer: 😭😭
19/12/2024, 11:45 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, esp if you weigh only once in a week
19/12/2024, 11:45 am - Taha Ahmed: There are so many factors at play
19/12/2024, 11:52 am - PF - Nida Umer: I weighed 3 times last week
19/12/2024, 12:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Especially with women with the menstrual cycle is also at play
19/12/2024, 12:54 pm - PF - Nida Umer: 🎯
19/12/2024, 1:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Don't stress out yourself. ✨
It happnes. Just enjoy the process and food Initially. Frequently scaling se stress ho ga if numbers are not decreasing.

19/12/2024, 7:42 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i ate 2 kababs weighing 90g in total. they were shallow fried, i didn't make them so i don't know the oil used. how much should i add in mfp?

How to estimate calories in one of these? Weighed about 40g each
19/12/2024, 11:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is it like a dumpling?
19/12/2024, 11:45 pm - PF - Hussain Murtaza: Yess. Steamed
20/12/2024, 12:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hi,
This week is going with so many variations. One day total per day calories are 200 less than targeted and other day it's going to be more than 100-120. 
It's a bit hectic week with sleep and work. 
I hope the overall weekly target will be achieved and it doesn't matter much. Variations Right?
20/12/2024, 12:11 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: My friend is on a military diet . It's 3 days crash diet. Sounds really silly. But what is it and how can I explain to her to stick to eating healthy. ?

20/12/2024, 12:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just use dumplings ki entry.
20/12/2024, 12:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Weekly is what counts.
20/12/2024, 12:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And this is why people end up damaging their health in the long run

Please help me track this quantity on macrosfirst. Its chicken boti from red apple and a cucumber.
20/12/2024, 3:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks like 150ish gram of chicken
20/12/2024, 3:47 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Around 10 pieces of boti
20/12/2024, 3:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): log it as 150g chicken breast simple
20/12/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Ok. Im bad at estimating so need help initially. Thankyou.
20/12/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: No oil no nothing

Is this the right entry for 1tsp desi ghee (home made)?

Vegetable oil (1tsp) is for 40 cal?
20/12/2024, 6:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1g fat = 9 calories
5g fat = 45 calories

1tsp = 5g
1tbsp = 14g

The calories in fat are the same whether it's oil, ghee, or MCT etc.

I'm using this entry for bread (brown/bran) from a local  bakers near to my home.

Is this right? I was using a slice serving (91 cal) but today I had weighed the slice and it was 23-25g. I hope it's right for 2 slices.
20/12/2024, 6:36 pm - PF - Ali Haider: It's better to weigh the slices and log it in grams. That will be more accurate
20/12/2024, 7:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this id pretty good.

Steak burger calories estimate?
20/12/2024, 8:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 700ish probably.
20/12/2024, 8:05 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I choosed this because thought it will have less then zinger 🤡
20/12/2024, 8:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Beef is higher in calories than chicken so a lot of the difference in frying is compensated from that. 

And then since this has more stuff added to it then a standard beef cheese burger (which is 550-600), calories of this will be slightly higher.
20/12/2024, 8:14 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Its chicken
20/12/2024, 8:14 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And no cheese
20/12/2024, 8:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh kaunsa steak hota hai hahahaha

21/12/2024, 3:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s your current strength level?
21/12/2024, 6:56 am - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: In what terms?
21/12/2024, 7:10 am - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Do you mean in terms of how many reps of leg exercises?
21/12/2024, 8:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: In terms of weight you’re lifting
21/12/2024, 8:53 am - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: On machines, 145 lbs on quad extension, similar on hamstrings, 120 lbs on calf raises, 200 lbs squats. What do i need to aim for?
21/12/2024, 12:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s decent. Any split squats? 

Do you have access to a TRX? 

If so you can start doing assisted pistol squats to gradually build the strength and the skill.

21/12/2024, 4:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): without bones 80-90g chicken 
2tsp oil
21/12/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Cucumbers look around 80gm too right? <This message was edited>
21/12/2024, 4:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): cucumbers ko add krny ki zarurat nhi
21/12/2024, 4:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why don’t you track this on a scale? Way more accurate that way
21/12/2024, 4:22 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Im at work. At home i would always weigh
21/12/2024, 4:44 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Is that a mini white coated in choc and sprinkles? @923343773307
21/12/2024, 4:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's Magnum Classic with extra dark chocolate on top, plus chocolate sprinkles and crushed oreo :p
21/12/2024, 4:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: It wasn't a mini icecream AT ALL! :p hahaha <This message was edited>
21/12/2024, 4:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay, that’s fine then
21/12/2024, 6:20 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: What's on top
21/12/2024, 6:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This
21/12/2024, 6:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Magnum on it own is like 250 to 300 so added shit must be 100 to 200 so I would go for 400 to 500
21/12/2024, 6:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Magnum is usually 220-240. So yeah, good way to go about it
21/12/2024, 6:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: If it's 220-240. Then it's a good choice for ice cream cravings but without any coating 🤣
21/12/2024, 6:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, can be.
21/12/2024, 6:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My estimate will be exact 425 but estimate ker k . 450 or 470

22/12/2024, 3:47 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
22/12/2024, 3:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha! Another hack is to just track everything you eat today as yesterday's calories- makes it easier to stay on track! 😅
22/12/2024, 6:36 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Wat if i told u sometimes i do this 🤡
22/12/2024, 6:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,
How many calories in one date? 

Should we enter it as one date or grams entry would be better?

If in grams, how many grams for one date? 

I took two dates (different categories and sizes) at my sister's home, and couldn't weigh it.
22/12/2024, 6:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depends upon the size of the date k kitni calories hon gi 
 its better to weigh it & then enter
22/12/2024, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 60 calories per date on average
22/12/2024, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If I remember correctly
22/12/2024, 6:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's a solid strategy, honestly! But waking up the next day to see you've already logged 1,000 calories (or more) can feel overwhelming, esp. if you're stressed or not in the best headspace. That said, go with whatever works for you, as long as you're staying within your target
22/12/2024, 6:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes a date is like ~20g on avg. so 55-60 calories
22/12/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 1000 🥲 hahahaa i do 200 300 only 🤡
22/12/2024, 6:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: I know those big, chocolatey, chewy ones like medjool dates can have over 100-120 calories each
22/12/2024, 6:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha you're good then 😆
22/12/2024, 6:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Coated with chocolate and filled with nuts :p
22/12/2024, 6:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: No no, just the plain medjool date  (pitted) with no chocolate or nuts haha
22/12/2024, 6:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I do that too. Hahaha. When i have dhood patti  cravings before sleep. Hehe
22/12/2024, 6:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Oh I see. Hahaha
22/12/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Oh my god, one was medjool I think which I had and was large in size. I just googled it. Easily 100-120 cal. 🥺
22/12/2024, 7:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's okay, it's got loads of vitamins and minerals! 
And it tastes delicious
22/12/2024, 7:28 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923343773307 when will you announce the result for the magnum quiz? 🤔
22/12/2024, 7:29 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Wait what there was a quiz ? 🌚
22/12/2024, 7:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha I put up a poll 2 days ago
22/12/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Sorry poll
22/12/2024, 7:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay so,1 magnum classic, extra dark chocolate topping and 30g (of sprinkles and crushed oreo)
~420-450 calories! (overestimated a bit cause of the extra chocolate topping)
22/12/2024, 7:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Who all got it right? 👀
22/12/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Let me just put the answer now 👀😂
22/12/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I overestimated and put 450

Hahahah
22/12/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Aray just 450 cal. I thought it was 550-600. Phr Tou hum easily khaa sakty. 😂

22/12/2024, 7:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I got choc sprinkles calories by googling. Est 10g I think. Oreo biscuits are my fav snack so I know 4 of those are 130. I estimated the choora on top accordingly. Rest was easy. Magnum classic. One dip and two toppings <This message was edited>
22/12/2024, 7:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly!! You can easily have one of these everyday if you make smart food choices (hit your protein first) 😎
22/12/2024, 7:36 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
My personal fav 😍
22/12/2024, 7:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yeah, simply just Magnum.
No worms coating hehehe

22/12/2024, 7:38 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Why you want to waste magnum🤯
22/12/2024, 7:39 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Idk why i never found this brand in stores
22/12/2024, 7:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Experiment 🤷🏻‍♀️
22/12/2024, 9:40 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How do we ever track endless shadi ki dawatein that too buffetS
22/12/2024, 9:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's tricky! If it's just one event, I'd make the effort to track it. If it's multiple, I'd skip tracking entirely but still stay intentional. Focus on high-protein options, take smaller portions of everything you want to try, and eat mindfully and slowly. Incorporate veggies wherever possible and remember, the goal isn’t to fill your plate or your tummy- - it's to enjoy the food in moderation!

Treat "shaadi ka khaana" as an experience, not a calorie bomb. Eating to taste (not excess) allows you to enjoy without the guilt. 

Also, check out my comment on Aysha's recent post on FB; it has tips for navigating the festive season without rigidity while staying aligned with your long-term health goals! :)
22/12/2024, 9:46 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I knew you might have  overestimated it a bit so put in 450!!
22/12/2024, 9:47 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Yea
Tracking gets overwhelming but thank you for the guide 🤍
22/12/2024, 9:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is why my goal in December was usually just to maintain weight when on a diet. 

Makes life easier and shifts focus to other aspects of health too. 

Like making sure I’m still nailing my workouts. 

Getting protein in. 

Focusing on sleep and all. 

Plus the small break from a deficit can help improve workout performance and even help you psychologically if you’ve been dieting for a while. 

Basically a DIET BREAK.
22/12/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Diet pe ainge to diet break lainge na 😂
22/12/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Pehle mein deficit to maintain karon
22/12/2024, 10:18 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Hi.. to track beef karahi.. what would be the best way? Beef in grams
And oil? And which entry for beef will be best.. minced beef?
22/12/2024, 10:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: ✨

My goal is to be in deficit for at least three months without measuring weight and scaling. I have to tune in myself for the deficit first. 

I do focus on daily calories, but weekly deficit goals are my priority.

And I'm enjoying the results like good sleep, less cravings, mindful food choices and somehow well  stressed management (overeating). 

Today I had a paratha (61gm, 2.5 tsp desi ghee) after so many days. And still 521 calories are in my pocket. Hehehehe
22/12/2024, 10:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: Your strategy is solid in focusing on the weekly deficit and the benefits like better sleep, mindful choices, and reduced cravings - this is a huge win for overall wellbeing! 

But do you mind if I share another perspective?
22/12/2024, 10:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're tracking it before cooking then everything can be tracked in grams.
If you're tracking cooked food, then yes, beef in grams, and oil you'll have to guesstimate. 
If you've got a picture of your food, share it with us and we'll tell you how much beef and oil it might have.
22/12/2024, 10:53 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Ok i was planning to cook beef karahi today.. I will share the picture
22/12/2024, 10:54 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I would love to hear that too.. I am also following more or less same
Strategy but got a little demotivated lately

22/12/2024, 11:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Never mind. Please share. <This message was edited>
22/12/2024, 11:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay, so while your strategy may be good for you, without tracking weight or body girth measurements, it can be a bit like driving without a speedometer or maps. The feedback from weight or girth measurements helps fine-tune your plan.

When your progress plateaus (as it naturally will in a deficit) after you reach a certain number, you’ll need data to adjust your calories or macros. Without that data (bodyweight/body girth measurements), you might end up guessing, which could slow progress or lead to frustration and may affect your food choices, etc., too. So think of the measurements as a tool- not a judgment- just feedback to see if your actions align with your goals or not and you can make adjustments in your approach based on this feedback.

If you’re nervous about regular weigh-ins, even bi-weekly or monthly tracking can be helpful. That way, you get the benefits of hard data without obsessing over daily fluctuations.

Let me know if it makes sense or not! 🙏🏽

22/12/2024, 11:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Of course it makes sense. 

I might be nervous about weigh-ins. It can be one of  the reasons because whenever I tried to lose weight, I ended up with that plan after a month. Lol. 
I just want to be consistent with food/calories thingy first. 

But you are right weigh-ins monthly can help in. ✨

Thank you! 😊
22/12/2024, 11:29 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Makes sense totally.. and you are right and i checked my scale recently and there was very little change.. so yeh i did measurements there was very little Change in that too..
22/12/2024, 11:30 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: So regular weigh ins do give a better idea

23/12/2024, 1:13 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And how many calories in sweet popcorn . Cineworld  ones
23/12/2024, 1:17 am - Taha Ahmed: It's your choice! You can have it if you want 😊
23/12/2024, 1:18 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: The damage had been done🙈 but will watch out for the day
23/12/2024, 1:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 800-900 easily. 

Larger can be higher. Around 1200-1500
23/12/2024, 1:19 am - Taha Ahmed: Salted Popcorn: Small/Regular: Around 300–600 calories
Sweet (Caramel) Popcorn: Typically higher in calories due to added sugar and coatings:
Small: Approximately 250–400 calorie & Large: Around 800–1,200 calories​
23/12/2024, 1:20 am - Taha Ahmed: It really varies because different places have different serving sizes also!
23/12/2024, 1:23 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Salted popcorn has high calories too ????
23/12/2024, 1:23 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Goodness....
23/12/2024, 1:24 am - Taha Ahmed: It's made with butter/oil na! 
Unless you get butter-free ones, that's diff!
23/12/2024, 1:24 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I thought It was a healthy choice
23/12/2024, 1:24 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was not aware of the butter part
23/12/2024, 1:25 am - Taha Ahmed: It's the secret sauce haha
23/12/2024, 1:25 am - Taha Ahmed: It is fine!

23/12/2024, 1:37 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: @923343773307
23/12/2024, 1:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s much less. 

Rice 100-120g
Potato 50g
Chicken 70-80g
Oil 2tsp
23/12/2024, 1:41 am - PF - Nida Umer: Rice def not 200g
23/12/2024, 1:44 am - Taha Ahmed: Another quick hack for tracking food at dawats or shaadi dinners: (you don't need to carry your kitchen scales haha 😂)

Measure in tablespoons!
1 tbsp = ~15g (works great for rice, pasta, etc.).
For example, 8 tbsp of rice = ~120g.

It’s not super precise, but it’s a handy way to stay mindful of portions without stressing over exact measurements. 
Guesstimates > no estimates, right?

You can thank me later! 🙏🏽
23/12/2024, 1:44 am - PF - Nida Umer: Awesome

Coaches please help pre plan my day

I have had just a coffee since i woke up. How can i maintain a balance
24/12/2024, 12:14 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Happy Anniversary 🎉.
We have a rule not to count calories on birthdays and anniversaries 😅
24/12/2024, 12:14 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Lol
I think i abused that rule in the last couple of days coz of shadi season n overseas family
24/12/2024, 12:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: STK-20241224-WA0001.webp (file attached)
24/12/2024, 12:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): First of all happy anniversary

Now if i have an event to attend what i do for myself is i take just protein in my breakfast and lunch to save carbs from both meals for dinner thats how i have got more room to enjoy food without thinking much about going beyond my caloric intake 
or even if you do go abit higher than your caloric intake its just fine for a day
24/12/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you Ali
24/12/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ok will try doing that iA
24/12/2024, 1:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey happy anniversary! 

Don’t stress about the calories today, like Ali said - we don’t count them on birthdays and anniversaries! It’s just one day, so enjoy it guilt-free.

That said, if you feel like you’ve been leaning on this rule a bit much because of shaadi season, it might help to reassess your goals for the week or two, or until this ends. Focus on maintaining until the festivities are over, and then shift back to weight loss. Trying TOO HARD to stay in a deficit when it’s unrealistic can just drain your energy and will make you go crazyyyy. Don't do that please! 
And take it easy!

24/12/2024, 1:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes addressing it in a detailed post will help other members too
24/12/2024, 1:52 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Well it's been a week... I just can't stop myself from eating junk....here and there!

I hate weddings btw! But these are fun because of friends
24/12/2024, 1:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Anything for true friends anytime !!

24/12/2024, 4:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923330277703 I’d love to hear more about it in detail so make a post on FB soon! And tell us what’s influencing these food choices? What’s your environment like? Are you reaching for these foods because you’re hungry, bored, or maybe trying to cope with a feeling you haven’t fully acknowledged yet? Could it be a way to mask something deeper that’s happening?  

Also, are you buying these foods every day, or are they just easily available at home? Share as much detail as you can, and we’ll be able to understand better and guide you accordingly. 😊
24/12/2024, 4:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: I totally agree with her!

We really need to practice this consistently to rewire our brains and start thinking and doing things differently from how we’ve been taught or how we’ve always done them. It takes effort, but it’s worth it!

And I think I have said on both WhatsApp and FB! :p
24/12/2024, 4:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: @966593000250 there you go! :))
24/12/2024, 4:37 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923330277703 I'm looking forward to this post too. I'm sure I could also benefit and learn a thing or two as well 🙌🏼
24/12/2024, 4:38 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thank you ❤️
24/12/2024, 4:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Pls do share the link of that post (details) here. We all face these factors more often.
24/12/2024, 4:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I was talking to my therapist this morning and I told her about the things you mentioned we should implement as well as explore the underlying hidden/reason emotion that could be causing issues. My particular problem is I tend to "inhale" (insert I'm speed meme) food and I dislike that a lot (tend to overeat sometimes as well as not enjoy food properly). I was unable to resolve it myself so I realised I NEED help doing it.

When we explored the underlying reasons, it started to make so much more sense and now I'm better equipped to deal with my problem. ❤️
24/12/2024, 4:50 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Omg
Same!!
24/12/2024, 4:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: In a parallel universe, I’m totally a therapist - like the cool kind who hands out snacks (read: high protein snacks) and memes as coping tools. But in this universe, I’ll just drop wisdom and pretend I have a degree in emotions. Hhaha😂

And yes, understanding the underlying reason/emotion/driving force before behind our behaviors/actions give so much clarity that we won't get through surface level stuff. Glad you're making breakthroughs though, keep me posted, because your wins are my wins too! ❤🙏🏽

24/12/2024, 5:40 pm - PF - Sawera Shamshad: What about stress driven eating? And that too when the stress is unavoidable and totally self imposed!
24/12/2024, 5:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Looks heavenly
24/12/2024, 6:20 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Hello
I just joined yesterday
Im having excessive/binge eating problem
Are u talking abt that?
24/12/2024, 6:20 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Is there anyone else in the same boat
24/12/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Hi there. Yes there are other people facing similar issues. I'm sure they can share their experiences and the coaches will also guide you.

I was actually talking about scarfing down food and how I'm dealing with it.
24/12/2024, 6:37 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Try using the search feature on the Project FoMo Facebook page and you might find relevant info there
24/12/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I want to start by saying there’s been some great advice shared here around choosing food alternatives, etc. But honestly, what truly matters is understanding why these patterns of eating happen in the first place. I'm going to share what I think about it and is not an advice of a therapist. 

You mentioned an example of finishing the chocolate because you don’t want others to have it before you - it's a thought process that can easily turn into a cycle of urgency and guilt around food (I've done that too, and I'd to work on it by constantly telling myself that I don't have to eat it all and that I can eat more tomorrow. The world's not going to end tonight). And trust me, this is something so many people experience, often without realizing how much their emotions, environment, and past dieting behaviors influence it.

Our eating habits are rarely just about the food itself. Stress, lack of sleep, and even our past relationships with food play a massive role too. (I tend to often skip meals when I am stressed, and sometimes I finish bars of chocolate and not eat anything else, and now I am fully aware).

And yes, chronic stress can push us toward sugary or high-calorie foods as a coping mechanism (because it acts as a comfort food - more safety in choosing that because it makes us feel safe - your therapist must be talking about this with you already), and poor sleep disrupts the hormones that regulate hunger and fullness, making it harder to stop at "just one" piece of brownie or piece of chocolate. If you’ve dieted or restricted certain foods before, it’s natural for your brain to perceive these as "scarce resources", which can create urgency around eating them (what you do when you've the urge to finish before everyone else) - almost like you’re in survival mode. This is entirely normal and nothing to feel ashamed of, but it'd be helpful to have some mitigating strategies around this to help you overcome this behavior. 

What matters is shifting how we approach these habits. What you can do is,

1. Be mindful of these patterns and journal them when it happens (so it's just not in the unconscious anymore and by doing so, you make it more real)
2. Remove judgement around the food... there's no food that is "good" or "bad." Seeing it through a neutral lens can reduce guilt and allow you to enjoy what you eat mindfully
3. When cravings hit, take a moment to check in with yourself quickly. Ask yourself if you are physically hungry, or are you seeking comfort or distraction? Either response is okay, but knowing which it is helps you make more intentional choices
4. Having more structured and balanced meals with protein, fiber, and healthy fats can reduce those uncontrollable cravings because you'll be full for longer

5th and the most important... create an allowance in your daily dietary intake where you include these foods almost everyday, which can change your relationship with food over time, esp if you start operating from a not-so-scarce mindset.

For next time obviously.

How many calories would a salad have from evergreen.
25/12/2024, 3:39 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: The salad has some hummous and a shy amount of chicken.
25/12/2024, 3:47 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Evergreen has mentioned calories in most of their dishes
25/12/2024, 3:49 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: True. Hence i tried my luck here if somebody remembered. I got surprised with this food by my wife for lunch at home. So ive got no idea. Except that the whole pizza had 1200kcals. So im assuming 300kcals in 2 slices and around 200 in the salad?
25/12/2024, 3:50 pm - PF - Farah Salman: U can chek their menu on their insta page <This message was edited>
25/12/2024, 3:50 pm - PF - Farah Salman: None of their food is 200ish cals

Im sure salad with hummus must b around 400ish cals <This message was edited>
25/12/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Oh yes i can do that.  Thankyou
25/12/2024, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Most of those are wrong lol
25/12/2024, 3:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think it has 6 slices in total. So each slice is 200. But the calories aren’t accurate so I personally just use va standard domino type entry
25/12/2024, 4:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So probably around 900-1000 total
25/12/2024, 4:02 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: And the salad sameet? Can you help me out on macro first? My calorie week chart is going good and i feel good too so i dont wanna mess it up.
25/12/2024, 4:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Does it have chicken? Or just vegetable ands and hummus?

25/12/2024, 8:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you weigh the bones too? Or is that a guestimate?
25/12/2024, 8:54 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I just weighed it like this.. this showed 275gm on scale
25/12/2024, 9:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's prob be 230gm cooked chicken breast boneless

25/12/2024, 11:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Another quick hack for tracking food at dawats or shaadi dinners: (you don't need to carry your kitchen scales haha 😂)

Measure in tablespoons!
1 tbsp = ~15g (works great for rice, pasta, etc.).
For example, 8 tbsp of rice = ~120g.

It’s not super precise, but it’s a handy way to stay mindful of portions without stressing over exact measurements. 
Guesstimates > no estimates, right?

You can thank me later! 🙏🏽

Please tell me that you are referring to this serving spoon (which is definitely not 15gms 🤣 ) a Tbsp 🫢 because if this is just 15 gm, we should all use this at homes too 😅

Used 3 tbsp pf soaked chia seed .. to add fibre intake.. good idea
Or bad? I feel my fibre intake is less when i focus on more protein
26/12/2024, 12:59 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Also how to track it
26/12/2024, 12:59 am - PF - Bismah Nayyer: I am aware of that. That was supposed to be a satire 😆 but on a serious note So we can track while we are eating and not when we are taking out the food on our plates. Another thing, how many tbsp are there in that serving spoon ?
26/12/2024, 1:02 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Shadiyo wala khana more than 8 years now nahi khaya 😟
26/12/2024, 1:03 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Mujhy ek chez pochni hai like in my teen i was always 45-50 kg i eat everything eat a lot like any time late night eating junk food in uni days as well why weight was same 😩
26/12/2024, 1:03 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Ab to hawa b lagti hai🫨
26/12/2024, 1:04 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Sighhh so relatable
26/12/2024, 1:07 am - PF - Asma Tariq: You get chia seeds entry in the App. 
I used to weigh chia seeds before adding water or milk.
26/12/2024, 1:10 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I can't stop laughing on the above spoon thingy. #Shadditable
26/12/2024, 1:12 am - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Thank you for getting it !!
26/12/2024, 1:12 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Yeh i think that is better.. measure before soaking
26/12/2024, 1:15 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha 😂, well yes, it's not a perfect solution ofc, but this approach can help you estimate your food intake more accurately when weighing isn't an option. By tracking what goes on your plate (in tbsp), you can maintain some control and reduce guilt, especially when dining out or during the shaadi season.

For instance, you might have 6 tbsp of biryani rice, you can log it as ~6tbsp/~90g rice in MFP etc... the focus here isn't on perfection so don't worry too much about if it was half a tbsp or a heaping tbsp.

The idea is to make tracking more manageable and less stressful, so you can enjoy your meals with peace of mind, esp when you'd rather not track anything and feel guilty later. 🤷🏽‍♂

And that big spoon has probably 5-6tbsp (depends on how much you're filling it up)!
26/12/2024, 1:17 am - Taha Ahmed: It's a good thing for sure, but chia seeds has a lot of calories, like 1tbsp = ~80 kcals
3tbsp chia seed = 240 kcal

And just choose chia seed in your tracking app and add ~45g/or 3tbsp
26/12/2024, 1:19 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Yeh I just realized it .. it has a lot of calories lol
26/12/2024, 1:20 am - Taha Ahmed: You probably weren’t eating enough (in a surplus), which is why your weight didn’t increase. Or maybe your physical activity was higher, keeping you at maintenance calories.  

Energy balance is the only explanation here!
26/12/2024, 1:22 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Omg 80 cal khamkha main 😭
26/12/2024, 1:23 am - Taha Ahmed: And now your physical activity has probably decreased, meaning you’re not moving as much. If you’ve tried losing weight before but weren’t eating enough protein and were exercising, you might have lost muscle mass, which could have lowered your BMR (the calories your body needs to maintain its current weight).

On top of that, if you’re now eating enough to put yourself in a calorie surplus, that’s why you’re gaining weight. Maybe earlier your food choices weren’t as calorie-dense, and now they are, which might explain why it feels like even hawa is making you gain weight, lol! 😅

26/12/2024, 1:24 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: That’s v v true thanks 😓
26/12/2024, 1:25 am - PF - Marium Hamza: Does that mean that age does not play a part in gaining weight or it goes down slowly as you age?
26/12/2024, 1:25 am - Taha Ahmed: It's not Khamkha - its got fiber, good fats and tons of other nutrients. That's why it's calorie dense also!
26/12/2024, 1:28 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: But it’s nothing for tummy 😅
26/12/2024, 1:29 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: And for informational purposes asking .. how does gall bladder removal change your metabolism? Or it doesn’t change it? I have a gall bladder surgery planned soon..
26/12/2024, 1:31 am - Taha Ahmed: The role of age in weight gain or loss is often overstated. While aging does lead to some changes in our body, the primary factor isn't age itself- it’s lifestyle changes that tend to come with it. (kabhi apnay circle mai burhe/aged logon ko dekhna aap)

So then when we age, we generally become less active, which reduces our total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). For instance, the same amount of food that maintained your weight in your 20s could lead to weight gain in your 40s or 50s if you're not as active. This is a concern and a major issue.

Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) also declines slightly with age, but the change is quite small, like about 1-2% per decade. This roughly translates to around 30-40 fewer calories burned per day every 7-10 years, particularly for those who are sedentary. (that means barely any exercise, not eating enough protein, etc.)
26/12/2024, 1:33 am - Taha Ahmed: You know what helps? Staying active through resistance training and regular movement. This can minimize this effect and even help preserve muscle mass, which keeps your metabolism higher.

So, while age-related changes happen -inevitable stuff!, they’re not a major determinant of weight gain. It’s what becomes of our lifestyle. 🤷🏽‍♂
26/12/2024, 1:35 am - Taha Ahmed: Not necessarily.
No gall bladder = less fat digestion since bile is no longer stored and released as needed.
So your food make require some dietary adjustments, perhaps smaller, low-fat meals to ease digestion.
26/12/2024, 3:16 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: What should we eat for not constipated 😟
26/12/2024, 3:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: To save calories but still eating enough fiber.

There’s a solid hack. 

It’s called vegetables 🤣🤣
26/12/2024, 3:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And to an extent ispaghol
26/12/2024, 4:05 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Watermelon , palak , chickpeas , apple ,gobhi , broccoli and if nothing works .... 

Mirch walay kebab always works 🙊( it's a joke)
26/12/2024, 4:09 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Phir Roky ga nahi system ya Pakistan ka every trip 2 time hospitalise hota hai banda 🤣😘
26/12/2024, 4:09 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Yes u r right ill eat a lot of vegetables now

26/12/2024, 4:57 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: This one is on sale here..should I buy it? How is the taste?
26/12/2024, 4:58 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Last brand I tried was different and chocolate flavor.. it tasted blah 😑
26/12/2024, 8:03 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Activity levels
26/12/2024, 8:05 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Why i read this as good farts, i am cooked 😭😭
26/12/2024, 11:52 am - PF - Faraz Nafees: I just compared the entry for brown rice and white rice. Both have almost the same macros!? 😱
26/12/2024, 11:52 am - Taha Ahmed: Yup, pretty much
26/12/2024, 11:53 am - PF - Faraz Nafees: Then why is brown considered better?
26/12/2024, 11:54 am - PF - Faraz Nafees: Or is it?
26/12/2024, 11:59 am - PF - Farah Salman: Just becoz it has more fibre
26/12/2024, 12:00 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Same like brown bread and  white bread
Calories are pretty much same
26/12/2024, 12:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Brown rice isn’t much better than white rice when it comes to overall calories and macros, except for a tiny bit more fiber (~1g more per 100g serving). That’s pretty much it!  

Social media might hype it up as the "healthier" option, but it really just comes down to your preference. If you enjoy the taste and texture of white rice more like me, go for it!
26/12/2024, 12:00 pm - PF - Farah Salman: What would be the calories in a bowl of chicken Corn soup
Hot and sour soup
Served at chinese resturants?
26/12/2024, 12:01 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Thanks taha
26/12/2024, 12:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: It varies because everyone makes it differently. In this case I'd just pick any entry and add that
26/12/2024, 12:05 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Glucose spikes as well 😂
26/12/2024, 12:06 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: There's so much misinformation out there that all these things are slowly becoming facts
26/12/2024, 12:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Lol what about it? That brown rice doesn't spike your glucose so much? 👀
26/12/2024, 12:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
Can we track chicken tikka with this
26/12/2024, 12:16 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Cant find a bbq one with green tick
26/12/2024, 12:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good to me!
26/12/2024, 12:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did your tikka have a lot of oil?
26/12/2024, 12:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Maybe add 1tsp oil too? 
What say @923441183411
26/12/2024, 12:17 pm - PF - Nida Umer: No
Did it at home
26/12/2024, 12:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you didn't use oil then these macros are good
26/12/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Perfect
26/12/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you
26/12/2024, 12:21 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah thats what these "influencers" tell u <This message was edited>
26/12/2024, 12:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, 99.9% of these influencers are 🤡 and 💩
26/12/2024, 12:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: You deleted this message
26/12/2024, 12:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And unless you’re diabetic, the glucose spike DOES NOT MATTER.
26/12/2024, 2:28 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
Which entry?
26/12/2024, 2:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
I’d use one of these.
26/12/2024, 2:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Same
26/12/2024, 2:37 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): For any kind of fish?
26/12/2024, 2:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well depends. If you know the fish then just search for that particular fish.
26/12/2024, 2:47 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
This entry is okay for surmai fish
26/12/2024, 3:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes looks good
26/12/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Mushrooms ko track karna hota hai?
26/12/2024, 6:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: They don’t have many calories on their own unless they’re cooked or sautéed with butter, oil, etc. In that case, you’d only need to track the butter or oil used
26/12/2024, 6:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Or if you’re eating half a kilo of mushrooms - that’s when you’d need to track, as it would add up to around 100–120 calories
26/12/2024, 6:47 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Got it
26/12/2024, 6:47 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Thxx
26/12/2024, 7:11 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I recently used canned mushrooms. They had 24 calories per 100g. So its ok if we don't track it
26/12/2024, 7:12 pm - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Thanx ab omlate baut bara bany ga 
Mashrooms onion tomatos 😅😅

26/12/2024, 7:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,
There is something like rice laddu type which is called meethay laddu too, a tiny sized. How to track that? 

Probably made with rice flour and sugar ,and deep fried. I forgot to take a picture. 

Guide pls. I ate three. <This message was edited>
26/12/2024, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Deep fried so it’ll be high in calories.
26/12/2024, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any chance you can send a picture? Maybe from Google?
26/12/2024, 7:53 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Let me try
26/12/2024, 7:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
26/12/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe do 15g flour, 15g cooked rice and 1tsp oil per piece.
26/12/2024, 8:01 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Wheat flour or?
26/12/2024, 8:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any
26/12/2024, 8:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Right. 👍
Should I skip Sesame seeds?
26/12/2024, 8:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. That won’t be that high
26/12/2024, 8:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could add 2g per piece
26/12/2024, 8:09 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Done!
26/12/2024, 8:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 380 calories for 3 pieces, just snacking btw. 😢

My lunch was under 300 calories 😂 Yaar. Hahahah
26/12/2024, 8:19 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: The most important thing I learned from this program is to be responsible. At the start of the program, I thought I was eating in a deficit. I tended to ignore those extra calories, thinking that since I ate well all day, a small amount of junk wouldn't make a difference. In reality, it made all the difference.

I'm now also eating responsibly on weekends. I've realized that it's more important to watch my diet on rest days. During my first weekend after joining Project FOMO, I learned that calculating calories is the way to go. Previously, I would starve all day and have a huge meal on weekend nights, thinking it was still below my maintenance calories. But oh boy i was so wrong!
26/12/2024, 8:20 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Writing this made me crave for an icecream. Please suggest me a good low cal icecream 😂
26/12/2024, 8:22 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Are gelatos low in cal than icecreams?
26/12/2024, 8:23 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: <Media omitted>
This is how my day went. Suggest me what to do if im craving meetha thats under a 180kcals cz i wanna stay in a deficit.
26/12/2024, 8:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Jalebi. 😂
26/12/2024, 8:25 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: KitKat
26/12/2024, 8:26 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Icecream batao yaar!
26/12/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
For 2 fingers KitKat these are the calories
26/12/2024, 8:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): cornetto or magnum
26/12/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Cornetto 😂
26/12/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Magnum!? Really?
26/12/2024, 8:29 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: <Media omitted>
26/12/2024, 8:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 100g has 328 calories i guess 
i'm not sure how much does 1 bar weigh
26/12/2024, 8:31 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: How many grams is an individual magnum any idea?
26/12/2024, 8:31 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I looked it up and it says 75g per portion
26/12/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Pls see this.
26/12/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Can anyone confirm 😅
26/12/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Sara fanda in snacks ka hai 😭 banda roti  salan khaye bas Magr nahi humny snacks to her haal

26/12/2024, 8:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no idea

26/12/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: That is with toppings
26/12/2024, 8:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: See this.
26/12/2024, 8:33 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Fitscoop can be a good idea
26/12/2024, 8:33 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I can relate to this... I can ben n jerry in one sitting easily 😂
26/12/2024, 8:34 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
So i just did a little research for my curious mind.... One magnum classic will be between 60-70g and calories around 231 kcal
26/12/2024, 8:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): dont judge me for this but i have always leaned towards 2 icecreams , toblerone & hico's tuti fruiti
26/12/2024, 8:35 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Hico is premium quality
26/12/2024, 8:37 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I loved yummy... But it's not around anymore
26/12/2024, 8:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I miss that Panda ice cream. If someone remembers.  It was of Polka brand I guess before walls in Pakistan. <This message was edited>

26/12/2024, 8:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: One bar is 220-240
Depending on the flavor.
26/12/2024, 8:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Feast is also 200 something
26/12/2024, 8:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cornetto is 180-190
26/12/2024, 8:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Jet Sport is 50-60 🤣
26/12/2024, 8:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Usually a scoop of gelato is 240-300
26/12/2024, 8:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: McDonald’s ki cone is 170. 

Sweet Crème (better than McDonald’s) is also 170-200
26/12/2024, 8:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: @923332088830
26/12/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This is better 😂
26/12/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: <Media omitted>
I ended up with this
26/12/2024, 8:58 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: One more difference i have had after joining project FOMO
26/12/2024, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahaha yeh bhi theek hai as long as you don’t mind the price.

26/12/2024, 9:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It mentions the calories in the packet.
26/12/2024, 9:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add any packaged juice like nestle. <This message was edited>

26/12/2024, 9:44 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Before joining FoMo:
• I wasn't active but now I am able to complete my 10,000 steps easily.I used to think that I had my workout done so my job is done for the day but now I try to be active whole day and i feel more energized.
• I used to have a bowl full of lentils/haleem  without knowing that it contained carbs/fats too.
• Now I am  losing weight(4-5kg)while enjoying my meals I have lost inches as well and I am fitting in  old tight clothes again.
• ⁠In start my family kept telling me that i will not loose weight by eating carbs but now they are also appreciating me.
• I feel confident in myself ever since I've joined this community.
• I used to keep my weekends as cheat days but now I am free to eat as I want, and at any day I want.
• I used to overeat at weekends or gatherings but now i know my boundaries and best part thing is that i m fully satisfied and i don’t feel hungry all the time or crave anything.

•If i were not a part of this community i would have been wasting money on random diet plans from which i used to get bored and often skip my meals as i would not feel like cooking something special for myself.

Thanks to @923343773307 @60193244266 @923441183411 for helping me bring a positive change in my life.
26/12/2024, 10:35 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Also i wanted to ask that i was not doing any workout or  i was not active as i was having vertigo..
I wanted to ask if i should start doing strength training or cardio although i haven’t fully recovered yet but i want to do something to be active

Does this entry look fine for a paratha roll? I had half
27/12/2024, 12:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): carbs n fats to theek lg rhy but if it had chicken then protein 6g sy zada e honi hai
27/12/2024, 12:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Waisay I once tracked it. 

A standard Karachi paratha roll is 450-500.
27/12/2024, 12:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ya Allah
27/12/2024, 12:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So this can work for half. But probably protein thora zaada hoga
27/12/2024, 12:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a deep fried paratha lol
27/12/2024, 12:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: To yeh adhe roll k barabar hi hua😂

27/12/2024, 12:10 pm - PF - Nida Umer: My mouth is literally watering right now😂🙈
27/12/2024, 12:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Islamabad rolls are a disgrace if you’re from Karachi lol
27/12/2024, 12:11 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Hahahhahha

27/12/2024, 12:11 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Roll corner used to be the best in Bahadurabad area if anyone has ever tried
27/12/2024, 12:13 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Aina wadda Paratha roll. 😂
27/12/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Ya Allah reham

27/12/2024, 12:20 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Gunah be lazzat
27/12/2024, 12:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Islamabad ma paratha roll is literally a disgrace
27/12/2024, 12:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I once had a roll that had salan in it in Islamabad hahaha.
27/12/2024, 12:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And cabbage
27/12/2024, 12:29 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Can u plz share this information with me?
The one u have tagged

27/12/2024, 12:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): hahahaha

27/12/2024, 12:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Okay so,1 magnum classic, extra dark chocolate topping and 30g (of sprinkles and crushed oreo)
~420-450 calories! (overestimated a bit cause of the extra chocolate topping)

This?
27/12/2024, 12:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Classic magnum is 110ml/ ~79g serving
27/12/2024, 12:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Hi,  I hope this entry is right for Layers Nutella cake?
I weighed the piece (67gm).
27/12/2024, 12:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It won’t be accurate but can be a decent estimate.
27/12/2024, 12:53 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Should I overestimate the calories then? Guide pls because I have to be a bit strict in calorie intake for the rest of the days for this week.
27/12/2024, 1:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think 302 calories for a 67g slice of Nutella cake sounds fine. You can just round it up and say you ate 70–75g 🤷🏽‍♂️ -a safe overestimation!

27/12/2024, 7:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s easily more than 1500 calories.

28/12/2024, 10:51 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Around 450 to 500 calories?
28/12/2024, 10:52 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Andazay ki tracking theek hai?
28/12/2024, 11:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Chicken looks more like 70g tho.

28/12/2024, 5:34 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I am going on a dawat tonight
the menu is going to be thai curry and rice
how do I eyeball so that I eat around 500 cals in my plate?
28/12/2024, 6:00 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Same case for me. If i have got around 800-900 kcals remaining for the day and i just have haleem as my dinner option, how much approx am i supposed to eat if i dont have a weigh scale?
28/12/2024, 7:24 pm - PF - Farah Salman: <Media omitted>
No calories mentioned..how to calculate plz?
28/12/2024, 7:43 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: @60193244266 For such things, maybe we can use AI’s help?
28/12/2024, 7:44 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Taking a picture and then asking AI to guesstimate
28/12/2024, 7:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could. AI won’t be accurate though. Especially with meals such as Haleem and Thai Curry.
28/12/2024, 7:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But it can give you a good ballpark.
28/12/2024, 7:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: A guide to eyeball these things would be helpful @60193244266 @923343773307
28/12/2024, 7:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: At get togethers, it can be difficult to say No and still stick to the plan
28/12/2024, 7:56 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Maybe not specific dishes but like eyeballing quantities of pulao, biryani, salans etc.. usual things at a dawat
28/12/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s something you will have to learn with time. And that’s why we recommend tracking when at home
28/12/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just like she was able to ballpark it because she’s been tracking now
28/12/2024, 8:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So when you’ve taken out 300g of cooked rice a few times you can then roughly look at a plate and ballpark it better. 

The same way I can lift a suitcase and ballpark how many kgs it is. 

Comes really handy before flights. 

Haven’t ever been wrong yet (past 6 years) 🤣
28/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Help plz?
28/12/2024, 8:03 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Makes sense
28/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Pizza cheese is mozzarella mostly
28/12/2024, 8:05 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Ok
So will search for Mozarella on my fitness pal
28/12/2024, 8:05 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Thx
28/12/2024, 8:07 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Wait for coaches 😊
28/12/2024, 8:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Not a bad suggestion.
28/12/2024, 9:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Same case here. At BBQ night (Family). 
It's so tough to weigh and refuse. Lol.

AI suggestion is a good way for just a rough estimate.  👍
28/12/2024, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: BBQ is easy though. A tikka is 200g chicken. A boti is usually 30-40g
28/12/2024, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Seekh kebab is 80-100
28/12/2024, 10:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes. Thanks!
28/12/2024, 11:11 pm - PF - Amna Awais: @60193244266 @923343773307 
Aap aise hi or mazeed hacks b share kijiye ga plz
Jb hum dine out krain to mindful ho k kha skain k overeating nhi hui 
Jesai @923343773307 ne rice hack b share kia hai
28/12/2024, 11:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): the hack i use & you can use too is that fill your plate with protein first then a serving of carbs n veggies
Protein as you know is more satiating so if you have more of it then it will be less likely to overeat
28/12/2024, 11:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Sabroso niblets weight for 1 piece. Any guesses?
28/12/2024, 11:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
One piece of it. Estimated weight or entry in App?
28/12/2024, 11:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u can use chicken wings entry for this 1
28/12/2024, 11:56 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Done 👍

29/12/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That looks great.
29/12/2024, 8:26 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: It does
29/12/2024, 8:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just track it on estimate if you don’t want to weigh it.

29/12/2024, 9:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yum. This looks really good!
Also quite tummy friendly for sure
29/12/2024, 9:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think we did it once here
But it varies a lot so it's better to eye ball portion and then guesstimate the numbers
Esp cause every serving is also different <This message was edited>
29/12/2024, 9:05 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Do you remember the estimates for the one plate? Like if you can share a range.
29/12/2024, 9:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think 350-500 is a good range.
29/12/2024, 9:08 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Thank you.

30/12/2024, 1:11 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Do we have to account for Oil used in a tikka?
30/12/2024, 1:28 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Total cal ~ 582 (all entered in App as below)

It's estimated weight. Please guide, is it fine or should i add more weight?

Chicken seekh kabab ~ 90gm (entry as grilled chicken)

Tikka boti ~ 40+40 = 80gm (entry as grilled chicken) 

Karahi ~ 40gm (cooked chicken) + 2tsp oil

Raita ~ 25gm yogurt

Half afghani naan, not roghni ~ 188 cal
30/12/2024, 1:30 am - Taha Ahmed: Ideally, yes, but it also depends on how much tikka you had and how much oil was used
30/12/2024, 1:30 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Take-out Tikka

30/12/2024, 1:32 am - Taha Ahmed: All's good!

Seekh kebab = 70gm (cooked)
Tikka boti = ~20-25ish gm = total 50gm
Chicken karahi = also 30ish gm + 1tsp oil

Total oil = 3tsp (including karahi + seekh kebab + tikka boti) <This message was edited>
30/12/2024, 1:33 am - Taha Ahmed: How much did you have? 
1 seekh tikka boti can easily have 2 tsp oil
30/12/2024, 1:35 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: A leg piece.
30/12/2024, 1:35 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Thanks!

And I mistakenly responded to your reply to Haris. 🙂
30/12/2024, 1:35 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: I think that’s around 200g?
30/12/2024, 1:35 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes. It's around 220-250ish gm (raw + with bones) and easy 2tsp oil (esp if it was a takeout) <This message was edited>
30/12/2024, 1:36 am - Taha Ahmed: I literally just had some tikka and it was loaded with oil idk why (3tsp aaram se tha usmei)
30/12/2024, 1:36 am - Taha Ahmed: And I ate 1 leg tikka and 1 chicken breast tikka 🙊
30/12/2024, 1:37 am - Taha Ahmed: No worries! :)
30/12/2024, 1:38 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: so raw around 125cals?
30/12/2024, 1:38 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: and add another 100 cals for a tbsp of oil
30/12/2024, 1:40 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: <Media omitted>
30/12/2024, 1:41 am - Taha Ahmed: Atleast ~350 kcal for a 220-250g raw, bone-in chicken thigh/leg piece +90 kcal (2tsp oil); total 440 kcal
30/12/2024, 1:41 am - Taha Ahmed: But this doesn't look like its even 200g :O
30/12/2024, 1:43 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Might be 150g raw

30/12/2024, 1:43 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: But can’t stay.. how much can it shrink?
30/12/2024, 1:44 am - Taha Ahmed: Upto 30% (depending on how long it's cooked for)
30/12/2024, 1:45 am - Taha Ahmed: So if it was raw 100g, after cooking, it'd be 70-75g
30/12/2024, 1:45 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: To be safe 20% can be added to cooked weight?
30/12/2024, 1:46 am - Taha Ahmed: Yup
30/12/2024, 2:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Generally, I record all tikka in the same way. 

200g chicken breast or thigh and 2tsp oil. 

The deviance will be 20g or so either way and averages out over time.
30/12/2024, 2:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: A client weighed her leg tikka today and it was 173. 

Remove 30g-40g or so of bones and then account for the water weight lost by multiplying it by 1.35. 

This came out to 190g. 

Accurate? Yes. 

But I was off by 10g without tracking it on a scale. And 10g isn’t going to make or break your results. At least not in chicken. 

Peanut butter is a different story lol.
30/12/2024, 2:22 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Makes sense
30/12/2024, 2:22 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Thank you
30/12/2024, 2:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: even though J am above 100 cals on my day 1
30/12/2024, 2:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: i am so hungry
30/12/2024, 2:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine. It takes a few days to get used to it and 100 calorie isn’t even that much to worry about. It’s likely still a deficit. Just slightly smaller one
30/12/2024, 2:46 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: I think I need to add more volume to food.
30/12/2024, 2:46 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Veggies
30/12/2024, 3:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Always works
30/12/2024, 9:50 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hy coaches, so today I am going on 2 day trip where mostly I’ll eat outside.I expect some useful tips from the coaches to eat mindful and within my calorie limit.@923343773307 @60193244266
30/12/2024, 9:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 2 days won't make much of a difference bro so just chill kro enjoy kro trip n food
Prioritize protein intake eat mindfully & try to get in as much steps in as possible to maximize activity levels.
if you see an increase in scale weight post trip that will be water weight primarily because to gain an actual pound of fat u need to eat ~3500 calories more than your maintainance so relax krna you wont be eating that much i suppose
Just try to get back to routine once you return from the trip & you will be fine

30/12/2024, 2:49 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Does anyone know how much calories is in malai boti? Did anyone calculate it before?
30/12/2024, 2:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depends upon the quantity 
for 100g malai boti u can log it as 85-90g chicken breast 10-15g cream 1.5tsp oil
30/12/2024, 2:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: malai boti is usually chicken thigh
30/12/2024, 2:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: more fatty
30/12/2024, 2:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: no?
30/12/2024, 2:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hain? It’s usually breast waisay
30/12/2024, 2:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But you can look it as thigh too.
30/12/2024, 2:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Difference is going to be pretty small.
30/12/2024, 2:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): han na mjy bhi yehi pta tha
30/12/2024, 2:59 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: O, in Lahore it’s usually thigh boneless.
30/12/2024, 2:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then log it as thigh. No issues.
30/12/2024, 3:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For 100g malai boti, I usually just do 100g cooked chicken thigh, 2 tsp oil
1-2 cream.

30/12/2024, 6:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent. Yup.
30/12/2024, 6:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re probably 10 or so calories each.
30/12/2024, 6:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cause they have sugar I think.

30/12/2024, 7:23 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): they can be estimated.
30/12/2024, 7:24 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And when you have the estimatation you can manage it and even if it goes a bit up its just one day
30/12/2024, 7:25 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): To manage the extra oil calories i took half roti instead one and for snacks will go for something low calorie
30/12/2024, 7:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re homeless? Oh no 🤣🤣

For a person trying to loss fat and gain lean muscle is his main focus should be on tracking calories or should I also take care of sugar, oils and all?

Pie in the sky 30gms is 115 cals
60 and 115 such a big gap of number
30/12/2024, 8:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if your  goal is to get lean and build musxle then u need to be in a calorie deficit train hard eat enough protein rest well. After protein, carbs n fats ko as per your preference distribute kr skty ho aap within your calories 
moderate amount of oil n sugar use kr rhy ho to its fine
30/12/2024, 8:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if your are diabetic or insulin resistant ot if  its getting you into surplus then u need to take care of it else its fine
30/12/2024, 8:49 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I don’t think 30 grams will be 115 cals
30/12/2024, 8:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): a medium bread slice is genrly 80ish calories so yea if its a small slice to itni calories hon gi

Unless it’s multigrain.

30/12/2024, 8:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be gluten.
30/12/2024, 8:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bro. Stop over complicating it. 

You have the numbers. Follow them.
30/12/2024, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If the primary goal is to build muscle then you ideally need a surplus. 

If you want to prioritize fat loss, then the deficit is needed.
30/12/2024, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can build some muscle in a deficit, for sure. But it’s not ideal.
30/12/2024, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pick a goal and work towards it.
30/12/2024, 9:00 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Gluten to wheat may bhi hota ha na
30/12/2024, 9:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can but it will take you longer than doing it around maintainance or slight surplus 
muscle building requires first enough growth stimulus through training then adequate protein intake with good rest and recovery

If you’ve already weighed the kernels and butter separately, it’s better to log them individually!

Can you please share some ways to minimise calorie intake during dine outs.
1. Apart from the holiday season - i usually have lot of dine outs over the weekend which kinda throws away my whole week coz i probably dont stay in a deficit 
2. When one is out for dinner and doesnt have healthier option say the whole family orders pizza or hot pot etc how to even reduce cals then - i give in n usually dont track and dont even reduce my portions - thats when the overeating also comes in

Any sort of guidance in this regard will be helpful
31/12/2024, 1:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Honestly, you still want to overestimate it even if you've not finished the whole thing or if there's butter left. What if it's not 100g butter but 150g? Hahaha. That's 600 extra calories! 😂 <This message was edited>
31/12/2024, 1:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: We have some guidelines for eating out, will share it in the Facebook group shortly :)
31/12/2024, 1:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: #2 will help me a lot as well.. also usually eating out day is my worst day because it allows my all-or-nothing binging mind to go crazy.
31/12/2024, 1:54 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: i usually come back home and eat another meal - for comfort
31/12/2024, 1:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: Let me share something for this
31/12/2024, 1:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: You deleted this message
31/12/2024, 1:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: You deleted this message
31/12/2024, 1:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Let us make a guide for this and share it in a day or two.

Thank you

These are 4 big with bone chicken karahi botis. Do you guess it would have a 100gm chicken breast raw for my entry?
31/12/2024, 2:48 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: 'Big' lol. Golden peices

Is this non stick pan safe to use? Or does it need replacement?
31/12/2024, 3:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ideally you should replace the pan because ub non-stick isko kaha nhi ja skta technically because the food will stick with it jahan sy coating damaged hai

31/12/2024, 3:40 pm - PF - Saadiah Vohra Qadir joined from the community
31/12/2024, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah should be 100-120g of chicken.
31/12/2024, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But use a chicken thigh entry instead
31/12/2024, 3:57 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: how would you account for Salaan @60193244266 ?
31/12/2024, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also once the coaching is damaged, it’s not ideal for health. 

So if you want to be safe and reduce risk of disease, I would change it.
31/12/2024, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d do 120g chicken thigh and 4tsp oil.
31/12/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: 4tbsp?!!! Even though u dried it all up?
31/12/2024, 4:16 pm - You removed PF - Fahad Ali

50g qeema cooked

How would I track it? Not sure about the Oil tracking
31/12/2024, 4:18 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 80g minced qeema but Oil is hard to guess
31/12/2024, 4:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 4tsp. Not tbsp.
31/12/2024, 4:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 50g cooked mince (beef or chicken) OR 67.5 raw mince. 

Add 2tsp oil
31/12/2024, 4:22 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: How did you estimate the oil @60193244266 ?
31/12/2024, 4:22 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Thankgod.
31/12/2024, 5:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just an estimate based on experience.

31/12/2024, 9:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Shallow frying a small 60g burger patty.  AI suggests that it can be 6g of oil or 15g
31/12/2024, 9:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: so I have added 15g to my log
31/12/2024, 9:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: sorry I ate it before taking a picture
31/12/2024, 9:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I was super hungry
31/12/2024, 10:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahaha
31/12/2024, 10:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can also be much much higher btw.
31/12/2024, 10:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just add 3tsp oil and fry in that usually or I’ll use a spray
31/12/2024, 10:16 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Well, apparently it was not exactly shallow fry and not exactly deep.
31/12/2024, 10:31 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: now what to track @60193244266 ?
31/12/2024, 10:31 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 60g chicken patty
31/12/2024, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just one patty
31/12/2024, 11:24 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Two
31/12/2024, 11:24 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 60g each
31/12/2024, 11:24 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: It was small
31/12/2024, 11:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 120g chicken and probably 5tsp oil

31/12/2024, 11:36 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: waisay I think irs better to break down the recipes during entry

31/12/2024, 11:36 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Pulao was about 100-120 gm rice with some protein here n there
31/12/2024, 11:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fine. The problem is I haven’t seen your plate so these are just numbers for me lol. 

But 800 calories is realistic is you were careful of your choices and intake.
31/12/2024, 11:59 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Holidays are over for me tomorrow. Gym is going to be closed (overexcitement mein already check kerliya 😬) but have intentions of a home workout and walk IA. 
Kal raat faluda thoonsnay kay baad went for a half hr walk in -2 weather.
Looking forward to renewing my tracking.

01/01/2025, 1:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Low fat cream cheese can work if you want a spread that’s lower in calories. 

Also has some protein

01/01/2025, 3:40 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 75g rice 
125-130g chicken leg without bone (1.5tsp oil)
80g seekh kebab (1tsp oil)
01/01/2025, 3:41 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: what about oil in rice? seems like kabuli
01/01/2025, 3:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yup it’s kabuli
01/01/2025, 3:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Then add 1.5tsp oil
01/01/2025, 3:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: I love that! And yes, a healthy lifestyle should never feel like a chore. The moment it starts to feel that way, it’s a sign something’s off! 😊 I’m sure most people in this community have developed that awareness by now.
01/01/2025, 3:44 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I thought it was chicken breast🫢

I didnt eat the full sour cream but tracked it anyways
01/01/2025, 4:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: It depends on your preference and workout type. For example, slow resistance training might be fine after eating, but HIIT on a full stomach could make you feel sick. Timing also varies - some people feel better with food, while others prefer working out fasted. Generally, a balanced meal with carbs and some protein 1-2 hours before works well for most. Experiment and stick to what feels best for you!
01/01/2025, 4:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it really depends how good is your digestion some need more time some need less but genrly an hour before is good time 
Opt for quick digesting carbs and 20-30g protein
01/01/2025, 4:21 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Thank you
01/01/2025, 4:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks fine but instead of omelet add the amount of eggs used for the omelet
01/01/2025, 4:24 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This is my personal recipe of an omellet Of 2 eggs
And this was also of two eggs

01/01/2025, 4:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Should i add more oil?

It'll have atleast 300+ kcal
01/01/2025, 6:43 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: lmao
01/01/2025, 6:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if its anhaar greek yogurt then yes this particular latel is incorrect. the actual macros are 
9g carbs 
12.5g fat
22.5g Protein
01/01/2025, 6:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: no its local made
01/01/2025, 6:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's probably Greek-style yogurt and not actual Greek yogurt, in that case protein will be low
01/01/2025, 6:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: https://www.homemadecopk.com/products/strawberry-flavoured-greek-yoghurt
01/01/2025, 6:53 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): okay phir to macros are most likely incorrect
01/01/2025, 6:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes
01/01/2025, 6:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, they've basically put a nutrition label just for the sake of it 🤡

01/01/2025, 6:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Don’t like it
01/01/2025, 6:55 pm - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: I am using Anhaar too. Label seems incorrect. What’s the solution? Stop using it or  make another entry?
01/01/2025, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can trust the big brands, but it’s always smart to put that nutritional knowledge you’ve learned here to good use too - double win! 😄
01/01/2025, 6:57 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: mcdonalds can be trusted
01/01/2025, 6:57 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: if u dont customize

01/01/2025, 6:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can create another entry or if the entry is available in MFP, use the option to edit/correct the label before adding it in your diary :)
01/01/2025, 6:58 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I have already consumed this greek yogurt and it was sweet
01/01/2025, 6:58 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I think 2 tbsp sugar hogi
01/01/2025, 6:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not necessarily
01/01/2025, 6:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They use sweeteners too.
01/01/2025, 6:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I used Anhaar Greek yoghurt daily for 3 years
01/01/2025, 6:59 pm - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: Suggest to me how many calories and macros it should have??

Plain Greek Yogurt; about 113g
@60193244266 @923441183411
01/01/2025, 7:01 pm - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: I've noticed that the sweetness level of Anhaar is comparable to Nestle full-fat yogurt, yet it appears to have higher sugar content. Could you explain this discrepancy?
01/01/2025, 7:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is fat free Greek yoghurt
01/01/2025, 7:02 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Right
01/01/2025, 7:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use what Ali recommended and move on.
01/01/2025, 7:02 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I think Chobani is also fat free
01/01/2025, 7:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Has both versions.
01/01/2025, 7:03 pm - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: Suggest correct nutritional info for this yogurt please?
01/01/2025, 7:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly. ✨ Big brands are not in budget sometimes. :p

Well, Things are very different in real world #food #fitness #Nutriention . Bohat hi bongay rahain hum. Lol.  I'm learning a new thing daily. 🌸

01/01/2025, 7:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I used what the label said. 

I used to have the plain one. If you’re having the flavored ones then add 3tsp sugar to be safe.
01/01/2025, 7:05 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: damn and this is unflavoured
01/01/2025, 7:07 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I am just going to log 350 and move on lol
01/01/2025, 7:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes in lahore n islamabad

Can someone help me estimate calories for this lasagna. The total weight is 160g.

Ingredients include Lasagna sheets (around 20g), minced beef, cheese and tomato sauce.
01/01/2025, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just find a lasagna entry for this and add 160g. 

When you search lasagna find an entry that’s somewhat average of all the ones you see. 

Not the highest. Definitely not the lowest one.

01/01/2025, 11:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Acc. to this, if you had 40g papri (nimco papri), that's 200 calories
01/01/2025, 11:03 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ohh uff
01/01/2025, 11:03 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Chalo atleast salad has negligible calories
01/01/2025, 11:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: True that!
But this is how you can pack on hundreds of calories without even knowing 🤷🏽‍♂
01/01/2025, 11:04 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Now I know!

Aloo meethi salan.
92gm almost.

Should I only track potatoes and oil?

70gm boiled potatoes and 1tsp oil is fine?
01/01/2025, 11:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s low in oil then 1.5tsp is fine.
01/01/2025, 11:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And yeah. Rest is pretty much just potatoes
01/01/2025, 11:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Done! 👍
02/01/2025, 12:54 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: In my salad I used less than one cucumber tomato and onion
02/01/2025, 12:54 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: so I am not counting it
02/01/2025, 12:54 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Also there was no oil
02/01/2025, 12:54 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Just papri 😂
02/01/2025, 12:55 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: This was my first salad salad intake after a looong time

02/01/2025, 5:09 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay thanks!
02/01/2025, 5:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think it also has peanuts or other nuts so do account for those too
02/01/2025, 5:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: There weren't any nuts, there were white beans that I measured
02/01/2025, 5:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Basically plated the meal and weighed each element
02/01/2025, 5:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh perfect. I’d suggest saving it in the app so next time if you eat this, you don’t have to weigh it. It’s already tracked and saved and you can just use that same entry.

Search by flavor. Each flavour has different calories and protein slightly.

Anything in this salad packet that needs tracking?
02/01/2025, 10:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Not really
02/01/2025, 10:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Guys are we not meant to be tracking uncooked veggies?
02/01/2025, 10:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t have to if it’s just 5-10 calories. 

You can if you want. You’re more accurate but the difference is likely too small to matter so even if you skip it won’t matter as such. 

Don’t do this with things like peas, potatoes, corn or other high calorie vegetables. 

This mostly works with leafy greens.

02/01/2025, 10:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use standard chicken entries. Not sure about the sabroso ones.
02/01/2025, 10:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: acha
02/01/2025, 10:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: let me check
02/01/2025, 10:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you weigh out the entire dish as 330g? Or was that just the chicken?
02/01/2025, 10:47 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: just chicken
02/01/2025, 10:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends what ice cream and how much you had
02/01/2025, 10:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just add cooked chicken thigh worth 300g. 30g or so will be bones.
02/01/2025, 10:48 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: <Media omitted>
the eff?
02/01/2025, 10:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This doesn’t look right lol. Try another one.
02/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Waisay it’s not too far off
02/01/2025, 10:50 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: I am not sure how to decribe but i think it had many calories... and i also ate a good amount😫
02/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think fat should be closer to 25. Protein is fine.
02/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Was it a scoop or what?
02/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A scoop is usually 250-300 calories.
02/01/2025, 10:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: <Media omitted>
02/01/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d just say have dinner now and be more mindful tomorrow. Can’t do much about it now.
02/01/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 300g cooked is almost 405g raw.
02/01/2025, 10:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: yea then cooked entry is fine
02/01/2025, 10:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: :/
02/01/2025, 10:52 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Swirls... and we had 3 ice creams .. 1 with molten lava  and coffee ice cream it was sundae i think we 5 people shared it.
02/01/2025, 10:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Also I added peas and didnt knew they were too high in cals
02/01/2025, 10:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: thought sabzi hogi low cals
02/01/2025, 10:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: stacked to 100 cals lol
02/01/2025, 10:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can’t really give you a number but estimate 500 calories and move on.
02/01/2025, 10:53 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 🫨
02/01/2025, 10:53 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Okay👍
02/01/2025, 10:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends how much you add. 100 calories isn’t a lot in the grand scheme
02/01/2025, 10:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100 calories would be like 130g of peas.
02/01/2025, 10:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s a lot of peas.
02/01/2025, 10:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This doesn’t have more than 30g
02/01/2025, 10:54 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: <Media omitted>
02/01/2025, 10:55 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Use grams

02/01/2025, 11:03 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Joining this group is the best decision of 2025 for me. Calorie counting accuracy has increased by ten folds. The shockers of the real calories in food helps a lot. I am so glad and thankful of the hands on approach by coaches.

03/01/2025, 8:38 am - PF - Farah Salman: If cooking with different/mixed pieces of chicken 
How to track them
03/01/2025, 9:38 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Should we track saag ? If yes as leafy greens or saag ?
03/01/2025, 9:38 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
.
03/01/2025, 10:33 am - PF - Sadia Subhan: Can we have protein shake empty stomach?
03/01/2025, 10:49 am - PF - Farah Salman: Also of raw chiken is frozen 
Does The wieght  changes?
Or 100 gm will be logged as 100 only
03/01/2025, 12:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: Weigh everything once before eating, and if there are bones, weigh them separately afterward. Subtract the weight of the bones from the total, and track the remainder as chicken thigh boneless
03/01/2025, 12:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, don't track saag as saag. Just track the oil in it
03/01/2025, 12:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, you can, as long as your stomach can tolerate it - there’s no right or wrong time for consuming a protein shake.
03/01/2025, 12:54 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: If we are going to make kofta or mince should we weight it raw or cooked?
03/01/2025, 12:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: It does change a bit but let's not complicate it for ourselves. Just track it as 100g
03/01/2025, 12:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can do both - whichever's feasible for you
03/01/2025, 12:55 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
03/01/2025, 12:55 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Ok, but just for information 
Does it reduce weight or increase
03/01/2025, 12:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Frozen means there’s ice on it (which adds water weight), so if you defrost it and remove that water, the chicken will definitely weigh less, now can't really be sure how much that would be; could be 5g or 15g 🤷🏽‍♂
03/01/2025, 12:57 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Okkk
03/01/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: What should the milk be called.. that we pakis get.. whole milk and then boil it... malai is separated.. and then? What is be called? Low fat?
03/01/2025, 2:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's whole milk and it's still got fat even after the large layer of malai is separated
03/01/2025, 2:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: So just track it as "whole milk fresh" just to be on the safe side <This message was edited>
03/01/2025, 2:12 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok👍
03/01/2025, 3:42 pm - PF - Nida Umer: VID-20250103-WA0008.mp4 (file attached)

03/01/2025, 3:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nice! What’s the scale saying now? Hopefully not something snarky like ‘one at a time, please.’ 😜
03/01/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Lololol
03/01/2025, 3:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Visa milgaya scale ko? 😂

03/01/2025, 3:55 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Mine does too 
M gonna write a long ass msg as soon as i get time 

Wait for it😂
03/01/2025, 3:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay, on a serious note, please share more about it in a Facebook post and tell us how it’s making you feel- even if the change is as small as -0.05kg!  

More than just seeing the number, I’m curious to hear about your feelings and experience, how you think you got here, and what really helped you along the way. So we can do more of that to get you to your long-term goal. :)
03/01/2025, 3:56 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Around 4.2 lbs lost since I started.
03/01/2025, 3:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s a good change nonetheless. Celebrate all wins, especially the small ones!!

You know the saying, *“Qatra qatra samundar banta hai”* - that applies perfectly here!
03/01/2025, 3:59 pm - PF - Nida Umer: On it

I’ll write just what u like
Long detailed feedback

03/01/2025, 4:07 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Entry for this bakery biscuit?
03/01/2025, 4:08 pm - PF - Amna Awais: @60193244266 @923343773307
03/01/2025, 4:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: Aap koi bhi fresh cream ki entry select kar sakti hain, as long as the serving size i.e. quantity/grams are correct, any entry is fine
03/01/2025, 4:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can track it as any chocolate chip biscuit
03/01/2025, 4:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 4:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: But yours is definitely smaller, so maybe add 0.75 serving of this medium cookie
03/01/2025, 4:16 pm - PF - Amna Awais: <Media omitted>
@923343773307 this will be okay?
03/01/2025, 4:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes! looks good
03/01/2025, 4:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: On Facebook please 🙏
03/01/2025, 4:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. Alternatively the olpers cream will have calories mentioned on the back too.
03/01/2025, 4:44 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Ok thanks

03/01/2025, 6:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for these quantities its fine
03/01/2025, 6:05 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok👍
03/01/2025, 6:06 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this entry fine for 2tbsp of chia seeds
03/01/2025, 6:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent but it’ll be more accurate if you do it in grams.
03/01/2025, 6:11 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I didn’t weight it
03/01/2025, 6:12 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: How many grams should i add for 2 tbsp?
03/01/2025, 6:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Now just add 2tbsp. 

Why aren’t you weighing things though?
03/01/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this fine for 110g kofta and 168g boiled chickpea
03/01/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 6:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent. For kofta you can also just use ground beef and add 110g.
03/01/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Should i aad the ingredients use in koftas. like tomatoes and onion
03/01/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I was in a hurry going for workout that’s why i forgot to weight it
03/01/2025, 6:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you dont have to add onions n tomatoes
03/01/2025, 6:30 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Oky

03/01/2025, 6:52 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I have 600 cals left for the day 
And a dinner at Cocochan

Coaches 
Need guidance
03/01/2025, 6:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: What's on the menu and what do you feel like having?
03/01/2025, 6:57 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Its a dawat
03/01/2025, 6:57 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I guess 2-3 variety of dishes
03/01/2025, 6:57 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I can eat everything sir😂🙈
03/01/2025, 6:58 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I know the protein in chinese is fried
03/01/2025, 6:58 pm - PF - Nida Umer: So thats already lot of cals
03/01/2025, 7:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not in every dish but yeah Chinese can be high in calories
03/01/2025, 7:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Pick whatever’s high in protein, focus on that, add more veggies, and eat slowly. Socialize, don’t stress about wasting food, and remember -you don’t have to finish it all.

You can easily manage a good amount of food within 600 kcal, and even if you go over by 200 kcal, that’s alright!
03/01/2025, 7:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And SOUPS.
03/01/2025, 7:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: ESPECIALLY clear soups can be super low in calories and great for filling you up.
03/01/2025, 7:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: What abt the hot n sour type
03/01/2025, 7:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: R they high cal too <This message was edited>
03/01/2025, 7:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Are Hobnob bread calories on the packet accurate or should I just add 20%?
03/01/2025, 7:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it's thick and got chilly oil, then yess!
If it's clear and liquidy, but got chilly oil, then yes!
If it's clear and got no chilly oil, then not so much!
03/01/2025, 7:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Should be okay.
03/01/2025, 7:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think the plain white/bran bread have more or less the same calories per 100g. Just weigh one slice and see how many grams it is and track it using any good bread entry in the app.

If it's got grains and seeds etc, then yes, it can be a bit tricky!
03/01/2025, 7:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay makes sense, thank you!
03/01/2025, 7:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hot n Sour is higher than clear soups like Thai soup or other similar ones. 

But not too high either. Has some protein too.
03/01/2025, 7:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How do i tell if it has chilli oil 
I mean it would show right🫣
Sorry for the dumb qs
03/01/2025, 7:07 pm - PF - Farah Salman: <Media omitted>
Low fat and full fat has same calories???
03/01/2025, 7:09 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: <Media omitted>
Does this seem right?
03/01/2025, 7:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: <Media omitted>
Or is this more accurate?
03/01/2025, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just the raw 100g beef (10-15% fat) has over ~250 kcals
If it's cooked with oil so it'll definitely have more calories.

Track the ingredients separately for more accuracy
03/01/2025, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, better^
03/01/2025, 7:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay thank you!
03/01/2025, 7:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: No. Low fat has barely any fat so definitely fewer calories than the full-fat version
03/01/2025, 7:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Tip: Search ground beef rather than minced beef when looking for beef entries.
03/01/2025, 7:16 pm - PF - Farah Salman: So the one ive shared is mentioned on the pack itslef
03/01/2025, 7:16 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I think the fullfat one shared up isnt accurate
03/01/2025, 7:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. If that’s the one on the pack then go for that
03/01/2025, 7:23 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Hey! I bought a baguette  from a bakery and took around 44grams of it. Is this entry correct. (Its freshly baked and no label as its from bakery)
03/01/2025, 7:23 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 7:23 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
03/01/2025, 7:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup, looks good!
03/01/2025, 8:04 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Does soya sauce and vinegar needs tracking?
03/01/2025, 8:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No not really
03/01/2025, 8:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not necessary in terms of calories
03/01/2025, 8:09 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: If i m going to eat frozen french fries, but airfried zero oil. Do i need go weigh it in frozen form or after airfrying it?
03/01/2025, 8:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Before airfrying it
03/01/2025, 8:10 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Thanks :)
03/01/2025, 8:12 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Which entry we would chose for that?
Boiled potato or raw potato?
03/01/2025, 8:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): raw potato
03/01/2025, 8:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Raw potato - unless it's one of those half-fried ready-to-cook french fries
03/01/2025, 8:15 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: I need to see the pack for it and then i will ask.
03/01/2025, 8:46 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: If half fried then?
03/01/2025, 8:46 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Mostly i use opa fries
03/01/2025, 8:47 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Are those half fried or raw?
03/01/2025, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Use the nutrition label at the back.
03/01/2025, 8:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re using ready made products and they have nutritional content mentioned then you can use those. 

Unless you feel it’s not accurate. But Opa is accurate so use the calories mentioned at the back.

What do you think how many calories are there? Considering it has zero oil and only 1tpspn of peri peri sauce which according to the label has 20 calories and this whole piece after airfrying it has 327.3 grams and the bone weight after eating is 121.1. how can i track this on app? Also these fries were pre cooked frozen and 100 grams of these have 161 calories i added them manually in the app.
03/01/2025, 10:33 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 205g chicken leg (only meat's weight)
looks 70-75g fries (~120 calories)
1tsp per peri sauce <This message was edited>
03/01/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I need guidance/tip.

I had work-off today so slept till Noon. Therefore (69g consumed) 31g protein is left in my today target. (1100 calories consumed) 500 calories are left too. I'm already filled for today.

What should I do?
 I'm consistently completing my calories and protein targets. <This message was edited>
03/01/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Give me your calories 😭
03/01/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: If only
03/01/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s one day so if you don’t feel like eating, it’s fine.
03/01/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Line main lagain please 😂
03/01/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I can use these for a full meal 🤤
03/01/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It's because I had protein rich breakfast/lunch. And it's so rich in filling you.

Hahaha.
03/01/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
With 41gm protein lol. 😜

03/01/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I am going to hack ur mfp so i can copy ur recipes 😂 but i can't have meat so 😭
03/01/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: But taha suggested to weigh it before air frying so now should i enter before weight or after? 👀
03/01/2025, 11:09 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you weighed it before air frying n it was 100g then go with this number for sure
04/01/2025, 12:30 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: I couldnt take a picture today of the dawat food because of awkwardness
04/01/2025, 12:33 am - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
1. One wing and 2 prawns(apetizer)
2. ⁠main courses
3. ⁠a little chowmein
4. ⁠korean chicken came last - was bomb and couldnt resist had 4 of similar sozed bonesless pcs
No judgements plz🙈

How to track?
And i know i went overboard 
But dont think i could hv eaten lesser😰
04/01/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
Would something like this work
04/01/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Nida Umer: Definitely not 50g protein tho
04/01/2025, 12:44 am - Taha Ahmed: First off, no judgments at all! It's totally okay to enjoy a meal out or indulge in your favorite dishes now and then - it’s part of life, and guilt doesn’t belong at the table

1. 150-180 kcal
2. 280-320 kcal
3. 140-160 kcal
4. 120-150 kcal

Overall, this meal might fall between 690-810 kcal and yes, defo not 50g protein. Maybe total 25-30g!

You didn’t really “go overboard”, haha! You enjoyed yourself, and that’s okay. Track it and move on! 😎
04/01/2025, 12:46 am - Taha Ahmed: I’ve earned myself a similar plate for all my hard work now, minus the prawns (can't have it cause of a shellfish allergy)! 😄
04/01/2025, 12:46 am - PF - Nida Umer: Not bad!!!!!
I was thinking shayd 1000 cals
04/01/2025, 12:47 am - PF - Nida Umer: I ate in a lot of moderation as compared to my old self
I used to go mad🫣
04/01/2025, 12:49 am - Taha Ahmed: That's good. The foods not vanishing and Cocochan is still going to be around tomorrow.
04/01/2025, 12:49 am - Taha Ahmed: Mindset shift 💫
04/01/2025, 12:49 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: how can I track puri?
04/01/2025, 12:49 am - PF - Nida Umer: Yesssssss
04/01/2025, 12:49 am - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you Taha ❤️
04/01/2025, 12:50 am - Taha Ahmed: 80g puri will be ~550-600 calories
Alu chana 90g ~250-300 calories depending upon how oily 
Halwa ~150-175 calories

04/01/2025, 12:50 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: hell naw
04/01/2025, 12:51 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: really :o
04/01/2025, 12:51 am - Taha Ahmed: Unfortunately yes 😂
04/01/2025, 12:53 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: kill me
04/01/2025, 12:53 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: ufff
04/01/2025, 12:55 am - PF - Nida Umer: Never again
04/01/2025, 12:56 am - PF - Nida Umer: Baqi din kuch nahi kha sakte😂

04/01/2025, 12:57 am - PF - Nida Umer: Is this puri paratha?
04/01/2025, 12:57 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Puri
04/01/2025, 12:58 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: how much is a mutton rib in grams usually?
04/01/2025, 12:58 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: single one
04/01/2025, 12:58 am - PF - Nida Umer: Ribs have less meat n more bone
04/01/2025, 12:58 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: and more fat
04/01/2025, 1:00 am - Taha Ahmed: I love halwa puri too! It’s one of the tastiest yet quirkiest combinations- so indulgent, but yeah, nutritionally, it doesn’t really offer much. As a foodie, I enjoy having it because it’s a cultural classic and just so satisfying. But as someone who’s mindful about nutrition, I’ve made an informed choice to limit it to once every 3-4 months, sometimes even more. The last time I had it was after my surgeries in July haha! I think I'd like to have it this Sunday with Dad.

Good thing is that I don’t crave it in between, and I’m not dying to have it all the time. It’s more of a treat for me now, something I can enjoy guilt-free when I do have it!
04/01/2025, 1:01 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yea I rarely have halwa puri too
04/01/2025, 1:01 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: maybe having it after 3-4 months
04/01/2025, 1:01 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: but I thought aik puri 250g ke hogi
04/01/2025, 1:01 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 250cals
04/01/2025, 1:02 am - Taha Ahmed: Depends! The size of mutton ribs can vary a lot depending on the cut and the animal itself
04/01/2025, 1:02 am - PF - Nida Umer: Alhamdulilah that i dont crave it too 
Used to have it a lot in my bachpan with dad 
It was almost like a sunday ritual.
Could afford it then😂 

Ab to gunah lagega calories janne k bad
04/01/2025, 1:02 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Jo bahir milti hein <This message was edited>
04/01/2025, 1:03 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: bbq tonigt size I think
04/01/2025, 1:03 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1 puri soaks around 1.5tbsp oil so that alone is ~200cals
04/01/2025, 1:03 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 80g maybe?
04/01/2025, 1:03 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yeah makes sense
04/01/2025, 1:12 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: <Media omitted>

04/01/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Whenever you feel a little panicky, try to remind yourself
04/01/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
04/01/2025, 1:36 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: should I distribute this over the next few days @923343773307 ?
04/01/2025, 1:37 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 1k / in 10 days?
04/01/2025, 1:37 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923002040986 like @923343773307 said, it's a part of life and guilt doesn't belong at the table. Plus you said it yourself, you ate in moderation. Give yourself a pat on the back 🙏🏼you are better informed now and you are striving to make long term good choices so one meal is not going to derail your progress 🤗
04/01/2025, 1:38 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): maybe just eat 200ish less calories for next 5 days n u will be at a balance simple
04/01/2025, 1:38 am - PF - Nida Umer: Kha lia but ghabrae hum bilkul nahi😂
04/01/2025, 1:38 am - PF - Nida Umer: Thankkss
04/01/2025, 1:53 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: I like this track it and move on approach
04/01/2025, 1:54 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Was feeling shit about my calories today, didn't put my dinner in the app cuz I know it'll put me way over
04/01/2025, 1:54 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Now I'm just gonna put it in and move on
04/01/2025, 2:00 am - Taha Ahmed: It’s like failing a test but knowing why you failed. That clarity gives you a chance to grow and improve. Life’s like that, isn’t it? A series of experiments, not a pass/fail game. Each choice teaches you something new, and moving on is how you keep playing the long game -without guilt, just grace... haye! haha
04/01/2025, 2:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Love to see this shift 🤟🏼
04/01/2025, 2:07 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yep that is what I was thinking
04/01/2025, 2:08 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I've been in this exact same situation so I know how you feel.
04/01/2025, 2:13 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Then I did this, noted the portion sizes and the related calories, and made mental notes on how I can adjust and enjoy the same foods next time and not go over my target or maybe stop near maintainence calories
04/01/2025, 2:37 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: _guilt doesn't belong at the table_ 
somebody should pin it or make it fomo's tagline
04/01/2025, 2:38 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yea, this is very helpful
04/01/2025, 2:38 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: now I know how much puri to eat or when to simply avoid it
04/01/2025, 2:38 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: I've been skipping tracking lately too. because i know I'll go overboard and that'll give me anxiety. but ill fix that and follow the same approach ✨
04/01/2025, 2:39 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
now that i gotta track it. 100ml crunch kulfi. the website or the pack didn't mention kcals. estimate pls?
04/01/2025, 2:40 am - Taha Ahmed: I’ll add it to the starter’s guide and make it the slogan for our IG page…

But you all should also take screenshots of the occasional wisdom I share and send it to others- get them to join us so we can help more people, hahah! 😅
04/01/2025, 2:42 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: i do :p 
don't think my people will join but they're benefitting :p
04/01/2025, 2:52 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 180-240

04/01/2025, 10:22 am - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: <Media omitted>
For oil is this correct?
04/01/2025, 10:26 am - PF - Ali Hassan: If u used whole milk then log it as whole milk
04/01/2025, 10:26 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Or tap on 100 ml it might give other options
04/01/2025, 10:27 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>

And then change no of servings to 67
04/01/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Nida Umer: Or enter fraction when selecting qty

Is it a correct entry for 6 inch subway sandwich?
04/01/2025, 2:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but this is without sauces and cheese
04/01/2025, 2:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You need to add those if you are adding those
04/01/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: I chose yellow cheese
And ranch and chipotle
So I will measure them as what?
04/01/2025, 2:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): cheese 1 slice ~70 calories
and for sauces they add around 14-15g of each sauce
04/01/2025, 2:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ranch sauce 14-15g will be 70-75 calories n chipotle 14-15g ~60 calories
04/01/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also if you just search subway and the name of the sauce you get the entry.
04/01/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same for the cheese
04/01/2025, 4:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>

04/01/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Hey! I have to go to a dawat today but i dont know how i will track food there. 

Taking a picture even dont seem a good idea i think. 

What do you suggest? 

I have breakfast of 335 calories and i want to keep the remaining for tonight. 

Is it a good idea? What do you guys suggest?
04/01/2025, 5:27 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This can help you @4917661011096
04/01/2025, 5:28 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Can you copy and send? I cant read it as this message is old ( before me in this group)
04/01/2025, 5:28 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Another quick hack for tracking food at dawats or shaadi dinners: (you don't need to carry your kitchen scales haha 😂)

Measure in tablespoons!
1 tbsp = ~15g (works great for rice, pasta, etc.).
For example, 8 tbsp of rice = ~120g.

It’s not super precise, but it’s a handy way to stay mindful of portions without stressing over exact measurements. 
Guesstimates > no estimates, right?

You can thank me later! 🙏🏽
04/01/2025, 5:29 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Shared by ~. 🙂

Thanks!
04/01/2025, 5:30 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Oh yes that i can don if they will cook desi food. 

Good idea

04/01/2025, 5:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If possible if get a high protein snack in before dinner. Like a late lunch or evening snack. 

The reason I say that is because if you’ve just eaten breakfast then you’ll be starving for dinner and way more likely to overeat compared to if you were somewhat already full and not that hungry.

04/01/2025, 7:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Usually I do 60% kahwa, 40% milk when I make it at home
So if I have a big mug, which is like 350ml, I only track 40% milk added in it, which is around ~140ml 
350ml x 0.4 (40%) = 140ml <This message was edited>

How do I track this? I have tindas and zucchini stuffed with beef mince and some rice, cooked in tomato sauce. How do I track the nutrition for one piece with 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce?

Is this correct?
04/01/2025, 8:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just made one here

04/01/2025, 9:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Looks like 80-90g chicken so you can add it as chicken breast 80-90g 1tsp oil
fish tikka (not so sure about the size from the picture) but if its just 1 piece then 70-80g fish 1tsp oil

04/01/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This calories are for cooked. Raw would 500-550 calories.
04/01/2025, 9:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: yeah i didn’t have much noodles tbf
04/01/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s the shawarma. This is just Arabic chicken boti.
04/01/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Total 150g chicken and 70-80g fish maybe.

04/01/2025, 10:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: One day won’t matter
04/01/2025, 10:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And 35 calories isn’t breakfast.

Made this minced chicken with spaghetti for dinner

Doesn't look good cause I had some issues with canned tomato puree, so had to make it fresh at home, but it tasted so much better 😁
04/01/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Cravings have just started. 😋

1.5-2tsp oil is fine for MFP.

Guide me in potatoes and peas weight please.
05/01/2025, 12:22 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 60-65g potato
20-25g peas
05/01/2025, 12:42 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Allah ka shukar hai 😬
05/01/2025, 12:43 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Done. Thanks!
05/01/2025, 12:49 am - Taha Ahmed: Looks really good! 😋
05/01/2025, 12:51 am - Taha Ahmed: Remove 1/4, then search for its entry and add 0.25 servings instead of 1 serving to account for 1/4th portion of the meal
05/01/2025, 12:51 am - Taha Ahmed: When tracking any food, don’t search for the serving size. Instead, adjust it directly while selecting the serving size and number of servings in MFP
05/01/2025, 1:09 am - PF - Nida Umer: I went to a wedding today 
And saved up cals for it.

I started of pretty well with a well balanced plate.
But i think because i was hungry since so long 
I went for a second serving and there was such a vastttt variety of food - it was almost like a sensory overload.

Now i feel bad for going for seconds😭
What could i have done better?
05/01/2025, 1:16 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Had a protein heavy snack early on to feel full and not as hungry as sameet said earlier.
05/01/2025, 1:17 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: ⬆️
05/01/2025, 1:20 am - PF - Nida Umer: Thanx 
I was so busy today

05/01/2025, 1:24 am - You removed PF - Bismah Nayyer
05/01/2025, 1:30 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I somehow completed my protein intake .

05/01/2025, 1:34 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I couldn't find cooked chicken mince so put chicken breast instead . Does that count ok. ? Also, I want to know . I use scale to measure both veggies and chicken .
05/01/2025, 1:35 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, that's fine if you tracked your grounded/minced chicken as chicken breast. Essentially it's the same thing!
05/01/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: But olive oil I just added a tablespoon in all the mince with masala. So it was very less. I made like 15 kebabs in total
05/01/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Hira Wakil joined from the community
05/01/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Am I underestimating?
05/01/2025, 1:37 am - Taha Ahmed: No, I don't think so. You're good!
1tbsp oil = 15g
15g /15 kebabs = 1g oil in each kebab 
I see you've added 3ml for your portion 

Did you use more oil to cook your food?
05/01/2025, 1:37 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Its made in airfryer
05/01/2025, 1:37 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: No more oil added
05/01/2025, 1:39 am - Taha Ahmed: Then you're good!
05/01/2025, 1:43 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I managed to have 95g in protein altogether in breakfast snack and dinner . So if I take two meals a day on my rest days. Would it help me lose weight or fat faster ?

05/01/2025, 1:51 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No when total calories per day are equated it doesnt matter if u r having 2 meals a day or 6 , fatloss/weightloss will be the same 
we have actual research data on it
05/01/2025, 1:52 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I get what you mean it doesn't matter. But having two meals will be less calories than having 3 meals
05/01/2025, 1:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can consume exactly the same calories in 2 meals jo aap 3 ya 4 meals ma laingi
05/01/2025, 1:55 am - Taha Ahmed: That's a really good time to have an icecream/dessert to bump up your calories, just saying!! 😉
05/01/2025, 1:56 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: To phir patli kese hongi ....
05/01/2025, 1:57 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Fomo join hue 2 month hue but I have been training for 8 months.. my weight neither goes up or go down either. Even if I binge for a week . Or eat low calories for a week.
05/01/2025, 1:59 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Although I'm happy for maintaining. But as sameet suggested to low 100 calories . And see with in 3 weeks for results .
05/01/2025, 2:01 am - Taha Ahmed: Hmm. Okay think of your daily calorie budget like a flexible spending plan. If your baseline is 1500 calories, that’s the total you aim for in a day, and you’ve divided it into three meals (400 calories each) and two snacks (300 calories total). That’s great!

But life doesn’t always go as planned, right? If one day you only eat 2 meals and 2 snacks, that’s 1100 calories  - leaving 400 calories 'unused.' 
Here's where flexibility comes in:

1. *If you're hungry*, you can use those 400 calories for something you enjoy - whether it's a dessert, a bigger portion for dinner, or even a treat you’ve been craving.
2. *If you're not hungry*, it’s okay to let it be. It’s just one day, and those 400 calories won’t make or break your progress.

The important part is understanding that hitting your calorie target is about averages over time, not perfection every single day. Skipping a meal or indulging occasionally won’t derail your journey as long as you stay consistent overall. 

As long as you're hitting your protein targets and staying in a deficit, it's all good! Flexibility keeps it sustainable and guilt-free! <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 2:02 am - Taha Ahmed: Have you checked your inches, how your clothes fit you and how you look in the mirror? Don't just rely on the numbers on the scale - the numbers fluctuate and never give the whole picture.

You could also be getting stronger and building more strength and stamina. 🤷🏽‍♂ <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 2:04 am - Taha Ahmed: If your deficit is 1400 calories, you could be eating icecream worth 1400 calories and still be losing weight.
Pata hona mushkil nahi hai, ussey sustainable tareeqay sa karna aur results ko sustain karna mushkil hai.
Tbhe balanced nutritional intake important hai.
Idk if I'm making sense??!! <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 2:10 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Baseline calories are what we should be consuming everyday according to ur calculator right? So how do I know how much deficit i’m in?
05/01/2025, 2:16 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, the baseline calories we’ve calculated based on your goals is your starting point - it's what you should be consuming to get to your goals (whether it's weight loss or muscle gain). We use this as a foundation!

If you're in a calorie deficit, you should see gradual weight loss over time. However, it’s important to note that this may not always happen immediately. Factors like muscle building, water retention, and body recomposition can cause temporary fluctuations that mask weight loss in the short term. (Probably what Aysha is experiencing atm!)

Typically, you should start seeing noticeable changes in 3-4 weeks, especially if you've been following the plan consistently. If after that time there’s no progress, that’s when we might reassess (what Sameet suggested to Aysha), although this doesn’t always mean something’s wrong. It’s a nuanced process, and we need to consider a variety of factors, such as your activity level, sleep, stress, and more.

Tracking and being consistent is key, but give yourself some time to adjust, as results can vary depending on the situation!
05/01/2025, 2:16 am - Taha Ahmed: What I just shared should be a separate guide now, haha! 😂
05/01/2025, 2:18 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's very helpful
05/01/2025, 2:19 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And at this point people usually lose motivation after being consistent. And I just need that push to keep going
05/01/2025, 2:19 am - Taha Ahmed: That’s why you need to answer this question honestly! <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I also posted taha 
On Facebook post. Sameet personally said to stay on 1500 but if I am impatient. I can reduce to 100
05/01/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes . There is not much difference. My biceps are even gone bigger . But in a good way
05/01/2025, 2:21 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes I'm stronger
05/01/2025, 2:21 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And have more stamina
05/01/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Shoulders are big too . But I want my lower body to go small not my upper body big . I don't know if I'm making any sense
05/01/2025, 2:23 am - Taha Ahmed: I’ve had a very busy weekend- there are a couple of pending posts. I’ll get to them shortly, and then we can discuss this in detail over there. I have a lot of questions to ask you to get to the bottom of this, help you make sense of things, and maybe offer some support and motivation too

I like to sit with it, think it through, and respond thoughtfully. That’s why I haven’t approved or responded to any posts yet. <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 2:24 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sure no rush
05/01/2025, 2:25 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: So i’m stuck at ~1.5 kg loss since i started in Nov. But i’ve lost in inches which is a relief. So I know something is working :)

Morning guys☀️
So this was my calories intake yesterday
Im not so good at macros but I am trying to eat less carbs and more protein
I just started like a day ago so weight is like 2 kgs down but thats water weight I believe, i will also post in detail on fb later.
Currently I am confused with more protein food options. Any suggestions are welcomed
05/01/2025, 10:40 am - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: Also what is this 17 exercise written above?
05/01/2025, 10:43 am - PF - Rehan Shah: It’s adding back the calories that you burned while exercising
05/01/2025, 10:44 am - PF - Rehan Shah: I personally have turned this option off…
05/01/2025, 10:49 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: you can add eggs, some nuggets or sausages or kababs to your breakfast to increase protein. 
and i think we're supposed to have the exercise option turned off since the coaches say those cals aren't very accurate.
05/01/2025, 10:55 am - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: Thanks I wasnt aware of that thing
05/01/2025, 10:55 am - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: Will turn off too looks annoying
05/01/2025, 10:56 am - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: Thanks for the suggestions
Will incorporate them
05/01/2025, 10:59 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
is this true? @coaches
05/01/2025, 11:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I read a research about it as well it does soothe ur throat
05/01/2025, 11:01 am - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: Pls do share how to turn it off too
05/01/2025, 11:03 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: settings > go down to steps > turn the thing off
05/01/2025, 11:03 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>

05/01/2025, 11:46 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this correct for a jawar roti
05/01/2025, 11:59 am - PF - Faraz Nafees: Hey im finding it hard to track hotpot i had for dinner last night. How do i track 1 serving of chinese noodles and the hotpot with the spicy flavour that has so much oil in it. Chicken and beef i can guestimate.
05/01/2025, 12:00 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: On macrosfirst
05/01/2025, 12:51 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: You popped them in the air fryer directly without any external oil application? 🤔 Asking because I'd like to try it too @60193244266
05/01/2025, 12:53 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Even though I'm not a big Chai fan, I'd definitely try your version over the mainstream ones 👍🏼
05/01/2025, 12:56 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: This includes deep frying?
05/01/2025, 1:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, that's probably water weight!

And if you're confused about more protein food options, check out this protein guide of ours:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/projectfomo/permalink/520218567386426/ <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 1:06 pm - PF - Aisha Manzoor Ahmad: Whey protein can also be taken if my stomach can tolerate?
I mean if I find hard to eat chicken all time and need quick source so?
05/01/2025, 1:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s mostly anecdotal, I believe.  
Some people experience more positive effects than negative, while others don’t.  
So, it’s unfair to make a blanket statement like, “This is how it is!”  
And no, sugar doesn’t work that way.  
If your immunity is already weak, you could get a sore throat even without sugar and anything that's cold.

Where is it from? I mean the source!
05/01/2025, 1:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's good. Love the small changes!
05/01/2025, 1:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Depends.  
I’d say weigh yours and then track it!  
For all we know, these macros and calories might be for a 20g jawar roti. 🤷🏽‍♂️
05/01/2025, 1:10 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: Gemini :p
05/01/2025, 1:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Well, Gemini picks stuff off websites and articles on Google -and we know most of those are opinions and random nonsense, not actual evidence-based information

So don’t listen to Gemini or even ChatGPT- they cherry-pick things, and if you ask for evidence, they provide incorrect citations 😂
05/01/2025, 1:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not sure how big was 1 serving of Chinese noodles, so you'll have to guesstimate that as well. I'd say add 200g-300g cooked noodles and track that
05/01/2025, 1:15 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: just a random question. researches can be biased too right? like i rmr watching a documentary which said a research was funded by cocacola to promote their agenda or sales. 
I'm not sure if im phrasing it right. and i dont mean all of them. but there is a chance tho right?
05/01/2025, 1:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Absolutely, research can be biased, esp when funded by organizations with a vested interest in the results. For example, Coca Cola has funded studies emphasizing exercise over diet in addressing obesity, subtly aligning with their sales goals. Now not all research is biased, ofcourse. It's why it's important to check for conflicts of interest, funding sources, and the broader body of evidence to get a more balanced perspective (that means, you don't look at one study, rather look at meta-analyses or systematic reviews, that are based on tens of those individual studies)
05/01/2025, 1:43 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: makes sense.
05/01/2025, 1:49 pm - PF - Nida Umer: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEblYyiuO6u/?igsh=MWxlamVkMXd3ZDFmMA==

05/01/2025, 4:38 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if it was oily then 2tsp probably
05/01/2025, 4:38 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks around 60-70g

05/01/2025, 4:43 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I need feedback on my workout

05/01/2025, 4:47 pm - PF - Nida Umer: If we eat chicken gravy
We record chicken n oil only?

I am a person who adds a lot of gravy
So isnt that quite a few cals too?
How to record that
05/01/2025, 4:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You can add tomatoes if  you want too
05/01/2025, 4:54 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
Hey coaches! Its kiri‘s label, i understand 18grams of it has 55 calories but there is no direct protein mention on it but its label says it has egg white 1,6 grams, should i consider that as protein or not?
05/01/2025, 5:04 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes 1.6g protein
05/01/2025, 5:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Elweiss is protein
05/01/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Do we need to count johar joshanda calories? 👀
05/01/2025, 5:36 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @60193244266 icymi
05/01/2025, 5:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Don't know about the one in the video but I can show you estimate of the one I get near my office - got a reality check after I counted the calories 😂 @923002040986

05/01/2025, 5:56 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yeh kum oil mai hai
05/01/2025, 5:56 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ?
05/01/2025, 5:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: No control over oil as it's bought from a shop

05/01/2025, 5:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I was having two sometimes before counting calories 😬
05/01/2025, 5:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: So imagine being left over with just roughly 400 calories for dinner and I had no idea
05/01/2025, 6:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depends kitna desi ghee use kia hai for cookinh if paratha is weighing e.g 100g after cooking then ~265 to just roti ki calories then proper parathy ma dough ma 1-1.5tbsp desi ghee dala hota n then cooking ma again 4-5tbsp so thats ~5-6tbsp which is like ~650ish calories <This message was edited>

05/01/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Farah Salman: She also makes calorie tracked meals if we want ready made food
05/01/2025, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You can spray some oil if you want.
05/01/2025, 7:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just search cooked ground beef
05/01/2025, 7:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just the oil

05/01/2025, 8:38 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: How can we track chicken boneless in myfitness pal as chicken boneless or chicken breast raw?
05/01/2025, 8:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): simply chicken breast 
if you weighed raw then chicken breast raw & if u weighed cooked then chicken breast cooked
05/01/2025, 8:39 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Got it
05/01/2025, 8:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Agr bonless chicken ho(not breast) to uske liye Bhi breast log kre?
05/01/2025, 8:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no if you know k kis part ka hai then usky accordingly log n track krna hai
05/01/2025, 8:44 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And if I don’t know then breast.correct
05/01/2025, 8:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): mostly boneless breast ka e hota hai
05/01/2025, 8:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Boneless is almost always breast.
05/01/2025, 8:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same for keema.
05/01/2025, 8:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But if you’re not sure then better to log chicken thigh
05/01/2025, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And even then the difference in calories is non existent so don’t really need to worry about these things
05/01/2025, 8:53 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: 🆗

90g seekh kabab
35+35+35+35 ~ 140g tikka boti

2tsp oil

Am I right?
05/01/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
50g rice
35g chicken 
1tsp gravy 

Am I right?
05/01/2025, 11:12 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Mutton weight estimation pls

50g and 3-4 tsp oil?

I had half of it. Guide?
05/01/2025, 11:13 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Estimation for this quantity of garage ka halwa? 

4tsp.
05/01/2025, 11:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey dear coaches,
Pls let me know about these.

P.s. Shaddi's and Dawat season  😂 and luckily I had fast today. 😎 <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 11:24 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I’d like this dawat season to be over. 😀
05/01/2025, 11:24 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Garage ka halwa?😂
05/01/2025, 11:25 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: But still I am doing so well.. Compared to estimate 5-6k cals in a day. I am still in control.
05/01/2025, 11:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Rice is  near a 100 gm i think 
Oil?
Gravy would hv oil
05/01/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I swear
05/01/2025, 11:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Boti looks good. I think kebab is probably more
05/01/2025, 11:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rest looks decent. 

1tsp gravy will also just be 1tsp oil. Rice is like 75g maybe. 

Half of that mutton is go with 50g cooked. 3tsp oil.
05/01/2025, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also another hack for you guys, the more dishes you try when eating out the higher the chance of you going over your calories. 

It’s a concept known as taste fatigue. 

If you eat the same thing, you get bored and full. But if each bite is a different taste then mouthgasms continue and you tend to eat more. 

Buffets use the same concept and also why people over eat. 

Also the same logic behind, I always have room for dessert or dessert ki jagah alag hai lol
05/01/2025, 11:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Is for kabab 120g fine? 

And pls tell me, for boti and kabab, I should add chicken breast cooked??

Gjar k Halwa ki direct entry keron? Ya sirf sugar, khoya and ghee entry?
~ Let me know the estimated calories for this dessert pls.

For 2tbsp cream salad, I should add 2tbsp sweet cream. Right?
05/01/2025, 11:54 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I avoided paratha today because of the caloric discission about it today @60193244266
05/01/2025, 11:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: oh i think it was @923441183411
05/01/2025, 11:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: it seems not worth it
05/01/2025, 11:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 900 cals for a paratha
05/01/2025, 11:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yesterday I had boiled veg peas carrot sweet corn with my meal. I felt really bloated and gassy and my stomach was hurting too.
05/01/2025, 11:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm ok today
05/01/2025, 11:57 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: wondering what are some other common foods in our desi diet that are super high in cals like puri and paratha to keep in mind to only consume every few months
05/01/2025, 11:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I also had protein shake later at night pre made one
05/01/2025, 11:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): control the amount of ghee used & you will save alot of calories 
u can easily keep it within 400-500 calories
06/01/2025, 12:00 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yep but outside or the usual paratha is something for once in a while
06/01/2025, 12:00 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: or a few bites
06/01/2025, 12:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Even a dawn ka paratha is like 300
06/01/2025, 12:01 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: that is not bad <This message was edited>
06/01/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d say use chicken thigh. 

Gajar ka halwa, just add an entry around 150 calories.
06/01/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is that combination a problem
06/01/2025, 12:04 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I use chicken breast entry for everything is it not okay? Because usuallay its like that one piece leg piece few boneless or different types so i excluding bones weight use chicken breast entry
06/01/2025, 12:06 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Sabroso chicken cheese paratha is under or 500 cal.
06/01/2025, 12:06 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it must have a nutrition label on it with calories & macros info
06/01/2025, 12:11 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes,
I bought the pack after reviewing it. I don't remember the exact calories but it's still 500 max.
06/01/2025, 12:15 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: these packaged ones are not a bad idea
06/01/2025, 12:18 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 100g dawn paratha has 450 cals
06/01/2025, 12:19 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 400g = 5 parathas
06/01/2025, 12:19 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yea 360 per
06/01/2025, 12:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope.
06/01/2025, 12:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. It’s fine.
06/01/2025, 12:25 am - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: <Media omitted>
06/01/2025, 12:29 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you sure about these? That’s low but possible hai. 

Just check the packaging to be sure.
06/01/2025, 12:29 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: this is 1 tsp oil paratha?
06/01/2025, 12:29 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 6g fat <This message was edited>
06/01/2025, 12:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Checked online. It’s accurate. 

The paratha is more than 100g so 300ish calories in a paratha with 12g of protein
06/01/2025, 12:30 am - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: Packaging se he bnaya hai. But one paratha weighs 130g not 100g.
06/01/2025, 12:30 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Wow
06/01/2025, 12:30 am - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: Still incorrect?? Pls guide
06/01/2025, 12:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 of these and 24g protein and 600ish calories. Not bad. Add some Greek yoghurt.
06/01/2025, 12:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why was I not aware of this when in Pakistan
06/01/2025, 12:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. It’s perfect
06/01/2025, 12:31 am - PF - Nida Umer: What are the chances package calories are wrong🙈
06/01/2025, 12:31 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Fats low nahi hein for a paratha?
06/01/2025, 12:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sabroso is pretty accurate. Used loads of their products daily for years.
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: Thank god. I consumed it yesterday.
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - PF - Nida Umer: And generally
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. It’s a frozen paratha so it doesn’t have much oil. 

Oil usually is added when people cook it.
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Oh ok!
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: But you don’t need to add oil. It cooks fine without it
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yep same for Dawn
06/01/2025, 12:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: no need of oil in pan
06/01/2025, 12:33 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m also a big fan of their shami and chapli kebabs for quick protein options at home.
06/01/2025, 12:33 am - PF - Nida Umer: Is shami kabab a good option for protein
06/01/2025, 12:33 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: now i am going to get these and have with egg whites omelette 😂
06/01/2025, 12:33 am - PF - Nida Umer: Provided it has lentils in it
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Nida Umer: Does it bend more towards carbs
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s usually a good mix. Honestly just get the sabroso shami
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pretty good and no hassle hahaha
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: Majority of frozen foods can be cooked without oil. Even tender pops can be cooked in pan on steam if not airfried.  They taste good without oil.
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Nida Umer: Sabroso ki sale barhne wali he😂
06/01/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>

06/01/2025, 12:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I wish.
06/01/2025, 12:35 am - PF - Nida Umer: Not bad
06/01/2025, 12:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Comes handy when you’re lazy.
06/01/2025, 12:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Used to makes sandwiches or have them with roti.
06/01/2025, 12:36 am - PF - Nida Umer: Yea i need such options for work snack
06/01/2025, 12:36 am - PF - Nida Umer: Do share more such quick fixes

Per 100 grams! <This message was edited>
06/01/2025, 12:38 am - PF - Asma Tariq: One kbab is for 38-40 gm.
I'm using and weighing it in my meals.
06/01/2025, 12:40 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Tried their patties. More calories than sabroso patties.
06/01/2025, 12:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. I remember it being 40g I think.
06/01/2025, 12:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sabroso is generally the lowest.
06/01/2025, 12:43 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: But KnNs haray bharay nuggets are pretty good for nuggets when it comes to calories.
06/01/2025, 12:47 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Will try it.
06/01/2025, 1:23 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>

I couldn't find the mutton cooked with a green tick.
06/01/2025, 1:28 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search for ground lamb
06/01/2025, 1:28 am - PF - Asma Tariq: O yeah. You told once. Thanks.
06/01/2025, 1:50 am - PF - Asma Tariq: This total Dawat dinner was 1599 calories with 100g 😂

06/01/2025, 9:44 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
It says oven baked next to the 100 grams so should I weigh them oven baked or frozen?
06/01/2025, 9:44 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Skin on french fries
06/01/2025, 9:46 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if they are frozen them weigh frozen

Am I underestimating this or is it fine?
06/01/2025, 1:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's got the same calories in it per serving as Nescafe 3-in-1 unless you add something extra (milk, sugar, creamer, etc.)! The cup is usually small as a well, around ~160-170 ml!
06/01/2025, 1:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on quantity of milk (creamer) and sugar.
06/01/2025, 1:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks fine

Calories for raw lamb brain
06/01/2025, 2:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: If there’s a raw entry available for lamb brain, select that and separately add the amount of oil used during cooking
06/01/2025, 2:47 pm - PF - Amna Awais: <Media omitted>
For raw it will be okay?
06/01/2025, 2:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Calories are a lil less but close! I'd add 10-15 extra grams for safety
06/01/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Okay

06/01/2025, 4:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s good fat, and there’s no harm in consuming fats -as long as they’re not predominantly saturated fats. We all need fats!
06/01/2025, 4:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: As long as you're under your calorie limit, you're good!
06/01/2025, 4:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So it's ok. I'm fasting today and have suhoor and I'm more than half of my fat budget has gone up . And I'm thinking I had whole foods.

06/01/2025, 9:59 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Appreciate the guide.
06/01/2025, 9:59 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
U can try this also comes in vanilla
06/01/2025, 10:00 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: Doesnt Tofu increase estrogen levels?
06/01/2025, 10:00 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Not sure sameet or taha can answer this 🤡
06/01/2025, 10:02 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: parmigiano reggiano (parmesan) is the 👑 here approx 36g protein per 100g 👀
06/01/2025, 10:03 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: Woah really?
06/01/2025, 10:04 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah 😂 i love cheddar cheese and its so high in calories decided to go on a cheese adventure of my own a while ago 🤣
06/01/2025, 10:05 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Parmesan was even higher in calories 😂
06/01/2025, 10:05 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Lol i was abt to ask this
06/01/2025, 10:06 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Hahaha i even tried 50% fat options 30% personally didn't like the taste so abhi bhi normal cheddar cheese he kha ra hn in moderation
06/01/2025, 10:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. That’s a myth too.
06/01/2025, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And all cheese has protein.
06/01/2025, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the brand. When I make Pizza, I add 50% low fat and 50% regular cheddar
06/01/2025, 10:30 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I tried Morrisons 30% tesco 50% and eatlean 🤡
06/01/2025, 10:30 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Eatlean was the worst one it  tasted like soap
06/01/2025, 10:31 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: what would be the best way to utilize my remaining 200 cals to have a fulfilling snack that also has good amount of protein which is not actually a protein shake?
06/01/2025, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Eggs maybe.
06/01/2025, 11:02 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: Really? See this is the reason I joined fomo, you get all your questions answered 👍 thank you. But why do people say that Tofu increases estrogen? I actually love Tofu... Much more than cheese... Sawwie 😬
06/01/2025, 11:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): because people dont know n pretend that they do😄
06/01/2025, 11:04 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: I have always loved the real cheddar, I like the strong one with red grapes as a snack. Have you tried Aldi strong cheddar cheese. Last time we bought it was 2.69 for the block. Try it. Better quality and cheaper too, cheaper than tesco and others in my opinion
06/01/2025, 11:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I use sharp cheddar
06/01/2025, 11:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Usually i buy from lidl I will definitely try Aldi now
06/01/2025, 11:16 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: I still have around 600 calories left my protein for today is only 46 and my carbs are also less than 50 


But due to fever i dont feel like eating anything more or any protein as well 


What should i do?
06/01/2025, 11:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,
Help me track soup. Do we have soup info msg's here in chat. If anyone can help. <This message was edited>

07/01/2025, 12:46 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: same question. i made vege and chicken soup. i tracked all the ingredients i put in but i ate like 20% of it. should i just add the sauces and chicken guesstimates?
07/01/2025, 12:54 am - PF - Asma Tariq: ESPECIALLY clear soups can be super low in calories and great for filling you up.

Hot n Sour is higher than clear soups like Thai soup or other similar ones. 

But not too high either. Has some protein too.

07/01/2025, 12:54 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I found these responses in chat. Might help you or coaches will guide. <This message was edited>
07/01/2025, 1:41 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: @60193244266 highlights looking good!! 😀
07/01/2025, 1:41 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Baalon ki, insta ki nahi 😬
07/01/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hhaahahahahaha yeh that nahin. 3 months ago I dyed my hair blue
07/01/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Woh fade hogaya. Mujhay bura nahin laga blonde effect so chala raha hoon 🤣
07/01/2025, 1:50 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Looks silver in vdos. But looks good!
07/01/2025, 1:51 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yaaa silver type hi hai.
07/01/2025, 1:51 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m thinking I’ll go and get it platinum hahahaha because I’m liking that color
07/01/2025, 1:52 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. It one day so just have what you feel like it. If not hungry, then that’s not an issue either
07/01/2025, 1:52 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I think us ki upkeep is high maintenance.
07/01/2025, 1:52 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. 20% of the ingredients
07/01/2025, 1:52 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Wapis fade ho kay aisa hi hojayega hahahaha
07/01/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
New obsession. Lol but in Calories count.
07/01/2025, 2:47 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Calories?
07/01/2025, 3:11 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
07/01/2025, 3:18 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 🤡
07/01/2025, 4:09 am - Taha Ahmed: Vegan sources? Yes!
Tofu, tempeh, seitan, etc
07/01/2025, 4:15 am - Taha Ahmed: It's not tofu specifically; the myth comes from "*soy*" products in general being linked to increased estrogen levels

This misunderstanding stems from the fact that soy contains *isoflavones*, a type of phytoestrogen, which are plant-based compounds that mimic estrogen but have much weaker effects (you would need to eat tons of soy beans to have any effect on you)

There actually have been multiple studies now, that show that moderate consumption of soy (like tofu) does not significantly impact estrogen levels in men or women and can actually be part of a healthy diet

So, if you like having tofu, then enjoy it!
07/01/2025, 4:20 am - Taha Ahmed: If you’re not feeling well and can’t eat, it’s okay - just let it be!
Focus on having nutritious foods that help you feel better, like soups, teas, and similar options
 You can worry about calories and macros once you’re feeling better
For now, just rest and take care of yourself
Health should be the first priority rn!
07/01/2025, 4:21 am - PF - Syra Hussain: Thanks
07/01/2025, 4:23 am - Taha Ahmed: Calories aren't bad for a 100g serving, I think! 😋
07/01/2025, 5:21 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
This would be cooked?
07/01/2025, 6:34 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes & you will add the oil used in cooking
07/01/2025, 8:14 am - PF - Shireen Yasir: Yayyy thats a relief, all things in moderation are good 👍
07/01/2025, 8:18 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hehehe 💯
07/01/2025, 11:18 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Does it have a rich & satisfying taste? 🤔 I haven't had this particular one but I just calculated the calories for 15g (2 tabs) and it comes out to 81 calories <This message was edited>
07/01/2025, 12:26 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is jowar roti of 100g has this much calories 😲?
07/01/2025, 12:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
yup, maybe more (depending on how it's made)
07/01/2025, 12:39 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I do not add any oil
07/01/2025, 12:41 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: But I thing the serving size is big(100g) after weight it i took half of it (50g)
07/01/2025, 12:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is pure flour's calories
07/01/2025, 12:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: When you knead to make a roti, you add water so there's water + flour, hence fewer calories
07/01/2025, 12:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: So this makes sense
07/01/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
07/01/2025, 12:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you had half of it, then add 170 kcal and move on
07/01/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
07/01/2025, 1:02 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: <Media omitted>
Okay so I made something really delicious today. I have no idea how to track this🤔its made with 3 small eggs, whole milk 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup of oats, 2 heaped tablespoons of cottage cheese, 1 tablespoon of jaggery, 2 Tbsp of flour, blended it, and topped it with blueberries and baked it for about 15 minutes.
I dont think i will eat the whole thing but I might eat half of it.
The problem is, how do I track it? Its not oatmeal or a pancake.
07/01/2025, 1:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Just enter the individual ingredients into the app for the respective quantities & hogya track
07/01/2025, 1:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): quantities apko already pta hai hr ingredient ki
07/01/2025, 1:36 pm - PF - Raheel Tabani: I have been advised by coaches to take 120 gm to 130 gm protein per day..  

I wanted to know this weight is cooked or raw. And any source of protein is good to go or it should be just chicken. I'm more fan of beef and mutton then chicken.
07/01/2025, 1:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this is your total daily protein intake 

Now your protein sources can be any as per your preference & you can track these foods raw or cooked jesy apko measure krna easy lagy
07/01/2025, 1:42 pm - PF - Raheel Tabani: Thanks
07/01/2025, 1:54 pm - PF - Syed Iftikhar Ali joined from the community
07/01/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: Thank you 👍
07/01/2025, 2:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. This is total protein. Not total chicken or meat. 

100g of chicken has about 20g of protein.
07/01/2025, 4:24 pm - PF - Raheel Tabani: How much chicken I have to consume for 120gm of protien
07/01/2025, 4:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you just want to hit your protein goals through chicken, you'll need around 500ish grams of chicken/per day
07/01/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: <Media omitted>
I am taking this entry daily... Is this protein .. right? 62 gm in 200 gm of chicken?
07/01/2025, 4:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Even cooked/dried up chicken breast won't have this much protein
07/01/2025, 4:40 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: 🥹🥹.. so this was worng the whole time💔💔
07/01/2025, 4:40 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: damn, why is tagged as a verified entry.
07/01/2025, 4:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: I mean it has a green tick, so looks like its verified but idk how!
07/01/2025, 4:41 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Yeah😔
07/01/2025, 4:42 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I like dark chocolates. Lol I love all chocolates btw 😂

For me, yes it tastes well and is satisfying. <This message was edited>
07/01/2025, 4:43 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: <Media omitted>
Is this closest?.. should I use this now?
07/01/2025, 4:47 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
@923343773307 I've used this previously for grilled Tikka. Is it wrong? 🤔
07/01/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is fine.
07/01/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g of chicken raw is around 21-24g protein. So 200 is going to be around 45g
07/01/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
07/01/2025, 4:50 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok great
07/01/2025, 4:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
@60193244266 what entry should I use for this?
07/01/2025, 4:51 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
07/01/2025, 4:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Means there is a chance to be wrong of green tick one?
07/01/2025, 4:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Myfitnesspal can be weird at times but usually green tick is fine.
07/01/2025, 4:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is grilled so this should be okay.
07/01/2025, 4:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 220g grilled is almost 300g raw.
07/01/2025, 5:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
For rotisserie chicken (skin-on) what entry do you recommend?
07/01/2025, 5:06 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
I've used this one previously
07/01/2025, 5:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This can work
07/01/2025, 5:09 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thank you
07/01/2025, 5:10 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Does this require oil to be accounted for separately?
07/01/2025, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I don’t think so but you could add some just to be safe.
07/01/2025, 5:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yum
07/01/2025, 8:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: How do I calculate calories in biryani?
07/01/2025, 8:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Lets say I take 150g rice and 150g chicken (from biryani)
07/01/2025, 8:57 pm - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: <Media omitted>
Suggest mfp entry for this. 

These are bakery-bought butter croissants, but they're not the crispy, flaky type they're more like a bread-type croissant.
07/01/2025, 8:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Boiled rice 140g
175g chicken raw
2-3tsp oil (or more depending on how much was added, but usually biryani has loads)
07/01/2025, 9:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Track them as croissants only
You can choose the ones I've highlighted
07/01/2025, 9:08 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Homemade hai. I can ask estimates but estimates only 😀
07/01/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you weigh it on a scale then estimates ki zaroorat nahin hogi.
07/01/2025, 9:18 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Nahi, I did weigh the rice and chicken but woh oil ki quantity ghar se pochnay ka keh raha hoon. Recipe.
07/01/2025, 9:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can estimate it based on how oily it seemed.
07/01/2025, 9:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe use 4tsp
07/01/2025, 9:25 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Just a general question: why did you vary the quantities? If for example i take out 150 grams rice why do i login as 140 grams? 👀
07/01/2025, 9:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: There was no oil accounted for, so I needed to make room for it- that's why! 
By clearing up 20g, I made space for 3-4 tsp of oil. :)
If that makes sense!
07/01/2025, 9:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can do it too when you know what all goes into making a certain recipe/food
07/01/2025, 9:29 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Oh! Got it 
Thanks
07/01/2025, 9:37 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: <Media omitted>
07/01/2025, 9:37 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ate 160g rice and 170g chicken
07/01/2025, 9:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: @923343773307
07/01/2025, 9:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: i am going to build a recipe out of it in mfp
07/01/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also not do that. I used to too but now that I don’t bother. So I’d just track that as 150g of rice, 150g cooked chicken or 200g raw chicken and then 3-4tsp oil
07/01/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: So if i know the oil in whole? I can add cooked quantities 150 150 and then separate entry for oil? 
Right?
07/01/2025, 9:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
07/01/2025, 9:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Based on how much you put in the entire thing you can estimate for one portion.
07/01/2025, 10:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 1. 1.5 kg chicken
2. 1kg rice
3. ⁠250g oil
07/01/2025, 10:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: @923343773307
07/01/2025, 10:02 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: for full biryani
07/01/2025, 10:38 pm - PF - Raheel Tabani: What's the difference between calories of normal oil and olive oil?
07/01/2025, 10:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: No difference
07/01/2025, 10:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for the similar quantity both have similar amount of calories
07/01/2025, 10:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: According to my tracking
07/01/2025, 10:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hmm tricky
07/01/2025, 10:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s almost 4-5tsp per your quantities.
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: maybe chatgpt can help
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. I’ve done the math lol
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ohh ok
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 17g of oil in your serving.
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: so its fine
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: this
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just to be safe use 5tsp then
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes
07/01/2025, 10:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ohh wrong rice
07/01/2025, 10:51 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: So that means desi ghee and olive oil have same calories?
07/01/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pretty much.
07/01/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey coaches,
I had mattar palao today, weighed 230g (cooked by mother so I have not accurate weights for whole)

200 cooked white rice
30g cooked peas
1.5 tsp oil

It was not oily. Is it tracked well? <This message was edited>
07/01/2025, 11:53 pm - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Salam home made kheer 100 gm

08/01/2025, 12:52 am - PF - Ali Hassan: My fitness pal
08/01/2025, 12:52 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah looks good!!
08/01/2025, 12:53 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Main to individual entry dalta ager bnata more accurate this way maybe 🤔
08/01/2025, 12:54 am - Taha Ahmed: If you make a recipe out of it using individual foods, you'll be able to track better. It'd be more accurate too! <This message was edited>
08/01/2025, 1:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe do 5% of all these ingredients. 

So: 150ml milk 
5ml cream
12g sugar
15g dry fruits
08/01/2025, 1:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Looks good. I’d still keep 2tsp oil just for safety.
08/01/2025, 1:15 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Done!
08/01/2025, 12:23 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this multi grain flour has 348cal per 100g?🤔
08/01/2025, 12:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes
08/01/2025, 12:24 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Oky so should i weight the cooked roti or flour?
08/01/2025, 12:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can do both. For cooked roti, about 50g is 120-140 calories
08/01/2025, 12:32 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
08/01/2025, 12:32 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this fine sir?
08/01/2025, 12:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is for the flour. Not the roti.
08/01/2025, 12:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For roti, search roti.
08/01/2025, 12:34 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
08/01/2025, 12:35 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>

08/01/2025, 3:34 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: How to track fruit chaat? 
I mean idk what all fruits (can guess obv) are there but it has no sugar/ tang.
08/01/2025, 3:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: MFP has a mixed fruit entry, just select that and track it <This message was edited>
08/01/2025, 3:39 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: <Media omitted>
I usually used the fruit chaat bowl ones entries. Now using this mixed fruit entry. Hope its finee 🫡
08/01/2025, 3:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Mixed fruit is a verified entry!
The other is made by some human - more room for error in it (pata nahi kya kya add kiya chaat mai 🤷🏽‍♂)
08/01/2025, 3:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Another alternative is to just pick the highest calorie fruit in it and log that as 150g

Or divide it into all the fruits you’ve used.

@60193244266 phir mai pizza order karlu ? They claim the calories mentioned are for 1 whole pizza

08/01/2025, 6:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But it’s thin crust and very less cheese
08/01/2025, 6:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Evergreen ka pizza is definitely much higher

08/01/2025, 6:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: I asked for the ingredients once because I wanted to make a less caloric version of it; it's got around ~1100-1300 calories /per serving 

It has 150g cooked spaghetti, fried turkey bacon, fried chicken in chilli oil, loads of butter, cream and cheese (they call it cream sauce)
08/01/2025, 6:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Literally. Ditto.

Like what do you used to eat in ramadan any example?

& if its malai boti then 1tbsp cream add krlena
08/01/2025, 8:40 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok thanks
08/01/2025, 8:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): lets say normal naan has 250 calories then roghni for the same quantity will have 300ish because either us k uper ya andr thora sa oil added hota hai

08/01/2025, 8:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Also when I asked about roghni naan (per 100g) he suggested to add 50-60 cals because of oil and sesame seeds
08/01/2025, 8:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): exactly
08/01/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I was thinking same
08/01/2025, 9:14 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Butter bhi uper
08/01/2025, 9:51 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: The tandoor I go to lets you slather the oil on by yourself. I should put 100 on top considering how generously I apply 😂
08/01/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I made chicken hot and sour soup. It has lots of soy sauce
08/01/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And 3 tablespoon of cornflour
08/01/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's about 8 servings
08/01/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: How do I track it
08/01/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
08/01/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I had one bowl full
08/01/2025, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. If you know quantities of the full dish and you had 1 out of 8 servings then just divided all ingredients by 8 and add 1 serving ki quantity
09/01/2025, 1:44 am - PF - Asma Tariq: For tracking home Gajrela/carrot pudding, should I only add milk and sugar? 

Milk, carrots and sugar were used. Cooked like kheer but without khoya or powdered milk. 

I just need a guess estimate for a 1 cup/serving.
09/01/2025, 1:51 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
One small bowl. Like this.
09/01/2025, 1:53 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
1 tsp oil for 2 kebabs enough hai ?
09/01/2025, 2:14 am - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
For the chicken palao, only for the chicken should i use this entry? Or anyother? Its mixed chicken
09/01/2025, 5:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I use 1tsp per kebab
09/01/2025, 5:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I would use chicken thigh
09/01/2025, 5:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ummm yeah. You could also add some carrots but most calories will be milk and sugar
09/01/2025, 8:43 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Guess estimation for quantities or total calories for this?
09/01/2025, 8:45 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if this bowl weighs lets say 150g then depending upon how sweet it is i would log it as 
25g carrots
2-3tsp sugar 
110g milk
09/01/2025, 8:49 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I couldn't weigh it unfortunately, 
I added 
4tsp sugar
250ml fresh whole milk 

Didn't add carrots, let me add these.

Rest is fine na or what you say?
09/01/2025, 8:51 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this bowl is small i have a similar kinda bowl at home n ye 250g weigh nhi hota fully filled 
so 250ml milk ki zarurat nhi krna e hai to 175ml krlena n if it was too sweet then 4tsp is fine else 2-2.5tsp would work
09/01/2025, 8:53 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Done! 👍
09/01/2025, 12:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Keep in mind that if it’s made like kheer then a lot of the water in milk must have evaporated. 

So even though it’s like 150g. It could have calories of 250-300ml milk
09/01/2025, 12:23 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Carrot pudding main rice b add hote hain

Wat will be the raw weight
09/01/2025, 4:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: 50 x 1.25 = 62.5g
09/01/2025, 4:06 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Thxx
09/01/2025, 4:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’ll have similar calories to a sugary truffle cake made with sugar and flour, if not more- thanks to the almond flour.
09/01/2025, 4:08 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Also, according to my estimation, 30g Raw rice is almost 100gm boiled rice
Is this  fine?
09/01/2025, 4:08 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: yep
09/01/2025, 4:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it's more or less the same

But usually it's 50/50 I think! <This message was edited>
09/01/2025, 4:10 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: gluten free and keto items have more calories usually because it is fat focused and fat is 9 cals while carbs are 4

09/01/2025, 4:14 pm - PF - Farah Salman: What do u mean by 50/50?
09/01/2025, 4:17 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok.. seekh kebab ki entry main.. oil alag sy add krun phirM

09/01/2025, 4:28 pm - PF - Farah Salman: U mean 30 raw shud be 60gm cooked
09/01/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: My daughter had a surgery today

Still at the hosp and she doesnt want me to leave her side
09/01/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Guess who is gonna eat a whole bakra tonight😂
09/01/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: #soooo hungryyyy
09/01/2025, 4:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: On average, 30 grams of raw rice weighs around 80–90 grams when cooked, depending on the type of rice and cooking method. For example, white rice usually absorbs about 2–2.5 times its weight in water, which is why raw-to-cooked conversions can vary slightly, but because we all cook our rice differently, the water in it can vary too - why I take the 50/50 approach when guesstimating (a way to overestimate calories to be safe).

So your estimate of 30 grams raw being about 100 grams cooked is pretty close to being accurate! However, it's best to measure your rice raw for precise tracking since cooked weights can fluctuate based on how much water it absorbs.

I hope this clarifies any confusion!
09/01/2025, 4:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oh I hope everything's alright?
09/01/2025, 4:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you can, get a snack or some fruits to have while you're there - won't feel as hungry later!
09/01/2025, 4:37 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Let me chk

Can i get some help with calculating the calories of my lunch please?
2 pieces of chicken
3 tsp of gobhi ka salan
2 tsp greek yogurt
Mixed Salad
70 gram whole wheat roti
09/01/2025, 5:00 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: does whey shake help with appetite or is it the fact that chicken has more volume that makes protein leaving us fuller for a longer time?
09/01/2025, 5:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken thigh raw 80g
Oil 3tsp
30g Greek yogurt 
70g roti
09/01/2025, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Protein generally has a satiating effect but volume also has an impact on hunger. 

And so does chewing. You chew chicken whereas you drink a shake so chicken takes more time and effort to eat and that’s why can be more satiating too.
09/01/2025, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Let me summarize how I do raw to cooked transformations. 


Meats: Cooked weight x 1.35 = Raw weight 

So 100g cooked chicken is about 135g raw chicken. 

If you select both these entries, you’ll see they are almost identical. 

For rice and pasta: Raw weight X 3 

is cooked weight. 

Again, you’ll see 100g rice and 300g cooked rice are almost identical entries. 

There’s also some over estimation built in here just to be safe.
09/01/2025, 5:25 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Are these entries fine?
09/01/2025, 5:25 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Not much big difference  in thigh n breast
I always thot thigh is v much high in cals

09/01/2025, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The difference is in macros (protein). Not calories.
09/01/2025, 5:48 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Do we need to measure yeast in the pizza dough as well?
09/01/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re making it, yes.
09/01/2025, 5:50 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Yes.

I want to make popcorn out of these corns, how would i track it as popcorn or as corn or what ?
09/01/2025, 6:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can do both, but if you’re making it yourself, weigh the raw corn kernels and butter separately. It’s better to log them individually for more accurate tracking! <This message was edited>
09/01/2025, 6:23 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: No butter
09/01/2025, 6:24 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Only corn
09/01/2025, 6:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then, just track the corn kernels!
09/01/2025, 6:25 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>

all these variables can increase or decrease the number of calories

10/01/2025, 5:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely. Just weigh it in grams. Easier to calculate then too.

10/01/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is it a good idea to leave some calories at the end of the day ..just to compensate the calories for this
10/01/2025, 11:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Like 2 bites of the cake? That’ll be like 40ish calories at best.
11/01/2025, 12:27 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes ..

11/01/2025, 7:54 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: 34 gm protein.. fish and cottage cheese
11/01/2025, 9:03 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): label looks flawed

Just log it as plain full fat yogurt
11/01/2025, 9:19 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Calories in 100g of sweet potatoes?

20-21g carbs

11/01/2025, 2:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Won’t matter much cause chicken is like 5-10g at best. 

You can just track rice and oil
11/01/2025, 2:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken
Cornflour 
And oil 

Or even fried chicken entries with sauce can work.
11/01/2025, 2:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or search the name of the dish and add 126g of it
11/01/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I addrd black pepper chicken
11/01/2025, 2:38 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Is that alright?
11/01/2025, 2:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Black pepper chicken isn’t deep fried. This is, so this will be much higher in calories.
11/01/2025, 3:05 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk
11/01/2025, 6:34 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: <Media omitted>

Plain glazed
11/01/2025, 6:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, it's not! Unless you're only weighing the batter.
If it's deep fried then the pakora will have tons of calories (mostly from oil)
11/01/2025, 6:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Mini/small donuts are between 100-180 kcals each
@60193244266 knows this better, the OD guys are his friends!
11/01/2025, 6:46 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Kya search krun us k lie?

11/01/2025, 6:58 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: But i had half pakora
11/01/2025, 6:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 200
11/01/2025, 6:58 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Yea mfp showed 240 for dunkin plain glazed
11/01/2025, 6:59 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I used that as it is
11/01/2025, 6:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That works too.

11/01/2025, 6:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: OD ka mini glazed is 200. And full is around 260 if I remember correctly
11/01/2025, 7:00 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Sizes are pretty different though 
No?
Big one I thought would be like 300
11/01/2025, 7:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The additional calories are pretty much just the extra flour. 

Oil and sugar content is almost similar
11/01/2025, 7:06 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ok
11/01/2025, 11:07 pm - You removed PF - Parishy Noor

12/01/2025, 6:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes apko alag sy oil add krna paryga mostly
12/01/2025, 6:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depending upon the quantity deep fried ma genrly 3-4tsp per piece but if its too oily then 5tsp b hoskta hai
12/01/2025, 6:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For a chicken piece, you can use entries from kfc too.

Hey! How can i measure this lean beef biryani? Its 150 grams rice and 80 grams of beef .. and oil?
12/01/2025, 7:41 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
Also its 150 grams of chicken from chicken achari handi .. what about oil in this ?
12/01/2025, 7:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Log it as 
150g white rice (2-3tsp oil)
80g ground beef 80/20 (1-1.5tsp oil)
12/01/2025, 7:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): iska bone weight 30-35g hoga approx.
so log it as 115-120g chicken breast (2tsp oil)
12/01/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: There is no separate oil, its one dish 

Like cooked beef with white rice in it

Then still i need to add oil separately for both? <This message was edited>
12/01/2025, 7:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then for both as a whole add 3.5tsp oil 
is it lamb or beef ?
12/01/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Beef
12/01/2025, 7:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): oky 
80g ground beef 80/20
12/01/2025, 7:52 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>

12/01/2025, 8:56 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: <Media omitted>
Does this seem appropriate entries for Chinese Ginsoy?
Includes
1 bowl of hot and sour soup
About 1/2 serving of chicken veggie chowmein (Filled up almost the plate?) 
Gravy chicken about 1/2 cup

Sorry couldn’t take a picture of the meals. But this is how I thought I’d guesstimate. 

Can’t believe I ate lesser than normal and it still got to 1000 cals lol.
12/01/2025, 8:56 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: <Media omitted>
12/01/2025, 8:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks good to me
12/01/2025, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can be. Depends on the portions so really hard to judge without pictures.
12/01/2025, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But yeah, if you were trying to control then 1000-1200 is realistic.

12/01/2025, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d say this is pretty solid.
12/01/2025, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But this looks more than 45g pistachio cream

12/01/2025, 10:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: lekin pretty nahi rahega
12/01/2025, 10:54 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Maybe this has been asked before, so sorry about repetition. Frozen paratha is to be tracked frozen(44g) or cooked(38g)? Had half but have tracked it as 44 to be on the safe side.

13/01/2025, 2:13 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 50 grams of pistachios with shells will yield approximately 25-30 grams of shelled pistachios. Here's a breakdown of their nutritional content (approximate values for shelled pistachios):

Calories: 140-160 kcal
Protein: 5-6 grams
Carbohydrates: 8-9 grams (2-3 grams of fiber)
Fats: 11-12 grams (mostly healthy unsaturated fats)

accurate?
13/01/2025, 2:17 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I need to track fried fish 152g (weigh without fish bones) , which entry should I add from below. Pls guide.

13/01/2025, 9:07 am - PF - Sadia Subhan: ?
13/01/2025, 9:13 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes you can track as porridge or we can guesstimate n track as 150ml milk & 50g oats
13/01/2025, 9:14 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its better to weigh milk before making porridge & weigh raw oats
13/01/2025, 9:16 am - PF - Asma Tariq: @923441183411 can you pls let me know about fish entry which I asked.
13/01/2025, 9:21 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): fish has more fat than this so i wont use this entry 
search for trout or carp fish
13/01/2025, 9:21 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>
13/01/2025, 9:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): For marination if you used besan then add that accordingly & if it was deep fried then i would add 3-4tsp oil
13/01/2025, 9:25 am - PF - Sadia Subhan: I didnt made this otherwise i would have measured
13/01/2025, 9:26 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Bought it from outside "some sardar fish shop". And I separated the skin. 

3-4 tsp oil right?
13/01/2025, 9:30 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes per piece
13/01/2025, 1:23 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Dipit Sugar Free option is pretty good - can save on cals if you like ketchup.
13/01/2025, 1:47 pm - PF - Farah Salman: No difference in the calories though
13/01/2025, 1:47 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I've cheked the label
13/01/2025, 1:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's a 'no-added sugar' option, not sugar free!
Still got the same-ish calories
13/01/2025, 1:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: my bad
13/01/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Farah Salman: When a banana is yellow, it has more weight, and when it turns brown 
The weight decreases?
13/01/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Farah Salman: What abt the calories?
13/01/2025, 2:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: The calorie difference between ripe and overripe bananas is minimal- they're essentially the same!
The weight decreases as bananas turn brown due to water loss, but calories are based on nutrients, not water content.
13/01/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: <Media omitted>
This seems OK?
13/01/2025, 2:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: This looks good for raw ground beef entry!
13/01/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: But what about if it's cooked?
13/01/2025, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Let me summarize how I do raw to cooked transformations. 


Meats: Cooked weight x 1.35 = Raw weight 

So 100g cooked chicken is about 135g raw chicken. 

If you select both these entries, you’ll see they are almost identical. 

For rice and pasta: Raw weight X 3 

is cooked weight. 

Again, you’ll see 100g rice and 300g cooked rice are almost identical entries. 

There’s also some over estimation built in here just to be safe.
13/01/2025, 2:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it's cooked 112gm, then you multiply it by 1.35 and you'll get raw weight, i.e. ~151g
13/01/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Awesome saving this thnxxx
13/01/2025, 2:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yess!!
And we'll be sure to add it in our newsletter too, so you have this information handy (and much much more!) :)
13/01/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Sana Imran: <Media omitted>
This entry looks fine ?
13/01/2025, 2:46 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Also I did my one hour workout but in the app it’s only showing steps and not exercise calories
13/01/2025, 2:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: The entries? Or the tracking?

It'd be more accurate if you tracked in grams and not plates, cups, etc.
13/01/2025, 2:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: We don't track calories burned during exercise- it serves no purpose!
13/01/2025, 3:29 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Both
13/01/2025, 3:29 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Just trying to learn if I’m doing it correctly
13/01/2025, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Both are fine tbh, but for more accuracy, if you tracked it in grams, that'd give more accurate numbers/results
13/01/2025, 3:56 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Il try to do it in grams but the problem is in MFP sometimes the option is not there to convert it in grams.. or is there any other way to do it?
13/01/2025, 4:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: All good entries would. You just have to change it from the serving size.
13/01/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Oh ok great thank you
13/01/2025, 5:53 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I m having methi aloo

13/01/2025, 10:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t have to be super precise though with those veggies.
13/01/2025, 10:22 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Okay its just going to be an experiment for now 😂

Shami kabab (sabrso)
65gm ~ 94 cal
Protein 9.7g
Fat 3.2g
Carbs 8.4g

Chicken quantity was very low btw. 
I added 2tsp for both kabab in MFP. These were not oily..
14/01/2025, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Only if you bake it lol
14/01/2025, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Should be fine. Oil can be higher though. Just add an extra tsp or so for safety
14/01/2025, 5:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Done!

15/01/2025, 12:13 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Plz track for me
15/01/2025, 2:14 am - Taha Ahmed: Looks like:
4 chicken tenders - 22gm each (usual weight)
1 big seekh kebab - (40-50gm)
Fries - I'd use half a serving of mcdonalds fries 
1.5tsp mayo
And no oil I guess, like you said!
15/01/2025, 2:23 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Mcdonald fries entry is without oil?
15/01/2025, 2:28 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha no, but I'd do it and move on (to make up for the unaccountable factors beyond our ability to guesstimate)

Is this fine for cooked beef mince
15/01/2025, 2:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, protein is not enough - cooked 200g beef should have atleast 45-50g of protein
15/01/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: What should I search?
15/01/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Just ground beef?
15/01/2025, 2:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Use this entry!
If you weighed cooked beef, multiply 200 x 1.35 to get the raw beef numbers
15/01/2025, 2:18 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
15/01/2025, 2:21 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Should I add oil separately then?

15/01/2025, 2:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes!

15/01/2025, 2:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: OMG nooooo! You added 513 servings, not grams!
1 serving is probably 180-240g I guess
15/01/2025, 2:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the serving. Really difficult to say how much you had without pictures. 

But probably not 1100 unless you had like 2-3 plates.
15/01/2025, 2:47 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Oh right, hahahahaha

15/01/2025, 2:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Loads of rice and oil <This message was edited>
15/01/2025, 2:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you have time, break it down 
400g boiled rice

15/01/2025, 5:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think the white thing is pretty much sugar
15/01/2025, 5:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or maybe sugar and some fat.
15/01/2025, 5:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But this can work
15/01/2025, 5:51 pm - PF - Farah Salman: U think is se ziada hoga calories?

15/01/2025, 6:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,
I have a query in my mind.

In lentils,  we usually use water to cook it. Right. 
When we are weighing it as cooked lentils for MFP, as it is hi weight add kerain. Water weight nhe hota? Mostly some cooked lentils are very liquid. 

I hope you can understand what I'm trying to ask. 🙄
15/01/2025, 6:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. 

Raw lentils 100g is about 300-400g cooked lentils. So if you’re using a cooked entry then that’s taking that into account.
15/01/2025, 6:31 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Got it. Thanks!
15/01/2025, 6:46 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: One more thing.

Lamb paaaye mai kitni calories hoti hain? Plus oil estimation (not home made of course) 
Or how can it be tracked all nashta? 

Thinking of this desi nashta to have. 🙊
15/01/2025, 6:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It will be high in calories cause it’s pretty much just fat
15/01/2025, 6:51 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Any guess estimation? 
We will probably go for this breakfast soon 🙊
15/01/2025, 6:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A bowl can be 400-500

Is it a correct label? 

Pls guide. I'm curious 😮
15/01/2025, 9:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah looks decent.
15/01/2025, 9:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But calories look low. I think this doesn’t have oil
15/01/2025, 9:41 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yeah
15/01/2025, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. If the bar is 8g
15/01/2025, 9:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
15/01/2025, 9:42 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes it is. 

Wow. Good to fulfil chocolate cravings 🎉

15/01/2025, 9:43 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
@60193244266its saying 100 ml of it has 436 calories, but in the description they are measuring it with oil and water and then they are saying 1tbpn has 15 ml. What to add without water and oil? I used 10 grams of this powder
15/01/2025, 9:43 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Should I log this?
15/01/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: His looks like pomfret waisay. So probably much higher. 

1100-1200 for just the fish
15/01/2025, 9:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search pomfret and use that
15/01/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
15/01/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Its good to have bite sized or smaller versions of these treats at home instead of bigger bars. I tend to forget that the portion can be taken some other time as well 💀
15/01/2025, 9:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add around 50 calories of it and move on.
15/01/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Ummm ok but just for the future actually i used this one alot 👀
15/01/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I don’t have that much calories left for this and currently I am at a party with friends.what should I do now?I have just 200 calories left
15/01/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just do 10g ka 50 calories. 

I can’t figure out what the pack says. 

We might be overestimating it but that’s a bonus.
15/01/2025, 9:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or see how much powder are the recommending to add for 100ml and how much oil. And then break it down to see how many calories come from the oil (the remaining will be the powder)
15/01/2025, 9:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol bro. You couldn’t have had an entire fish in 200 calories anyway
15/01/2025, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just eat half of it and you’ll likely be around maintenance calories for today then.

15/01/2025, 10:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 125-130g. Lamb doesn’t look much.

15/01/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i started being back on track after 2 weeks of holiday season today 😅
15/01/2025, 11:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the size of the slice.
15/01/2025, 11:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nah. Slip the salad. Do 4tsp oil if the rice were oily.

15/01/2025, 11:32 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: No bun
15/01/2025, 11:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They don’t use oil to grill burger patties waisay
15/01/2025, 11:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The beef fat cooks the patty generally
15/01/2025, 11:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But to be safe 1.5tsp laga lo
15/01/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Do we need to track imlii pulp as well?

16/01/2025, 4:42 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): This rus
16/01/2025, 4:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Use this or similar to this.
16/01/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Attached what Ali shared previously
16/01/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many grams was it? 

The doodh pati depends on how much milk and sugar you added. 

Since doodpati is mostly milk i would add 1 cup milk to it. So that 150 calories. And then 1-3tsp sugar.
16/01/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This can easily be 250-300 calories in total
16/01/2025, 4:59 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): 230 ml milk for tea and rus weight is 9 gram
16/01/2025, 5:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then log those. 

You can find a risk entry for 9g. Won’t be much if it’s just 9g.
16/01/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: <Media omitted>
How much would this be in calories? 
Its like a pasta kinda salad? Its not made at home so idk much- but has pasta, apple, peas, carrots
16/01/2025, 5:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just do 10g of apple, 10g peas, 20g cooked pasta and 15h mayo
16/01/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): <Media omitted>

16/01/2025, 6:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): boiled potato entry will work if no oil used & for pickle i guess shan has a label on the jar for calories
16/01/2025, 6:16 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Ok i will use that label :) thanks
16/01/2025, 6:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah you can find cooked sweet potato.

Hello, how many calories and how much protien would be in a generic sourdough bread slice. This slice is 51grams.
17/01/2025, 11:49 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>
17/01/2025, 12:01 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Thank you
17/01/2025, 2:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Where do you buy sourdough in Pakistan? Stores ?
17/01/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Just curious . When I was in Pakistan there were not many options to buy breads. We all grew up eating white bread . 

How much is sourdough bread over there ???
17/01/2025, 2:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: I like:

Baked in Lahore
Loafology in Islamabad 
Fresh basket in Karachi 

Usually costs between 1000-1500 I think
17/01/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Syed Iftikhar Ali: <Media omitted>
Is the same Mutton shami kabab?
17/01/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So expensive ..
17/01/2025, 2:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Depends on the size tbh. 
The small ones are b/w 600-800
17/01/2025, 2:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Depends on the kebab's size and weight as well!
if it's a tiny kebab then this seems okay - but you'll have to track oil separately (used in cooking)

I'd suggest weighing one and then tracking the ingredients in it, might be more accurate <This message was edited>
17/01/2025, 2:11 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's been 13 years  . So it's just shocking the prices.. we buy here for 3£ for sourdough and 1.80£ for normal bread ., which is similar to that price. But it's really surprising. Being healthy must be so expensive in Pakistan
17/01/2025, 2:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: White bread is just as healthy- just less nutritious, maybe. It’s fine to eat that too! Yes, some foods here are considered 'fancy' or a 'luxury,' and they end up costing way more than they should. That’s capitalism for you- luxury and profit often go hand in hand here! (abhi Ramzan mai dekhna kya hota hai- a dozen banana that usually cost 100-150rs will cost over 450rs lmao)

That said, being healthy doesn’t have to mean buying expensive items. It's about balance, variety, and making smart choices with what’s accessible. :)
17/01/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: This is from loafology in Islamabad. There are a number of outlets now that make pretty good sourdough
17/01/2025, 2:17 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Yeah, but white bread is not half as delicious :)
17/01/2025, 2:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I love sourdough bread and I explored food here much better than Pakistan. It must have improved over there now. But I was so nutrient deficient and skinny .. there was no awareness then..
17/01/2025, 2:18 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Loafology sourdough is around 450 or 500
17/01/2025, 2:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: That's not bad
17/01/2025, 2:19 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sourdough is really nice

17/01/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Whats the difference?
17/01/2025, 2:21 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: In very much a breakfast person. I need a good breakfast. I am happy using half my calories in breakfast if need be, but an unsatisfactory breakfast would put me in a bad mood all day. So, it is my daily indulgence i guess. <This message was edited>

17/01/2025, 3:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was so scared to eat this much before ...
17/01/2025, 3:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: What was your thought process then? And what is it like now?
What's changed and how? And how does that make you feel overall? 
I'd love to hear more!
17/01/2025, 3:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was very proud of eating less. And very proud of telling people mujhe to bhook he nahi lagati. Will graze and finish off my kids leftovers and think. What's the point of eating now. It will be double food if I eat my own portion.
17/01/2025, 3:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My daily calories must be like 800 900... Weight decreased post partum but then got stuck. Then I started intermittent fasting 16 hours 18 hours even someday one meal a day. Us se Bhi weight Kum hua. Magar bohat saray problems hue. Knee pain hair loss.
17/01/2025, 3:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Eating out and having indulgence. Straight guilt and punishing behaviour of missing meals next day.
17/01/2025, 3:36 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Bein honest, my approach was also the same i was eating too less which affected my sleep cycle. I had insomnia. I used to fast whole day and take one meal with very less calories but my weight still didnot budge :P 


Now i m tracking calories and i m having that guilt inside me that may be i m eating more or may be i m not tracking correct how can i eat so much in these 1400 calories. Sometimes i send snippets in the group and ask if my tracking is correct or not. 😩
17/01/2025, 3:37 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: With the tough routine i have i should fall asleep the moment i take the step inside home. 

But now i m eating correct i m sleeping fine.

17/01/2025, 11:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): naan quantity should be logged half at max 
Oil around 2tbsp would be fine
17/01/2025, 11:40 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: This was a huge naan, i only took 1/4. No idea abt the weight. That’s a quarter sized plate it’s on.
17/01/2025, 11:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for this quantity of naan, half is fine
17/01/2025, 11:50 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: That entry is for 100g. Should i leave it as is?
17/01/2025, 11:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): change it to like 60g

18/01/2025, 12:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: The weight is not just ground beef since there's lentils in there too
18/01/2025, 12:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: <Media omitted>
Should I just go with ground beef?
18/01/2025, 12:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: No no
18/01/2025, 12:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: What to do?
18/01/2025, 12:30 pm - PF - Fatima Zaheer joined from the community
18/01/2025, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, so what I personally do is:

If I weigh a kebab and it’s, say, 100g, I’ll log 40g cooked split chickpeas and 40g meat (ignoring the onions, chilies, etc., because they’re not calorie-dense).

I keep it simple and stick to this approach no matter how it’s made- everyone’s recipe is different, and honestly, I’d rather not overcomplicate it!
18/01/2025, 12:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay perfect
18/01/2025, 12:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: You mean 60g meat @923343773307 ?
18/01/2025, 12:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, no
It's 40g meat, 40g split chickpeas (the other 20g are just onions, chilies, etc.) 😊
18/01/2025, 12:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay right, thank you!!
18/01/2025, 12:38 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: <Media omitted>
This seems okay for lentils?
18/01/2025, 12:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g boiled chickpeas has about 160 kcals

So 34gm should have around 55 kcals
18/01/2025, 12:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: So this is lentils because that's what we put in our kababs
18/01/2025, 12:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Chana daal, right?
18/01/2025, 12:47 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Yup
18/01/2025, 12:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's split chickpeas
18/01/2025, 12:47 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Oh what no way

18/01/2025, 12:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Better
18/01/2025, 12:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So for kebabs, I’ve actually tracked when my mother in law makes them
18/01/2025, 12:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If the kebab is 100g

There’s 65g beef and 35g cooked lentils in her. 

So that’s how I track. 

Lentils and chickpeas can both work.
18/01/2025, 12:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay cool, thank you!
18/01/2025, 1:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay this is coming out to be more overall calories so I'll go with this just in case

18/01/2025, 3:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): definitely not 2000 calories 
you had a large serving or a medium one

18/01/2025, 4:27 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: With one bar then how much?
18/01/2025, 4:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): one bar looks like 20-25g so with one bar additional 110-130 calories
18/01/2025, 4:31 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Notes thanks
18/01/2025, 4:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I would go with 1180.

18/01/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Protein is also likely high cause that’s thick grilled chicken
18/01/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Ya just an idea for the sandwich not the fries ( I didn’t have them)
18/01/2025, 5:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 850-900 without fries

18/01/2025, 10:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 4 is better since you had samosa too
18/01/2025, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: By the way, those samosa are I think bite size ones.
18/01/2025, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Track fish and oil
18/01/2025, 11:06 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I know. The samosa which I had was of two bites.
18/01/2025, 11:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay
18/01/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: <Media omitted>
Is this right?
18/01/2025, 11:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the fish type.
18/01/2025, 11:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But should work for now <This message was edited>

19/01/2025, 12:17 am - PF - Farah Salman: If i take a litre of low-fat milk, that's around 400 cals and 34g protein 
And i make a cottage cheese out of it..using salt  Or vinegar 
That 1 litre milk makes around  200-300gms of cheese, leaving behind 700gms of water (which we usually discard or maybe can use in protein shakes???)

Now that chunni si amount of cottage cheese will have 400 cals and 34 gms protein? <This message was edited>
19/01/2025, 12:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not exactly. 

A lot of the liquid you discard is just whey, so you’re discarding some protein and some calories too.
19/01/2025, 12:35 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: Is it better to make cottage cheese in full fat milk?
19/01/2025, 12:37 am - PF - Farah Salman: So how to track the cottage cheese calories then?
19/01/2025, 1:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use regular cottage cheese calories. 

Or use low fat cottage cheese ki calories if making it from low fat milk.

19/01/2025, 2:11 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>

19/01/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: What do should enter then for without bones
19/01/2025, 2:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: You could track it as chicken thigh boneless (246g)
19/01/2025, 2:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Pretty much the same fat/protein content in both leg and thigh
19/01/2025, 2:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thigh has 2-3gm more protein and fat per 100g

19/01/2025, 8:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): thats for raw bro
19/01/2025, 8:07 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Raw is also showing high here
19/01/2025, 8:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): raw 150g has around 30g
19/01/2025, 8:15 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Raw or cooked chicken breast ke protein content may kya difference hota hay?
19/01/2025, 8:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro raw has water weight too so when u cook it to wo water weight nikal jata hai 
Thats why 30g protein k leay raw apko zada quantity ma lena hoga n cooked ki quantity km hogi
19/01/2025, 8:22 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
19/01/2025, 8:22 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And this entry is fine?
19/01/2025, 8:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for raw 150 no

19/01/2025, 8:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>
19/01/2025, 8:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s for one chicken breast. Approximately 150g. 

Not exactly. 

150g of raw chicken breast is around 30-33g
19/01/2025, 8:29 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ye entry correct hay for cooked chicken breast 120g
19/01/2025, 8:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Should be okay

19/01/2025, 8:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Let's say adding a tbsp of vinegar before your meal lowers the glucose spike, what happens to the calories (energy) then? Where does it go? 

And as desis, we cook most of our meals with vinegar if not all, why is 58% of our population overweight and out of which, 48% is clinically obese? 

If vinegar worked that way, we'd be the healthiest of all.

Just some things to think over!! <This message was edited>

20/01/2025, 10:28 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Sharp cheddar is aged more
20/01/2025, 10:29 am - Taha Ahmed: Then probably this^
If it’s aged, it means it’s more dried up = more calorie-dense. <This message was edited>
20/01/2025, 10:30 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay cool, thank you!

20/01/2025, 1:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe ask them if they added sugar

20/01/2025, 6:46 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: What entry do you suggest?
20/01/2025, 6:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Around ~100-120 kcal
20/01/2025, 6:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sorry, it was for Barfi
20/01/2025, 6:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is probably for raw urad daal chilka
20/01/2025, 6:53 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: I have a confusion in tracing daals on mfp like they usually cooked wit water so first i dont know how to track it and second which entry to use it?
20/01/2025, 6:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can track it as 30g raw urad chilka instead of 120g cooked
20/01/2025, 6:56 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
Whats this entry is for? Can we track like every daal with this entry?
20/01/2025, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, this works!
20/01/2025, 6:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is tricky because everyone makes daal differently and keeps a different consistency as well!
So it's better to track it raw
20/01/2025, 6:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: But the entry you've picked will work too
20/01/2025, 6:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: We don't have to perfect it, we just need to get as close to it as we can (esp. when we're estimating)
20/01/2025, 6:58 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Right.

Cooked in Milk (with water).

20/01/2025, 7:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it 200g

Maybe do 120g cooked sago and 150ml milk (it doesn’t add up to 200 because milk main say water evaporate hoa hoga when cooking)
20/01/2025, 7:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And if it’s sweet then add 2-3tsp sugar
20/01/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Got it.

And a big no to sugar. I added a half date. And a few nuts. Will add these accordingly. <This message was edited>

Hello. Hope you’re doing well. 

Is the nutritional value given here accurate?
22/01/2025, 10:32 am - PF - Abdul Manan: <Media omitted>
22/01/2025, 11:29 am - Taha Ahmed: I am sure that calorie count is correct for the first ever batch- I doubt they make it with same accuracy when they're rushing! They add a lot of sauces etc
So I'd just add 2-3 tsp oil on the side, track it and move on <This message was edited>
22/01/2025, 11:49 am - PF - Abdul Manan: Okay
Thank you!
22/01/2025, 12:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can also be accurate. Since a zinger is 570. And this is pretty much the same. 

But yeah add some extra calories for safety if you want

The calories mentioned for this Caesar salad on their menu are ~1169 kcal (evergreen, Karachi)

How many calories do you think it's got?

I'm sure many don't have pizza on its own, they use some of the chili oil and their special green chimichurri sauce/oil too (in the ramekins)
22/01/2025, 9:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Gajak? A lot of people call it Chikki in Karachi, but in Lahore its a different thing

It was oily and loaded with Caesar dressing 😬
22/01/2025, 11:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I just got shamed for eating calorie dense shortbread fingers. Someone just told me what's the point of measuring food and using less oil when you end up eating sugary snack. 

I'm still under my calorie range . A bit less still. I wanted to ask. Is it ok to enjoy my tea with biscuits ? Or sugar is bad for weight loss or my health ? 

I skipped my lunch . I had some ice cream today too mixed with yoghurt. And dinner I have chicken with couscous salad.
22/01/2025, 11:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I tracked everything
22/01/2025, 11:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
22/01/2025, 11:43 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Sorry to hear this. Mai bhi trigger hogeya hoon. Basically, unhon nay apna fear ap par dal diya hai.
22/01/2025, 11:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: First, let’s address the nonsense you were told. I feel sorry for the person who made you feel this way. The idea that eating something calorie-dense or sweet somehow "negates" your effort is pure diet culture BS- we don't do that here. Your progress isn’t determined by one snack or meal but by your overall habits and consistency. You tracked your intake, stayed within your calorie range, and even enjoyed your day without deprivation- THAT’S what matters.

Sugar isn’t inherently 'bad' for weight loss or health. What matters is balance and moderation. If you’re consistently meeting your nutritional needs esp protein targets, hitting your calorie goals, and FEELING GOOD overall?? A couple of biscuits with tea or some ice cream won’t magically derail you. The person who made that comment likely doesn’t understand how nutrition works and that's what's so annoying about these people.

Trust me-and this is me saying to you as someone who's spent a decade studying this and working with close to a thousand clients - you’re doing the right thing by learning to include foods you enjoy while staying on track- this is how you prevent developing eating disorders and stay healthy not just physically but emotionally and mentally as well. So please, don’t let uninformed opinions make you feel guilty about making progress in a sustainable way- people here won't ever understand that and it's not our job either. Keep going, and fuck em!! Don’t let anyone shame you for eating foods you love and doing it the way that's sustainable and realistic for you.
22/01/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: 🥹 jazakAllah... I love shortbread .. and going through PMS too. So it was triggering
22/01/2025, 11:47 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Ab mera bhi dil chah raha hai shortbread khanay ka 😀
22/01/2025, 11:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: JazakAllah. . I knew that it should be ok. It's been months I haven't got off the track or gave up on slow progress. So I have to share
22/01/2025, 11:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Eating shortbread isn't going off track- agar favourite khanay kha kar kisi ka progress kharab hota hai tou mera tou koi progress he nahi horaha is tarhan, let me show you why :p

23/01/2025, 12:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha
23/01/2025, 12:08 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Anyhow. So I can enjoy my tea with biscuits being accountable for my calories and reaching my protein goal. . 

She also told me ... Ditch sugar and see the progress within weeks. Sugar is the culprit of holding fat.
23/01/2025, 12:08 am - Taha Ahmed: Ditch her!
23/01/2025, 12:08 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And I just stayed quiet . Because I still have my tea with sugar . Not sucralose

I'm trying to maintain my calorie deficit at my best. Somehow I'm on it. But I've been feeling like losing my motivation for a week. And it makes me so stressed out that I might not be making any progress, shayad. It's all underline back in my mind. 🙁

Mai Kia keron? 😣 <This message was edited>
23/01/2025, 1:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why do you feel this way?
23/01/2025, 1:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you been tracking progress?
23/01/2025, 1:45 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Same
23/01/2025, 1:46 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thek ho gya boss 🥹
23/01/2025, 1:48 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I really dont know. I'm having strong tea/coffee  cravings like crazy, caffeine cravings since last week. And sweet too. I have managed it very well though so far.

Actually last week the calorie count was on the edge of the deficit (200-300 more calories than the weekly target) I tracked all right even though I was cheating on some meals. And I felt guilty on the day when I was having more calories. I'm not sleeping properly due to work and some family commitments. 
So it mixed up and complexed. 😬

I'm not tracking progress for the last three weeks. Yeh bhi stress ho raha that I will lose all the progress. <This message was edited>
23/01/2025, 2:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You won’t lose progress since your calorie intake is on point so I wouldn’t worry about that. 

The rest of the to ones are likely because of sleep deprivation. 

We know that when sleep is low, HUNGER AND CRAVINGS GO UP so that’s likely the cause. 

If you can get more sleep, then this should sort itself out. 

If not, then push through till we can sleep better. Till then maybe cut back on workouts slightly or increase daily calories by 200.
23/01/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Asma Tariq: You are right. Will follow it. ❤️

I have one more thing stuck in my mind as well. Which is bothering me.  
Should I go on more deficit? Or I will be making progress with this deficit or not.

Please guide me on this.
23/01/2025, 2:43 am - PF - Asifa Mir: Mera bhi same masla he tee without 1 biscuit not possible 🙄🙄
23/01/2025, 3:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’re having trouble with hunger Abhi and you want to increase deficit? 

Nope, not the right approach for now. 

Plus, we don’t know results so can’t take that decision abhi. 

We can revisit this when sleep improves and hunger goes down. Also when you start tracking progress.
23/01/2025, 8:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Sure, makes sense to me. Well, lets try to fix it all. Thanks! 🙂 <This message was edited>

23/01/2025, 6:51 pm - PF - Nida Umer: But isnt that also coz your daily calorie requirement allows it 

I mean if i eat pizza meri to din ki cals us me khatam hojaingi
23/01/2025, 7:17 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @923441183411 itni ziyada calories per tikki 2 tikkis 500 calories ziyada bi ho sakhti hai size pay bi depend karta hai.
23/01/2025, 7:22 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923002040986 make pizza like @60193244266 does at home. You'll still have plenty cals left over 😁
23/01/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Dil to phir xanders k pizza ka hota he na😂
23/01/2025, 7:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923002040986  You're part right. Yes. My calorie requirement allows for a larger food/calorie intake. But I don't eat everything at once and esp when I am eating out, I share my food with others and keep my meal options limited (only two). 
For instance, yesterday, I shared that pizza and chicken with a friend and we took leftovers home.
We don't aim to finish our food if we're not hungry.
So we still end up with a lot of calories at the end.
I brought the leftover pizza home, ate one more slice and gave the rest to my siblings. ;) 

(some may think I'm being a good brother, but in reality I'm just giving my calories away hahahhaha) 😂 <This message was edited>
23/01/2025, 7:36 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I have been a foodie all my life
And low key i am envious of ppl whose calorie requirement allows them to eat more 🙈

I am trying to record everything thing
Honestly i am still stuggling being in a deficit 

Maintenance i can manage
23/01/2025, 7:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Building more muscle mass and staying more active = higher TDEE 
The higher your TDEE is, the higher the maintenance calories

You know what that means, right? 
You get to eat more food! 😋
(something a true foodie would say to justify eating lots of food lol)

P.S. The Rock once mentioned in his stories that he consumes around 6000-8000 calories a day! 😭 <This message was edited>
23/01/2025, 7:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How do ppl extremely opp the size of rock eat so much?
23/01/2025, 7:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I hv skinny cousins
23/01/2025, 7:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Who dont need to think twice
23/01/2025, 7:41 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How?
23/01/2025, 7:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: You never know what they do behind the scenes :)
Could be EDs, could be them hiding and excessively working out to stay that way, they may also have some underlying health conditions too -but ED is definitely there if someone's eating a lot but not gaining weight. 
It's not a good thing, I think, and it's certainly not healthy!
23/01/2025, 7:45 pm - PF - Nida Umer: ED?
23/01/2025, 7:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ye meny apko ek avrg tikki jo 40-50g ki hoti hai uska btaya hai 
size km hoga to obviously km hogi calories bhi
23/01/2025, 7:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Eating Disorder! <This message was edited>
23/01/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Nida Umer: So u are saying its not metabolism
Like someone actually being built like that
Body structure n genes they do matter right
23/01/2025, 7:51 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: <Media omitted>
Does it seems right?
23/01/2025, 7:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: No!
Maybe you think they eat a lot, because the time you see them eat that way is probably their only meal of the day (so they're not eating a lot of calories)
Yes, their one meal a day seems like a lot of calories but it's probably very much in their daily caloric intake. 🤷🏽‍♂
They could also be highly active everyday, which is why their expenditure is higher and they end up staying the way they are i.e. skinny.

So many different factors at play!

And so if anyone's eating in a surplus, they would definitely gain weight, regardless of their body type (endo, meso, ecto) and the genes... unless they're not eating in a surplus!!
Also, btw, the body types don't matter when it comes to muscle gain or fat loss, etc. <This message was edited>
23/01/2025, 7:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: May have a little bit more calories and less protein!

Gajar ka halwa usually has:
carrots
milk (or khoya)
sugar

the only protein source is milk (aur itna hota nahi hai usme)

23/01/2025, 8:09 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I have seen so mang reela on consuming garlic clove empty stomach or before sleeping.As it clears skin or improves gut health according to that people.
What are your thoughts on this coaches?
23/01/2025, 8:34 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok got it
23/01/2025, 8:34 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I know this is science based, BUT until my mid 30s even, i could eat over 2000 - 2500 calories and not gain. I ate junk like anything. I still worked on a desk job. Didn't have kids, so no running around after them. Hiked 2 km, maybe twice a week. But that's it. Can't stop thinking it was metabolism rather than activities and consumption rate. My body definitely started processing food differently after pregnancies and PPD.
23/01/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’re also a lot more active then. 

And you genuinely don’t remember how much you ate. 

There’s data on this then people overestimate how much they eat when thinking back. 

All my life I was known as the kid with the fast metabolism, I could eat anything and not gain weight. My lunch used to be 4 samosas and a cold drink in university and I weighed 56kgs. 

But then I started tracking. I barely ate 2000 calories. 

Didn’t have breakfast, 4 samosas for dinner and then some for random junk for dinner.
23/01/2025, 9:29 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Also after 30 we lose muscle mass 🫠
23/01/2025, 9:42 pm - PF - Nida Umer: But then
There is is still body structure right
Broader bones n all
And then fat on top of it
😭😭😭

Why lord why😂
23/01/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re not training, then yes.
23/01/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you ever seen a skeleton with broader bones? 🫣
23/01/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah I meant normally people don't
23/01/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Minor differences are obviously there but it’s insignificant.
23/01/2025, 9:53 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I havent seen any skeleton😂

How okay this to have as rushed breakfast this was available in office
24/01/2025, 7:18 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan joined from the community
24/01/2025, 8:56 am - Taha Ahmed: So this is something you can occasionally have if you're skipping breakfast. It's got ~196 kcal and 10g of protein, it's not too bad, but it's nothing great either.

If you had 2 boiled eggs and 1 piece of bread (30ish grams), you'd get 15g of protein and it's got ~240 kcal (this may be more fulfilling as the food's volume is also high)
24/01/2025, 8:57 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: Yes of course thanks fr answering that

24/01/2025, 12:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Naan main as such oil hota nahin. Agar uper say laga hoa hai then add it alag say.
24/01/2025, 12:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Either is fine. They’re usually made with breasts though.
24/01/2025, 12:45 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk

24/01/2025, 4:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, the vitamins and minerals don't have calories!
Omega-3 is basically fish oil (fat), and 1g/1cap has 9 kcal, but we don't track vitamins and minerals AT ALL!
24/01/2025, 4:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: Check its nutritional label at the back
24/01/2025, 4:10 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
24/01/2025, 4:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: So per serving (80g), it has 220 kcals, and not 199 kcals

Is this entry correct for 160gm of mutton biryani. Im confused because 160gm of boiled rice is around 550kcals.
24/01/2025, 5:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Break it into ingredients. 

160g is likely 100g cooked rice and 60g cooked lamb plus 3tsp oil.
24/01/2025, 5:19 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Ok gotcha
24/01/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Cooked rice entry is also only 130kcal for 100g  should i use boiled rice instead? As 100g boiled rice is 352 kcals
24/01/2025, 5:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. That’s fine.
24/01/2025, 5:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cooked 100g rice is 130.
24/01/2025, 5:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g raw rice is 350
24/01/2025, 5:22 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: I had some outdoorsy biryani at a guests place and it had 3 small botis i guess. I had around 150gm of rice
24/01/2025, 5:23 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: 100gm boiled rice is 352
24/01/2025, 5:23 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: Boiled is white rice that we have at home. Correct?
24/01/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: I usually measure boiled rice and enter that in the app <This message was edited>
24/01/2025, 5:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That entry is wrong. 100g boiled rice is same as 100g cooked rice.

Fine?
24/01/2025, 6:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Calories and protein look fine. So you can use it. 
But in reality it will have less carbs and more fat. 

You could just use a zinger entry as well.
24/01/2025, 6:30 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Alrightt
24/01/2025, 6:32 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Zinger entries i found are 20 or 24 g protein is that fine or should it be 30g?

25/01/2025, 4:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s a little bit, then no.
25/01/2025, 4:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re having 200g of it then probably should.

How to calculate calories of this clear chicken soup. I didn’t add any oil but I think this oil on top would be from chicken?
It has chicken, and veggies.
25/01/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just track chicken thigh and veggies.
25/01/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s homemade?
25/01/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Yes
25/01/2025, 4:58 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: But it was a big batch
25/01/2025, 5:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just estimate your portion based on chicken
25/01/2025, 6:00 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: So I approx went over 4100 calories over my maintenance calories
25/01/2025, 6:00 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: We had a friends meetup today and ordered buckets of fried chicken
25/01/2025, 6:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: and then lunch was outside too
25/01/2025, 6:02 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I am thinking to divide these over the next few weeks so that I can average out properly
25/01/2025, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 4100 calories over?
25/01/2025, 6:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You ate 6000 calories or something?
25/01/2025, 6:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Dividing 4000 calories would pretty much be pointless. 

Because you need to do it for weeks to balance it out. 

I’d just go back to regular intake. And kind of come to terms with the fact that this entire week is likely maintenance or a small surplus, depending on other days.
25/01/2025, 6:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yes @60193244266
25/01/2025, 6:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: My guess-estimate

26/01/2025, 5:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can track it as that as well! The calories and macros are pretty much the same <This message was edited>
26/01/2025, 5:09 pm - PF - Syed Iftikhar Ali: What about this?
26/01/2025, 5:11 pm - PF - Syed Iftikhar Ali: <Media omitted>

26/01/2025, 9:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: I had to google and see what poha is
26/01/2025, 9:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Acc, to USDA values, 100g Poha has 350 kcals
26/01/2025, 9:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: 30g would have ~105 kcals, so your entry seems fine <This message was edited>
26/01/2025, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What she had wasn’t poha 🤣
26/01/2025, 9:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: What was it then? :O
26/01/2025, 9:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This
26/01/2025, 9:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Tried searching, it’s likely around 380 per slice.

26/01/2025, 9:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: This should be around 300-400 kcals (flour, sugar, oil, cream cheese, cream, etc.)

Cake ke naam se MyFitnessPal mai search karain, aur servings adjust karke 400 kcals tak track karlain, that's it! <This message was edited>
26/01/2025, 9:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Aap bahir ka cake bhi kha sakti hain, usmei koi masla nahi hai
Bus portion ka pata hona chahye, baaqi guesstimate karke calories etc hum track kar saktay hain
Aur as long as wo aapke calorie or macros intake me easily integrate horaha hai, tou koi farq nahi parta! :)

26/01/2025, 9:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ji theek hai, but aapko protein intake barhana parega- abhi tak sirf 10g huwa hai and you need around 100-110g every day
26/01/2025, 9:35 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: G dineer me boild egss and chicken with saled kr lu gi
26/01/2025, 9:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Phulki -you can track that as lentils dumpling or cooked lentils (both should be fine)
The rest is yogurt and a lil sugar (if it's bought from outside)
So maybe 120g cooked lentils
120g yogurt
10g sugar
26/01/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Nope. Both entries are from different people. 

Yeh Tou Patissa (Meethai) hai. 😂

Pooha is made of rice I think. <This message was edited>

26/01/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): rajma is basically lobiya so just track as cooked kidney bean
26/01/2025, 9:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes meny patisay ki calories btaen 
i'm not sure what poha is made of so uska nhi btaya meny
26/01/2025, 10:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yupe. A chota sa piece is of upto 425kcal.
26/01/2025, 10:09 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Chota nahi tha piece
26/01/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Poha is something Indian dish. Movies and drama mai souni hoe.
26/01/2025, 10:10 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 80-85g patisa isnt chota piece wesy
26/01/2025, 10:11 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I don't grams. In picture, it looks like. 🙊

Raw
26/01/2025, 10:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Then it must be tracked as cooked rice & add oil if used along with any other ingredients if added
26/01/2025, 10:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Track it as rice then
26/01/2025, 10:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh bhi probably theek hai since it’s almost same as rice calories.
26/01/2025, 10:42 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Yes
26/01/2025, 11:03 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Thanks

26/01/2025, 11:42 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I can’t find any exact entry for double melt 
Should i track it as thin crust and separately add cream cheese?
26/01/2025, 11:45 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: This message was deleted
26/01/2025, 11:58 pm - Pf - Shafaq Maqsood: The domino’s app in pakistan provides nutritional info- however coach can guide if it’s accurate or not
27/01/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If so, you can look at it.
27/01/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Otherwise use this.

i got this from baked. i think it said 400 cals
 but I'm not sure. is it 400 okay to log for it?
27/01/2025, 12:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: What's in it exactly, and do you know the serving size? 400 kcal might be accurate, but depending on the ingredients, it could easily be more
27/01/2025, 12:40 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: 10oz it says. 
its some nuts. seeds. chia seeds. oats. kiwi.
27/01/2025, 12:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: A 10 oz serving can easily range from 400 to 500+ kcal depending on the proportions of nuts and seeds, as they are calorie-dense. I'd suggest estimating it around 450 kcal maybe, just to be on the safe side, but logging 400 kcal is reasonable if it aligns with the packaging info
27/01/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: okay thankyou
27/01/2025, 3:17 pm - PF - Farah Salman: <Media omitted>
How accurate do the calories look like?
27/01/2025, 3:17 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Honey is used to sweetend the yogurt too
27/01/2025, 3:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Granola and honey can add calories so not sure. Especially as I don’t know the weight. 

Based on the macros, it should be around 150g Greek yoghurt. 

But then 150g yoghurt is 150-180 calories. 

Unless they use low fat Greek yogurt which will be around 100.
27/01/2025, 3:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And then then other calories come from granola, honey and kiwi.
27/01/2025, 3:48 pm - PF - Farah Salman: So how much should i guesstimate it
I dont think the greek yogurt is low fat <This message was edited>
27/01/2025, 4:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then probably go with 400
27/01/2025, 6:51 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Im craving for chinese takeout

27/01/2025, 7:16 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ok makes sense

27/01/2025, 7:44 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Should I track them as potatoes or use fries or potato chips entry
27/01/2025, 7:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s air fried then it’s just potato
27/01/2025, 7:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And maybe add 1tsp oil just in case

You could also use Nestle Unsweetened Yogurt's entry - it's quite accurate in MFP
27/01/2025, 8:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 150ish in a cup a usually a safe entry.

27/01/2025, 9:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hmm, then 20 20 and 10g cream

15g flour
15g milk
10g sugar
10g cream

the difference in calories won't be that much (maybe 20-30kcal)

28/01/2025, 9:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 100 approx. for a small/medium serving i guess because they add some 7up/sprite too in it along with sugar 
@60193244266 what do you think
28/01/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Farah Salman: If we ask them to add 7up free and no sugar coz 7up is already sweet <This message was edited>
28/01/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Will it be zero cals then
28/01/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if they do that then ofcourse itni calories nhi honi k track krny ki zarurat ho
28/01/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: I think they add sugar too but not sure

#mealpreptip
29/01/2025, 12:43 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Also brown rice vs white rice ? A nutritionist once gave me brown but gym says not much difference. I feel white rice causes bloating
29/01/2025, 12:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: The only difference is in its fiber content and even that's not too much, prob around 1g extra fiber in brown rice / 100g- the rest is pretty much the same!
If white rice makes you feel bloated, try adding some fiber-rich foods with it- it might help! <This message was edited>
29/01/2025, 2:02 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Isbghol ka chilka fiber k liye ager hum daily khaian to Kiya vo sai ha
29/01/2025, 2:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ji bilkul sahi hai!
But daily requirement 25-30g hoti hai
Aik tbpn ispaghol taqreeban 3-5gm hota hai - sirf ye kha kar fiber intake pura nahi hosakta, isliye behtar hai ke aap fruits aur vegetables ka istemaal bhi karain, aur whole-foods like lentils and legumes (daal, chana, beans, etc) aur whole-grains like oats etc ka bhi istemaal karain
29/01/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Isphaghol has calories?
29/01/2025, 2:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: 10g ispaghol has around 20kcals I believe

29/01/2025, 3:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not if you’re eating 4-5 pieces of fruit and vegetables daily.
29/01/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I also noticed the days I'm not active and not working out . I feel more hungry. . Is that mental thing ? Or my body needs more fuel ?
29/01/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I don't binge.  I have meals
29/01/2025, 4:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s just that you likely have more free time

29/01/2025, 5:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: They both can be good or bad for weight loss (depending on how much you're eating)
if you eat in a surplus, that'll lead to weight gain
if you fit it in your deficit, you'll lose weight (regardless of the flour) :)

Tou aapki personal preference pe depend karta hai
29/01/2025, 5:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Lol ye extremely local products MFP pe nahi honge, only somewhat established brands have their foods in global database (like peak freans, LU, English biscuits, etc.)
29/01/2025, 5:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Quick add ka option use karke (make your own entry)
29/01/2025, 5:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's better if you track it anyway

29/01/2025, 7:12 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): The cup in your image is from Peshawari Ice Cream (PIC), and based on its design, it appears to be their 150ml cup. This is a common serving size for their single-serving ice cream cups. However, exact confirmation would require checking with the brand or store.

Three deep fried potato cutlets. They were thinly coated with besan. I have tracked it as 200g raw potatoes, 15ml oil and 20gm gram flour. Is this fine?
30/01/2025, 2:33 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923005000170 80% lean meat and 20% fat content. The proportions basically
30/01/2025, 2:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: 150-220 kcal (if you weighed it, you can track more accurately) + oil! <This message was edited>
30/01/2025, 2:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Around 200-250 kcal (looks like a big serving)
30/01/2025, 2:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: You don't use MFP or MacrosFirst for food tracking?
30/01/2025, 2:35 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Without crackers?
30/01/2025, 2:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes! 
If you had prawn crackers, they're high in calories cause they're deep fried in oil... 100g has around 560ish kcal
30/01/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Didnt have crakers shukar
Just the soup
30/01/2025, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good, if it's deep fried then oil might be a little bit more
30/01/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I don’t have my weight scale with me
30/01/2025, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Around 1-2tsp per cutlet
30/01/2025, 2:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then just pick a standard shami kebab entry you might have used before and use that to track this as well

Never used the app so won't know how accurate the entries would be!

900g /12 = 75ish g / slice

that's ~350-400 calories

30/01/2025, 5:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: You'll be able to fit it in your intake quite well

30/01/2025, 5:29 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: So i create a recepie on mfp and added raw daal and everything
And the calories are coming out very low, i think
30/01/2025, 5:29 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Lentil before cooking was 70 grams and i make 6 portions of it which after cooking is 68,3 grams for one portion
30/01/2025, 5:31 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: <Media omitted>
This from recepie is 62 calories with butter oil and creame
30/01/2025, 5:34 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Iska half 🥹
30/01/2025, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s accurate. 70g raw daal tou main akela khata hoon
30/01/2025, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So if you divide it into 6 portions then calories will be low
30/01/2025, 6:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is this is just strawberries and chocolate then you can try to track it as strewberries and Nutella. But this looks like a lot of Nutella.
30/01/2025, 6:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And Taha is right, you can easily make this yourself and control calories.
30/01/2025, 6:36 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Will.make it with dairymilk or some dark chocolate 
This way it will be easier to track
30/01/2025, 6:36 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Thxx
30/01/2025, 6:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Nutella is easier since it’s already a liquid but you can use any chocolate.

30/01/2025, 7:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can get any steak of your liking (they'll all have over a thousand calories). What you can do is either share it with someone or have half of it and take away the leftovers and eat it tomorrow
30/01/2025, 7:31 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok

Iski entry kaise kro MFP may? I have less than half of it
30/01/2025, 7:58 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: You’ll have to estimate the weight of the meat - or ask the server if they know and enter that as one item, and then everything else separately like the sauce and sides (try to guesstimate how many tablespoons of suace is on there) (or you could ask the server to give you the sauce on the side so you can add it to your plate yourself)
30/01/2025, 8:00 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: The total weight of steak was 250g
30/01/2025, 8:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Usual serving size at restaurants is between 6-8oz (165-220g). Ask them how much it is and then track that, plus oil/butter (atleast 60-80g) that's around 4-5.5tbsp butter/oil
30/01/2025, 8:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Plus add BBQ sauce separately (use any entry like Knorr's bbq or national's bbq sauce) :)
30/01/2025, 8:03 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
30/01/2025, 8:06 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this fine?
30/01/2025, 8:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro add steak & sauces separately

30/01/2025, 8:09 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for steak just enter 80/20 beef if its beef steak & add sauces, oil/butter alag sy
30/01/2025, 8:09 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
30/01/2025, 8:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also if total was 250 then add 125 if you had almost half. Better to overestimate than under.

1. Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. Mix dates, tahini and 3 Tbsp (45 mL) water in a food
processor and blend until creamy.
3. And all ingredients to a large bowl and mix to combine.
4. Spread granola evenly on baking paper and press flat.
Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, stopping one
or two times to stir and flatten again if needed to prevent
burning and to ensure the granola cooks evenly.
5. Let cool and transfer to an airtight container to store.
Enjoy with smoothies, plant-based yogurts or on its own
as a snack.

*NOTES*
*If dry, soak in warm water until softened, drain.
**Organic raisins are optional, but recommended, as
grapes tend to be a food very high in pesticide use.
Variations: swap for your own desired raw nuts, raw
seeds, and dried fruit to change it up.
Storage: store in an airtight container on the counter
for up to two weeks.

Hey 
I just wanna ask that in my BMI test 
My BMR is low 
Is that the reason my weight is stuck 
As I follow my diet and exercise
01/02/2025, 3:37 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Should yogurt still be accounted for if chicken is marinated and then cooked in it?
01/02/2025, 3:37 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Yup
01/02/2025, 9:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally yes. If it’s just 10-30g then you can skip and probably won’t make a big difference but if you want to be accurate then track it
01/02/2025, 9:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: These tests aren’t accurate especially for calculating BMRs.
01/02/2025, 9:21 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
Trying to track this but struggling with portioning. Rice was not a whole cup. Not sure what the weight of the chicken and fries would be - I had two pieces of chicken
01/02/2025, 9:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 150g cooked rice. 
Nandos quarter chicken leg piece 
Small fries McDonald’s.
01/02/2025, 9:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you had two pieces then add two of those
01/02/2025, 9:23 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: They’re sweet potato fries
01/02/2025, 9:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s fine. Calories are similar
01/02/2025, 9:28 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
Probably over estimating? But ok right?
01/02/2025, 9:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah the rice is likely half of that
01/02/2025, 9:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rest is decent.

01/02/2025, 4:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: In a pan
01/02/2025, 4:31 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Boiled the water and put eggs cover them. That's it

01/02/2025, 4:31 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I had in hotels

01/02/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Will try the pan to see if the taste is different
01/02/2025, 4:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I don't know how to do that. It's just randomly I made ...

01/02/2025, 10:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,
Brown/organic Egg (Desi-Home based Farm) Vs White Egg (Farm Egg). Is there any difference in calories or macros? Enlighten pls. <This message was edited>
01/02/2025, 10:10 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): calories & macros are kinda similar if both eggs weigh the same 
Some minerals & vitamins are higher in desi and some are higher in farmi. But the overall difference is pretty much nothing
01/02/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Alright. 

I don't weigh eggs actually 70-72 calories in a normal white egg.  Am I Right?
01/02/2025, 10:17 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Guesstimate plz... baguette with corn and cheese 109 grams
01/02/2025, 10:17 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 109 is the overall weight
01/02/2025, 10:33 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes white/farmi egg is around that but desi chota hota hai around 50-55g normally
01/02/2025, 10:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Okay.
01/02/2025, 10:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Thanks.
01/02/2025, 10:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 300ish would be a fair estimate

I forgot to weigh it before cooking but it was 1 pear that I just peeled and boiled/reduced with stick of cinnamon cuz it was about to go bad - thought it would be a good dessert - do it log it as 1 pear?
02/02/2025, 4:18 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: also it is SO SWEET 10/10 recommend making sugar free compotes of fruits that are about to go bad!
02/02/2025, 4:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. A pear is usually close to 100g in my experience
02/02/2025, 4:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d add that to my Greek yoghurt uffff

I wanted to ask if this is safe to consume. I take around 1.3gm 3,4 times a week in chai. My parents say that this weakens muscles.
02/02/2025, 2:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes its absolutely safe to use stevia or any artificial sweetener for that matter
02/02/2025, 2:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: Thankyou

02/02/2025, 4:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And it has nothing to do with weakening muscles. 

We blames these things for muscle loss and don’t do the one thing that actually prevents muscle loss - lifting weights.
02/02/2025, 4:23 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: Forwarding this to mom

02/02/2025, 5:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The one on the packaging is likely correct.
02/02/2025, 5:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: These are semi cooked
02/02/2025, 5:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And you don’t need to boil them
02/02/2025, 5:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add them to hot water
02/02/2025, 5:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Used a lot in Malaysia and Japan.
02/02/2025, 5:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: This shows that a 50g serving has 14g carbs, so you can just adjust the serving size in MFP to match 14g carbs 👍
02/02/2025, 6:05 pm - PF - Farah Salman: awesome

two tbsp paneer reshmi handi
one rango kebab
two malai boti
02/02/2025, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Really difficult to guess without knowing the size.
02/02/2025, 10:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Half naan can be 150-200
Rest maybe 100g chicken
3tsp oil
3tsp butter

02/02/2025, 10:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then likely 250-300. Because the full naan is huge.
02/02/2025, 10:52 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: If you are in Islamabad, Soho uses these noodles in their Bangkok Noodles dish. Super good, chicken, veggies, chillies, and no heavy sauces.

03/02/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Ok here goes - promise not being condescending just really breaking it down: 
Take 1 pear 
Peel it and slice it 
Throw it in a pan with a little water - about 1/2 a cup 
Throw in a cinnamon stick or powder 
Cook over low heat for however long - till it kinda looks caramel like and the water is gone and it tastes like jam

06/02/2025, 4:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, you can add KFC's zinger's entry
06/02/2025, 4:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did it taste as good though? 👀😋
06/02/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It was fine. Lol. 
During a  training session, I didn't focus on the taste btw. 😳

But the americano which I had after the session was quite 🙊
06/02/2025, 4:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Which entry of KFC zinger is right?
I mean calories and protein. Guide pls.

06/02/2025, 5:49 pm - PF - Nida Umer: So i need to explain to my fam that the malai removed from milk still leaves fat in the milk
They dont agree with my low fat milk packets 🙈

Help
06/02/2025, 5:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Even after removing malai, milk still contains fat (fresh milk!) - just in smaller amounts tho. Regular milk has around ~3.5% fat, and even after skimming malai, it’s not completely fat-free. Low-fat milk packets are just a more consistent way to reduce fat intake without compromising on protein and calcium!
06/02/2025, 5:54 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thanx

Can i just add one entry and round it up to 400 rather then entering sep items
06/02/2025, 5:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: ~1490 kcal 😂

The amount of oil that went into that garlic fried rice is insanee
06/02/2025, 5:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes! Use the previous entry and round it off
06/02/2025, 5:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track it as cooked lentils, oil, and add 15% meat for this portion 

For instance, 100g of this Hakeem will have 15g meat
06/02/2025, 5:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: How much oil. It was 90g
06/02/2025, 6:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: 2-3tsp oil (10-15g)
13g beef/chicken
Cooked lentils
06/02/2025, 6:20 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Lol, I always enjoy my food. But today I was super busy and just needed something quick for energy in between. Hahaha, a burger for energy! 😂

Along with Project FOMO, try to read this book. It’s a very good read.
07/02/2025, 1:26 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it looks good! 
Based on the macros provided
07/02/2025, 1:29 am - Taha Ahmed: Tacos sound nice!
Or plates - smoked half chicken or wraps etc
Remember, you don't have to eat the whole thing if you feel like you'll over do your calories
You can take the leftover home and eat tomorrow
07/02/2025, 1:32 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Tacos make me feel great cuz you can have multiple so it feels like you’re having a lot of food 😂
07/02/2025, 1:33 am - Taha Ahmed: It presents some interesting ideas about food and metabolism, but I'd not pay much attention because the person who wrote it is a medical doctor/researcher with expertise outside of nutrition - so it's important to approach it with a critical eye. 

The book promotes whole, minimally processed foods, which is great, but some claims, like esp about specific foods 'boosting' fat-burning, can be a bit oversimplified and misleading. Nutrition and weight loss are more complex than just adding 'superfoods' to your diet (not really evidence-based!)
07/02/2025, 1:35 am - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Makes sense
07/02/2025, 1:43 am - PF - Asma Tariq: The same entry exists in MFP as well. :p

07/02/2025, 9:44 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Now how to log? I could do a quarter nandos chicken?
07/02/2025, 9:45 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): It was half chicken so if you had the leg/thigh part then log it as leg/thigh & if you had the breast part log that. Add 2tsp oil
07/02/2025, 9:53 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
I think that’s over not under right
07/02/2025, 9:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yeah looks fine
07/02/2025, 11:20 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
I just had two biscuits of Lemon sandwich (peak freans) with tea during a training session.
Just updating my MFP, Look 100 Calories for just two. 😂
07/02/2025, 11:23 am - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha. I am surprised it's got 1g of protein too
07/02/2025, 11:26 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Lol. Yes. I got the same entry in MFP as well.
07/02/2025, 1:53 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @923343773307 @60193244266 asalam o alikum weight update post ki thi check nai huvi ABI tak?
07/02/2025, 1:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: There's no pending post under your name- shayad post nahi huwa, aapko dubara post karna parega
07/02/2025, 4:18 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Jo Weight update ki BAAT ho rahi thi wohi comments mai post ki thi mai
07/02/2025, 5:16 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Ben Carpenter's Everything Fat Loss: The Definitive No Bullsh*t Guide, is a very good resource if you want to read up
07/02/2025, 5:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: One of the best.
07/02/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: He has a new book out, Fat Loss Habits, which he says is less dense, easier - I haven't read that yet, but I am sure it would be great
07/02/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah the first one focus on basics. This one talks more about the habits

Hi coaches, 
I'm extremely busy in Ghar mai shaddi and some project deadlines by today and I don't have time to count the calories of a farewell hi-tea I just had today.
Pls help me with the count. 

This plate had 
- A cup of soup
- Fish 
- Dynamite chicken
Drumstick (I didn't like the taste so I skipped it).
07/02/2025, 8:31 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
2 Gola kabab
A chicken boti
One tiny beef chapli kabab

Guide me in its calories pls.
07/02/2025, 8:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
3tsp Gajar Halwa,
1 Gulab Jaman ~ 120 calories may be
Khatai - small one.

Cake piece - I skipped. 

Help me in calories pls.
07/02/2025, 8:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d estimate around 1000-1100 with like 45-50g protein
07/02/2025, 8:46 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Should I divide 1100  calories in all dishes accordingly? Right.
07/02/2025, 8:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can just use 'quick add' and save yourself time and energy from tracking everything individually

it’s a one-time thing! <This message was edited>
07/02/2025, 8:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Let me do it now.
07/02/2025, 8:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How I will add "quick add". Guide me pls. 😂 My brain is just 🙊 <This message was edited>
07/02/2025, 8:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Two ways to go about it:

1. Track only calories (no macros) - Quick Add: 1100 calories
2. Track both calories & macros - Log 200g chicken breast (to track ~45-50g protein like Sameet said) and Quick Add the rest of the calories
07/02/2025, 8:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: VID-20250207-WA0028.mp4 (file attached)
Quick add calories ^
07/02/2025, 9:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Protein ~ 50.4g

Thank you so much. 😊
07/02/2025, 9:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Now quick add 800 calories and you're good! :)
07/02/2025, 9:05 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Already added. 🙂
07/02/2025, 9:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oh I just noticed! 😂
07/02/2025, 9:10 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
I had this too for lunch 😂
Broadway pizza, it was thin crust type.

Estimated calories pls.
07/02/2025, 9:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: What flavor and what size?
07/02/2025, 9:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also search protein and n the foods and add 50g

Then search carbs and fats and add them till the total is 1000-1100 <This message was edited>
07/02/2025, 9:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
20' xxl pizza slice and I guess this flavour.
07/02/2025, 9:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I added the protein as Taha guides 

Will search/add cards, fats too later.
07/02/2025, 9:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Assuming it's 1/8th of the pizza, estimated calories would be around ~550-750 kcal per slice
07/02/2025, 9:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Equal to about 3 large slices
07/02/2025, 9:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If large is around 12 inches
07/02/2025, 9:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t as me how I know this but…
07/02/2025, 9:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
07/02/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Area of a circle and all that 😂😂
07/02/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pizza Hut ka large is 14 inches so 2.2 slices. 

Which is around 650-800 depending on the flavor. 

Taha was close enough 😂🙏
07/02/2025, 9:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 😳
07/02/2025, 9:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Chalo aab jitna bhi piece tha.  
I will go with 650 cal. 😂
Bs aab is se zayda nahi add kerni. 😂 🙊 Hahaha.

Btw. Thanks for the quick guide guys!
07/02/2025, 10:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 650 would be more of a plain cheese pizza 😂
07/02/2025, 10:05 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Is the dominos large slice calories accurate on MFP?
07/02/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Mai ne aab ronay lag Jana hai. 😂

750 kcal. Done! 🫣
07/02/2025, 10:11 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Walk krna shuru krdein rote rote
07/02/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hahahahaha :p.
07/02/2025, 10:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I had saved 800 more calorie deficit than my target deficit till today for this week. Har din bacha bachay k. So no worries at all. 

I saved it for shaddi events. But program tou aaj hi vaar gaya. 😂
07/02/2025, 11:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the entry.
08/02/2025, 1:31 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: does protein powder curb hunger as well?
08/02/2025, 1:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: i am not getting enough protein inside and maybe I can supplement now
08/02/2025, 1:34 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: also which is the best online store to get it from?
08/02/2025, 2:49 am - Taha Ahmed: Yep, protein is pretty satiating, but drinking it isn’t quite the same as eating whole protein sources since they’re more filling. If you’re using a shake, try blending it with yogurt, oats, or fruit to make it more satisfying (bonus: more fiber too!)

For online stores, check out Jacked Nutrition, Protein Factory, Bravo Nutrition, or Swole Spartan.
08/02/2025, 3:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I wouldn’t trust Jacked personally. Rest are good. 

Also Alpha nutrition.
08/02/2025, 4:31 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: But would regular usage of supplementing it help my system notice fullness from it or  is it about volume
08/02/2025, 9:04 am - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Do ginger-turmeric shots, ginger lemon green tea, chia seed water, and detox water help with weight loss?????
08/02/2025, 9:10 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): they do nothing for actual fatloss or weightloss 
they might help with indigestion inflammation etc. uski wjah sy water weight waghera km hoskta hai but for actual weight they do absolutely nothing
08/02/2025, 9:12 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): liquid calories digest quick so just a scoop of whey protein without the things taha mentioned wont make you feel fuller for long
08/02/2025, 9:14 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yesterday someone was talking that she would start the day with a black coffee but slowly started feeling like it didnt suit her. Made her feel more anxious, hungry. Then a dietitian she worked with told her to start the day with some fats to balance her blood sugar. So she soaks some almonds and has those in the morning ?
08/02/2025, 9:15 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But a balanced breakfast would be equally beneficial no? With protein, fats, carbs and fiber
08/02/2025, 9:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): when you wakeup in the morning then blood sugar levels already balanced hoty hain mostly high nhi hoty & black coffee sy sugar levels oy effect hota nhi so fats add kr k spike km krny ka to point bnta nhi i'm not sure kon c logic sy fats sugar balance krny ka bola jb black coffee e ly rhi thee wo 
and yes a balanced breakfast is always better adequate amount of all the macros
08/02/2025, 9:26 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Ok because someone else also said have desi ghee first thing to manage blood sugar. All totka’s from my gym friends 😄
08/02/2025, 9:32 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you have a meal which has only carbs & lacks fiber protein fats then sugar spike zada hogi but if you make it a complete meal by adding some fiber protein n fats to wo spike supress hojaegi but jb kuch khaya e nhi sugar spike hui e nhi to usko manage q krna hai
08/02/2025, 11:06 am - Taha Ahmed: It’s mostly about volume, but there’s also a bit of adaptation involved. Your body recognizes fullness through both stomach stretch (volume) and nutrient signals (protein, fat, fiber, etc.)

Liquid calories, like protein shakes, don’t trigger satiety the same way solid food does because they pass through your stomach faster. That’s why blending them with fiber-rich or thicker foods (like oats, yogurt, or banana) can help

Over time, you might get used to feeling some satiety from protein shakes, but for real fullness, solid protein sources will always do a better job
08/02/2025, 11:08 am - Taha Ahmed: That's Rashi chowdhary and her fat first sciaanceee! Not the actual science
08/02/2025, 11:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Iska naam sun kay ghussa aajata hai
08/02/2025, 11:11 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): meny to isky content ko "not interested" kr k filter kia hua hai insta py
08/02/2025, 11:12 am - Taha Ahmed: Caffeine is a stimulant, so anxiety could surface for a few reasons. Like black coffee on an empty stomach can spike cortisol, which might lead to jitteriness and increased hunger for some people. It's also a diuretic, that means it makes you pee more and more thirsty, so some people end up mistaking thirst for hunger. 

Adding some fats (like almonds) could help slow down the absorption of caffeine and stabilize blood sugar, but it’s not the only solution. Adding milk can help with it as well! But like Ali mentioned above, your blood sugar is already stabilized in the morning, unless you're diabetic or have some other health concerns. Most people don't need to worry about that! :)

I used to love having black coffee but overtime my stomach started rejecting it and I'd get severe heartburn. Just adding 50-70ml milk per cup made the biggest difference! :) <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 11:13 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve blocked her 3 years ago
08/02/2025, 11:13 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus caffeine doesn’t suit people with anxiety at times.
08/02/2025, 11:15 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, if you're already anxious, it's only going to trigger the symptoms further. I've dealt with that too lol
08/02/2025, 11:16 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: If it spikes cortisol why does EVERYONE in the gym have black coffee first thing. I know its supposed to help with workouts but you could have a banana instead ? (Like i do)
08/02/2025, 11:16 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Ladies especially
08/02/2025, 11:18 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, caffeine spikes cortisol, but that’s not always a bad thing?? -- Cortisol naturally rises in the morning anyway, and for workouts, that temporary boost can actually help with energy and performance. That’s why a lot of people have black coffee before training! It enhances your focus!

But if caffeine makes you jittery or messes with your appetite, a banana (or any quick carb) is a great alternative for workout fuel! You don't have to drink coffee, just because others are drinking it. It’s really about what works best for your body. If the banana works for you, stick with it! 
Or maybe a few dates.
Or maybe a proper breakfast with bread, eggs, sausages, and chai.
🤷🏽‍♂
08/02/2025, 11:19 am - Taha Ahmed: Chronic high cortisol levels are bad - being stressed 24/7 that your nervous system never regulates and stays in the fight-or-flight mode... now that's TERRIBLE! <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 11:20 am - Taha Ahmed: Your pre-workout fuel should match your energy needs and what makes you feel good! No one’s handing out medals for drinking black coffee at 8 am. 😂 Do what works for you.
08/02/2025, 11:20 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: You’d think they were !!
08/02/2025, 11:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Which reminds me. Time to make coffee.
08/02/2025, 11:21 am - Taha Ahmed: I just made a second cup of coffee
08/02/2025, 11:21 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: And ofcourse it has no calories compared to the little banana
08/02/2025, 11:24 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes! But coffee itself doesn’t give you energy since it has no calories- it just makes you feel more alert and focused, which helps in training. Caffeine can increase fat mobilization, meaning it makes fat available for energy, but whether your body actually uses that fat depends on a lot of factors. The effects are real but pretty tiny in the grand scheme of things!
08/02/2025, 11:24 am - Taha Ahmed: Should I add ghee in it to stabilize my sugar levels? 😂

P.S. Been there, done that back in 2016-2017-  even served butter-loaded coffee to a date once. @923002040986  still cracks up at this info! <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 11:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): since i have started working out ma empty stomach workouts krta raha hun except for past probably 6-8 months 
never took coffee or pre workout or even a date/banana successfully doing progressive overload kbhi energy down nhi feel hui so this varies from person to person k coffee/pre workout/meal lena hai ya nhi
08/02/2025, 11:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 2tbsp😄 <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 11:51 am - PF - Nida Umer: I was giving a laugh react even before i read my name😂
08/02/2025, 11:54 am - PF - Nida Umer: Ngl even i have tried bulletproof coffee
08/02/2025, 11:54 am - PF - Nida Umer: Tried keto a few years ago and fainted on day 3 😂😂😂 <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 11:57 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Did she bring her own food on the next date then?
08/02/2025, 11:58 am - Taha Ahmed: I should've mentioned she's an ex now! 🙃🥲
It's all Rashi's fault!
08/02/2025, 12:00 pm - PF - Nida Umer: She ran away
He only tells half the story
08/02/2025, 12:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): A better question would be i guess was there a next date even 😂
08/02/2025, 12:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: @923343773307 u brought this upon urself
08/02/2025, 12:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: We dated for 3 and a half years, and then she brought up my bulletproof coffee and ended things :(
08/02/2025, 12:02 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol, I don't blame her.
 I once subscribed to this low calori food service for a month and told her specifically I don't want keto and high fat stuff. Took over 70k for a month and started sending 2 huge mugs of bullet-proof coffee along with 3 tiny meals, which were mostly veggies, saying that was '5 meals'.
08/02/2025, 12:04 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: A cousin lives by that coffee, came to stay at ours, i had no ghee, so she put 2 tablespoons of nurpur salted butter in her coffee and had that for the whole week.
08/02/2025, 12:06 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I wonder how come people drink that zehr type taste wali coffee. ulti kesy nhi aati
08/02/2025, 12:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: I've tried desi ghee, all kinds of butter, MCTs, coconut oil, olive oil. And I must say, they're all fucking disgusting!
08/02/2025, 12:09 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: God!
I am on thw autism spectrum, so tons of food related sensory issues. I can't even look at people drinking that, let alone try it.
08/02/2025, 12:09 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol waisay I can't even look at fruitchat. Ramzan is true aazmaish for me.
08/02/2025, 12:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: She jumped out of the window. 

I don’t even blame her.
08/02/2025, 12:33 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 😂😂😂😂
08/02/2025, 12:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is how serial killers are born
08/02/2025, 12:45 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Are any of these myths true? Because I am doing all of them almost

Myth 1: Oil pulling on an empty stomach in the morning detoxifies ur body and removes toxins from the blood

Myth 2: Ginger, amla, orange, and lemon shots boost immunity

Myth 3: Drinking overnight soaked chia seeds with lemon (1 tbsp) in the morning helps with weight loss

Myth 4: Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of water before every meal controls hunger

Myth 5: Drinking ginger lemon tea in the morning or evening after meals helps with weight loss

Myth 6: Drinking more water (3 to 4 liters) helps in weight loss

Myth 7: Even if detox water doesn’t aid in weight loss, it improves skin and boosts immunity.

Chtgpt n youtube talk a lot about the benefits of these
08/02/2025, 12:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1. No
2. Yes, to some extent
3. No
4. Yes, because you fill up your tummy with water so hunger goes down a bit in the moment, but you might want more food later (more energy/calories)
5. No
6. Yes and no. Water keeps you feeling full so you end up eating less (induces a big calorie deficit)
7. Kind of! But not always true (or long-term) because you need a lot of nutrients for a healthy skin and immunity
08/02/2025, 12:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, ChatGPT is a great resource but it sucks for health and fitness. 

It basically uses the information available on the internet to form an opinion and present that to you. 

Unfortunately the database itself pulling from is loaded with misinformation and so I wouldn’t recommend using it for such questions.
08/02/2025, 12:58 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Ginger turmeric ones are great for immunity - fresh ginger shots (made at home) single handedly fixed my low immunity problem (I was on antibiotics every month for 6 months before I did it) I can go on and on about how beneficial it is!! But yes idk that it helps weightloss - I def didn’t do it for that reason and didn’t lose any weight when I did it (I toon them every day for 3 months) but the other benefits are amazing! I recommend it to anyone who needs an immunity boost (just don’t over do it in the summer)
08/02/2025, 12:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Also when using ChatGPT you have to be really very specific if you want a correct answer if you will ask some open ended questions it will answer that way 
Internet has both right n wrong info but if you want to extract the right info you need to know how to do that
08/02/2025, 1:01 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Coconut oil is however great for reducing inflammation markers - IF those are high for you and if you have pcos or other autoimmune conditions (I have hashimotos) - I could never bring myself to eat spoonfuls of it but I cook primarily in coconut or avocado oil or desi ghee
08/02/2025, 1:02 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Ya’ll are making me want to go watch this persons content now
08/02/2025, 1:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): she was someone taha was dating😄

08/02/2025, 1:20 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Cant find the chat where we discussed about gol gappay

08/02/2025, 1:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 60ish in each without the filling if i remember correctly 
@60193244266 esa e tha na

08/02/2025, 1:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
Also how to est this🙈
08/02/2025, 1:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Rice was added to the equation 
But i didnt complete everything
08/02/2025, 1:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Can i round it to 1000 cals?
08/02/2025, 1:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you didnt complete everything then 700ish i would estimate
08/02/2025, 1:43 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thanx
08/02/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I love ginger shots. I didn't know about them till I went to Neatherland and saw them on the menu for 4 Euros. Assumed it was some fancy drink and was kinda shocked when it turned out to be plain ginger. For me, they have worked well, fewer allergic reactions, and can deal with viruses coming from school without having a full fledged viral infection.
08/02/2025, 2:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do you guys know why this happens waisay?
08/02/2025, 2:28 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Why it helps or why white people repackage all the good stuff from south asian lore and ayurveda and sell it for $$$$ 😂
08/02/2025, 2:30 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>

08/02/2025, 2:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why it works
08/02/2025, 2:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ayurveda and good stuff in a sentence is a trigger for me 🤣🤣🤣
08/02/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Omg noooo talk to meeeee
08/02/2025, 2:38 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: We should prolly switch to the core group before we get into this lol
08/02/2025, 2:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So ginger HAS a PLETHORA of research behind it with its anti inflammatory properties and effects on health. 

But why most people see a benefit with things like ginger shots is because our diet is horrible. 

Most people aren’t getting the adequate nutrient like protein, fiber, vitamins and mineral and so these shots and detoxes help add those nutrients into their diet and that has benefits.
08/02/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol I like ginger, so shots make me happy and happy hormones kick allergies.
08/02/2025, 2:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hhahahahaha if you follow a desi diet, you’re literally have ginger in each meal.
08/02/2025, 2:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: White folks don’t (seasoning ka unko pata kahan hai) and so they obsess over it.
08/02/2025, 2:47 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol, if you don't enjoy it like this, adding this in sparkling water, with lemon and a sweetener of your choice, will help.
08/02/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Yeah. Dishoom, the famous parsi restaurant in London, published their recipes last year and their chicken tikka has 30 gm ginger in 250 gm chicken.
08/02/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: The most gingery tikka ever but absolutely delicious
08/02/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I hate it this way lol but I took a shot of this like this everyday for over 3 months and it changed my life! The video is from a 2023. I needed a big dose for what I was going through but since then I haven’t had to ever repeat it. Now I just buy the white poeple ginger shots from the grocery store every now and then
08/02/2025, 2:50 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: (This is not medical advice - what worked for me may not work for you - zyada tabiyat kharab honay ki soorat mai doctor se ruju farmayen)

Breakfast 
Should i add anything else to this?
08/02/2025, 3:36 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: <Media omitted>
40 g chapati
115 g salad 
3 tbsp rice 
Fine?
08/02/2025, 3:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: All of this is breakfast or are these two meals?
08/02/2025, 3:46 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Breakfast n lunch
08/02/2025, 3:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Some improvements: 

1. Try to gradually add more protein to these meals. 
2. Meal size can be bigger, these won’t fill you up for longer and might not provide adequate energy.
08/02/2025, 4:37 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
Are these actually this low in calories
08/02/2025, 5:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What are these? Kidney beans?
08/02/2025, 6:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: No the green French beans
08/02/2025, 6:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: how would you make a filling protein shake with greek yogurt? if I u just use greek yogurt + protein powder, itw ould be too thick
08/02/2025, 7:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah for that it’s fine.
08/02/2025, 7:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It would be. Thick usually means more filling. You can add water if it’s too thick. 

If you just mix protein powder and Greek yoghurt then it’s more of a pudding then shake.

Which is better
09/02/2025, 2:10 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 100% 
its a good whey
09/02/2025, 2:11 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: First time seeing this one so no idea
09/02/2025, 2:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): muscle blaze is an indian brand i think
09/02/2025, 2:17 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It tastes good. I had firstly started to have whey protein with this brand. Initially I felt a bit nauseated and bloated after having it because it was my very first time with any whey protein but gradually my body adjusted with it and the taste developed as well.  Now I'm okay to have it at any time.
09/02/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: I read that on chatGPT this can happen in the beginning
09/02/2025, 2:30 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Whey isolate more processed  i have never taken it so i hv no idea
09/02/2025, 2:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I have it now, not whey isolate as pic you shared above but Rule 1 isolate and I think it's a more refined one. Rest coaches will guide. <This message was edited>
09/02/2025, 2:33 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): whey isolate or hydrolyzed is an option for those who have lactose intolerance else you should be fine with normal whey concenterate
09/02/2025, 2:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bloating or nausea doesnt happen to everyone 
you might felt nausea as you were not used to the taste n it triggered nausea
09/02/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>

09/02/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Cookies and cream is pretty sweet. Some people run just from hearing the flavor name when I tell them 😂
09/02/2025, 2:46 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: That's why I asked you about it.
09/02/2025, 2:46 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I found it munasib
09/02/2025, 2:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I havnt used Dyamtize ka cookies and cream but MyProtein ka use kia hua hai n its quite balanced
09/02/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Bro I was trying to decide between this and ON and Dymatize was the better ROI option. And then I had your recommendation as well so I just clicked buy 😂
09/02/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: That's nice. Then it is a must try.
09/02/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: They have many other flavors including dunkin donut flavors
09/02/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I got this tub for a very decent price compared to all the online prices I was getting

How can i track calories of this chocolate 
It has different flavours bite sized chocolates 
And doesn’t have any barcode..
10/02/2025, 2:26 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: You can find this information in the nutrition facts section on the box..
10/02/2025, 2:28 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: This  is usually on the back or side of the box.
10/02/2025, 2:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
10/02/2025, 2:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Cadbury Milk Tray - they're usually around 15-20g each / 77-103 kcal, so just weigh a few and then you can track them

They're also similar to butler's chocolate bites <This message was edited>

Reminder: you don't have to be in a deficit everyday to lose weight 

Fat loss happens over time, not in a single day. One day of slight surplus won’t undo your progress- your overall trend matters more. Just get back to your plan tomorrow 😊

Cals
10/02/2025, 9:30 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thanks for sharing. I would like to offer a suggestion. If you have seen @60193244266 recipes videos, you could ideally reduce the oil quantity and take advantage of the water from the tomatoes (maybe add some more if required), put a lid on and let the steam aid in the cooking process. Might help you reduce calories per 100g serving
10/02/2025, 9:31 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I love bhindi too and my mom makes it dry with very less oil. But I'll make it myself next time and share with you all (calorie count included)

16/02/2025, 1:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): track it as 185g indian roti 
2.5-3tbsp oil
20g yogurt (raita)
16/02/2025, 1:20 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Why the carbs always goea up like anything... half day and the target for catb is almost fonished
16/02/2025, 1:22 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): because you are just eating carbs 
divide your carbs intake throughout the day & meals
in each meal add 20-30g of protein
16/02/2025, 1:24 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 185g because of two rotis?
16/02/2025, 1:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): because you yourself mentioned the cooked weight in your message
16/02/2025, 3:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s 185g of roti. Not 185g of carbs.
16/02/2025, 3:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah you can use this or you can always create your own entry
16/02/2025, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
You can also track these entries like this
16/02/2025, 3:34 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Is dissolving protein powder in latte milk easy? Did anyone try it before?
16/02/2025, 3:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It doesn’t dissolve it hot water or milk
16/02/2025, 3:37 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Ohh, so it will clump at the bottom
16/02/2025, 3:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: so before frothing the milk, I can add the protein powder in cold milk, mix it and then froth it

Sabroso Chicken cheese Paratha (frozen)  calories and macros. 

The same as given in the nutrition label of the Partha box. 

If you have pratha cravings, this can be a good option.
16/02/2025, 3:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes but remember these calories are when u dont use additional oil for cooking which you dont have to use as its like semi cooked & it takes hardly 2 minutes to prep it 
Do account for any additional oil used
16/02/2025, 4:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes, 💯
I use only 5-6g desi ghee (45-55) in prep.
16/02/2025, 4:25 pm - PF - Sajal: App name

17/02/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just track it as a normal cooked/boiled pasta
17/02/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: It’s cheese filled..or should i log it as 5% more?
17/02/2025, 12:05 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): log for a slice of cheese 60-70 calories
17/02/2025, 12:05 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: But dry and boiled is not much difference?
17/02/2025, 12:10 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you measure dry lets say 100g then boiled weight maybe 200-225ish grams hoga ya around that so obviously accordingly calories ma difference hoga if you measure raw or boiled

17/02/2025, 12:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s your protein target? I doubt any of us gave you a target of 166g
17/02/2025, 12:41 am - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: <Media omitted>
For some reason I couldn’t set 153gms in app hence kept it higher so at least I can aim closer

17/02/2025, 4:15 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: I tried dymatize iso 100 cookies n cream and it's really good
17/02/2025, 4:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I have tried these 2 personally n they are good
17/02/2025, 5:02 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: Also, is whoop worth buying?
17/02/2025, 5:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on what you’re looking to get out of it
17/02/2025, 5:08 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: so the current goal is to loose weight, track & maintain good lifestyle
17/02/2025, 5:20 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery joined from the community
17/02/2025, 5:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Whoop helps track various lifestyle factors like sleep, stress, performance intensity, and others such as HRT, SPO2, steps, etc.

If you know how to use the data to optimize your life and health- like your training, nutrition, etc.- then it's great

But if not, it may take a while to learn and implement what the data is suggesting, and so many numbers can be overwhelming to track, and optimize
17/02/2025, 5:57 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: Thank you
17/02/2025, 6:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Its also expensive and you can get cheaper options like Fitbit that track your steps and sleep just as well

Is it fine if i skip dinner at this point…? i had my meals late than usual today and i don’t feel like eating now..
17/02/2025, 11:22 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: If u dnt do strength training.. is 100g of protein still necessary?? Or if you do intense workouts you need more protein?
If my weight becomes 54-55 kg tab bhi 100g of protein hoga?
17/02/2025, 11:25 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Sometimes protein intake 110g or 115g  hojata hai or sometimes 92g is it ok?
17/02/2025, 11:27 pm - PF - Senora Adaa / Ahlaam Khan joined from the community
17/02/2025, 11:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. One day doesn’t make a difference.
17/02/2025, 11:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Protein isn’t because of working out. Protein is essential for health. 

It’s important for basics like recovery, immunity, hair, skin, red blood cells and so many other processes. 

If you’re not interested in building muscle or retaining muscle (losing muscle means you’re damaging health long term especially as you age)

Then you can reduce it by 10-20g.
17/02/2025, 11:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 90-110g is fine. You don’t need to be at 100g dot everyday.
17/02/2025, 11:31 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: If i do more intense workouts to protein intake bhi barh jaega?
17/02/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Is it okay to take multivitamins like biotin and vitamin e with a balanced diet?
17/02/2025, 11:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. This should still work
17/02/2025, 11:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes

I just wanted to share how I've been managing to hit my macros while in a deficit, even with a lot going on. So much variety of food in the log. 

I've already planned my dinner, and for lunch, I also had a cucumber, a radish, and few lettuce which I usually don't track.

This is what I can manage with an 8 hour working day. ✨ 😊

18/02/2025, 7:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just great👌
18/02/2025, 7:02 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Curious 
Why are you tracking supplements and sucral?
18/02/2025, 7:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: I track it mainly to keep a record of everything I’ve consumed. You don’t have to since it has no calories, but I do it because of my IBS. Sometimes, even the tiniest things can trigger it, so having a log helps me look back and analyze my intake
18/02/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I don't take supplements regularly. I always take gaps in it. It helps me in tracking the doses. The same goes for Sucral. 

I also take gaps in whey protein as well.

I’ve been struggling to meet my daily protein intake, and I was thinking about incorporating a protein shake into my diet. However, I’m a bit concerned that it might lead to weight gain instead of helping me lose weight. Could you guide me on the right way and quantity to use protein powder so that it aligns with my fitness goals? Also, do you think it’s a good option for me to complete my protein intake, and if so, which brands are recommended?
19/02/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The only wait it can lead to weight gain is if it increases your calories. 

Otherwise no food can lead to weight gain if calories are in check. 

Protein powders can help increase protein intake and only carry about 100-150 calories.
19/02/2025, 2:54 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Rule 1,Dymatize, ON, Myprotein

20/02/2025, 12:26 am - Taha Ahmed: Hmm, well, Facebook is where we provide in-depth coaching and share all the actual resources, so having an account will be essential for accessing the content

I totally get that some people prefer to stay off Facebook, but even if you create an account just for this, you’ll gain access to valuable discussions, guides, and support from the community (through check-ins, your personal posts, etc.). You don’t have to be active elsewhere- just use it as a learning tool! 🤷🏽‍♂

Think you'd be down for that?

So from last 2days I couldn’t get time for walk and workout 
Am very punctual for walk but am not well enough 
The thing is now I felt am gaining weight again 
Jo 3months sai mehnat ki thee I guess 2days puri ho gai hai 
Although am not eating too much but still feel like gained weight 
My question is kya 2days mai weight gain hota hai ?
20/02/2025, 1:28 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Nope. It might be water retention or bloating. 

If you are in deficit then nope. 😕
20/02/2025, 1:28 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Weight gain and weight loss mein same time lagta hai
20/02/2025, 1:29 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: You need 3500 calories to gain 1 pound of weight

20/02/2025, 1:30 am - PF - Nida Jamshaid: Although am feeling weak from inside but still feeling gained

Had this delicious chat for lunch at work.

Total Protein ~ 18g 🤩

Left over Raat ka salan of Lobia
Available veggies in the fridge
20/02/2025, 3:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
20/02/2025, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I also add Greek yoghurt when making chaat. Even more protein.
20/02/2025, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Greek yoghurt and lemon 🍋
20/02/2025, 3:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Avoiding yoghurt and lemon due to sore throat and flu. 😣
20/02/2025, 4:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhhh
20/02/2025, 4:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Isopure vanilla protein powder did mix but can’t do a full scoop
20/02/2025, 4:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Only did like 10g
20/02/2025, 4:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: In hot latte
20/02/2025, 6:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Told you it won’t mix in hot latte.
20/02/2025, 6:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You need to mix in in regular water or milk and then add it to the coffee.
20/02/2025, 6:39 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I mixed it in cold milk first and then frothed that milk.
20/02/2025, 6:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So then what happened?
20/02/2025, 6:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did it not mix in the cold milk?
20/02/2025, 6:54 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: <Media omitted>
Please advise if it’s correct?
20/02/2025, 7:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope.
20/02/2025, 7:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search cooked lentils.
20/02/2025, 7:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And add oil or butter separately.
20/02/2025, 7:02 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: Ok

Colder rainy weather demands some desi dessert. Lols.

It's Gurr wali seviyan (Vermicelli), these are almost 10tsp. 

10tsp should be 50g. Any guide pls. 

Very moderate to light ghee and sweet. Any guess estimation for Calories?
20/02/2025, 7:40 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Kal he bni humare ghr 😋
20/02/2025, 7:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Malaysia main cold weather hi nahin hota 🤣
20/02/2025, 7:43 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Idher tou raat se barish and cold. Thank GOD k thori si thand wapis i hai 😂 <This message was edited>
20/02/2025, 7:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How many calories pls? 😂
20/02/2025, 7:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: @923441183411 what say
20/02/2025, 7:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 200-225ish
20/02/2025, 7:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Chalo. 😂
Almost 10tsp for 225 cal 😂
Hum desi logo ka kia banay ga 😂
20/02/2025, 7:56 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ghee 1tbsp to hoga e 140ish calories to usi ki lga lain aap
20/02/2025, 7:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Not really 1tbsp, it was less than. But I will go with 225 cal.
20/02/2025, 7:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): still km b krlo aap to 175ish kidr ni gaen
20/02/2025, 8:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Wahi na. I checked Vermicelli. 

And I'm wondering that, in our desi homes, a light dessert or bemar Ka typical sa khana has so many calories and carbs/fats, very poor nutrition values. I thought so 🤷🏻‍♀️ <This message was edited>
20/02/2025, 10:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Actually lemon can help soothe a sore throat due to its vitC and antibacterial properties - unless you're drinking it raw, which might be too harsh. It’s not bad for most people, but if it really irritates your throat, you can skip it!
20/02/2025, 11:04 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Lemon doesn't suit me in any form in recent times. It triggers a hormone imbalance in me. 
Im taking other Vit. C sources. 😊
20/02/2025, 11:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Interesting. Would you like to tell me more about the trigger and what exactly happens when you have it?
20/02/2025, 11:19 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It triggered my PCOS lately which were pretty managed at that time. I had a diet plan from a renewed someone lols - lemons were used in so many salads and meals which they gave me. Water Mai add Ker k piyen. 

I was pretty much normal on my hormones. But with that plan, it triggered again, I kept asking them k yeh mujhy suit nhe Ker raha and my cycle is delaying Jo k itnay years mai nhe huwa but they were like Kuch Nahi hota. Yeh and Woh supplement laen and all. And that plan was under 1300-1400 cal a day and yeh cal mai aab calculate ki Hain. Woh bs plan send kertay thy and oper nechay kuch nahi, kitni calories hai no macroes. And zero learning.

Well, after one and a half months, I said sorry to them. I was on the inositol again, and I struggled again to make it normal on my own. 

I was having the same meals except lemon and they didn't bother me later. 

So I think, whenever I use lemon, it affects me in a bad way.m, same goes to vinegar. 🤷🏻‍♀️ <This message was edited>
20/02/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: And before going for that plan, they had asked for complete scanning. And all of my reports were normal except a bit of high cholesterol, very low.
21/02/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is this fine?
21/02/2025, 2:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No. It’ll just be carbs. Fat nahin hoga.
21/02/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: 80grams bindi ke liye kya log kro
21/02/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
21/02/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And oil separately
21/02/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
21/02/2025, 3:30 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: I have a question, why is it not accurate on the apps ??
and does that mean we have to check here for all that we are tracking???
21/02/2025, 3:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the entries you select. 

Anybody can create entries on MyFitnessPal and so some of them are wrong too. 

This is why I prefer MacrosFirst. Less such entries there.
21/02/2025, 6:20 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @60193244266 100g capsicum 90g carrot 50g   zucchini 205g noodles 1 tablespoon oil 2 tablespoon soya sauce calories Kitni hogi?

Can’t believe my eyes as I managed this much protein before lunch only!!!🥳
21/02/2025, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s amazing.
21/02/2025, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh sub MyFitnessPal main alag alag add karain na. 

205g cooked noodles hain ya uncooked?
21/02/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): What you had

21/02/2025, 6:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll probably be close to 400
21/02/2025, 6:35 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How to manage protein intake under COVID? Not taking whey because I'm not feeling like it. Plus I have to be on maintenance calories I guess, so much weakness. 

Any suggestions coaches?
21/02/2025, 6:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When I got Covid, I used to rely lots of whey and making milkshakes and smoothies cause didn’t feel like chewing
21/02/2025, 6:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I don't even feel like shakes or liquids. Only warm stuff.
21/02/2025, 6:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but I had it as medicine because protein will help with recovery and weakness plus it was easier to get to maintenance calories through liquids
21/02/2025, 6:38 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Eggs omelette (3 eggs with spinach and tomatoes), strawberries shake with whey protein ( I made this with Greek yogurt)
21/02/2025, 6:42 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Is it fine to have whey in flu? I mean I have doubts that it might have bad effects, the same people say about milk.

Flu Mai milk na lo.
21/02/2025, 6:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I am allergic to pollen and dust so if I stopped having whey when I have flu, I would never be able to have whey or milk.
21/02/2025, 6:53 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Kahny may Ji spices use hoty hay or ginger etc iski calories count krni hoti hay ya nai?
21/02/2025, 6:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Same here, allergic to dust. Pollen rarely, well got your point. ✨
I never stopped having milk in it. Even I was taking whey till yesterday. Just had a doubt bout whet. 

Thanks for enlightening this to me. 😊🙏
21/02/2025, 7:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. It’s 10-20 calories at best.

21/02/2025, 8:18 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Cooked 350g spaghetti 50g chicken <This message was edited>
21/02/2025, 8:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll have to track those things separately.
21/02/2025, 8:19 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Sirf spaghetti ko kese track kare
21/02/2025, 8:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 350g cooked spaghetti is 550 calories

21/02/2025, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes
21/02/2025, 10:19 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: For mutton/lamb broth.
If I know the weight of meat (raw or cooked), then I should add only it. Guide pls?
21/02/2025, 10:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): broth ma to meat nhi hoga na that will be liquid
21/02/2025, 10:21 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes
21/02/2025, 10:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): so us k leay just take a broth entry

21/02/2025, 10:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Share a picture of what you’re having if possible, easier to guide you

21/02/2025, 10:40 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: How do you track biryani? Rice and meat separately?

How should i track this lettuce wrap smash beef ‘burger’
21/02/2025, 11:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track the beef patty (around ~120g), sauces, oil and cheese (looks like it's got a slice)
21/02/2025, 11:31 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Yes 1 slice
21/02/2025, 11:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can search for quarter pounder without bun.
21/02/2025, 11:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Is there such an entry?
21/02/2025, 11:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah yeah
21/02/2025, 11:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
21/02/2025, 11:58 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Perfect thanks!!!
22/02/2025, 12:04 am - Taha Ahmed: Crazy- I didn't know this existed 🤭
Probably cause I've never had a burger without a bun 🤷🏽‍♂ lol!
22/02/2025, 12:05 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: How was the burger ?
22/02/2025, 12:06 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ghareeb k sir se chatt or neeche ki zameen dono nahi

It's a 350ml yakhni (broth).
30g meat (mutton), I removed the bones before weighing. 

How many calories and how to track?
22/02/2025, 2:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Beef / lamb broth 350g

30g cooked lamb
22/02/2025, 2:29 am - PF - Asma Tariq: There is no green tick entry of lamb/mutton broth in MFP?

Can I use beef broth? It's available with a green tick.
22/02/2025, 2:39 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Is it accurate? 😳
22/02/2025, 4:46 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
Eating out today what should I get from the bbq options and how to track
22/02/2025, 4:50 am - PF - Rabia Bhimani: Umm get chicken Tawook
22/02/2025, 5:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
22/02/2025, 5:20 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: But look at those kababs 😭☠️
22/02/2025, 5:21 am - PF - Rabia Bhimani: But sometimes those kababs are so dry
22/02/2025, 5:21 am - PF - Rabia Bhimani: I only like it if I’m dining in
22/02/2025, 5:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: All of those are fantastic protein options but yes, the chicken will be lowest in calories
22/02/2025, 5:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or get a mix 🤘🏼
22/02/2025, 10:11 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
22/02/2025, 10:11 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
22/02/2025, 10:11 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
22/02/2025, 10:11 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I got the mix - ate the whole small chicken on tabouli bowl - all the salad in the big plate - almost all the hummus - half the rice and meat
22/02/2025, 10:13 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Tracked it like this - does this look ok? The beef kabab log is of a packaged beef kabab that I buy from the store and the log is a scanned version and the size of one of those is about half of this one so I think that’s good - the chicken I think is off - should I add oil?
22/02/2025, 10:13 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: The gyro I think I’m overestimating?
22/02/2025, 10:14 am - Taha Ahmed: What did it look like?
22/02/2025, 10:15 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: The shredded meat in this
22/02/2025, 10:18 am - Taha Ahmed: I think the estimated calories are fine- it's got a nice amount of oil in it
22/02/2025, 10:19 am - Taha Ahmed: And yes, for packaged beef kebab, you'll have to add oil separately
22/02/2025, 10:20 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
No no the beef log already accounts for that it’s the entry for this item - when you heat these there’s a bunch of oil coming out of them and all
22/02/2025, 10:21 am - Taha Ahmed: Can you show it's nutritional label?
22/02/2025, 10:21 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: The dessert put me over the daily calories anyway - what’s another spoon of oil gonna do 😂
22/02/2025, 10:22 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
22/02/2025, 10:33 am - Taha Ahmed: How much over did you go today?
And one tsp of oil is 45 kcal only
22/02/2025, 10:41 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: 400 calories and I was already 200 calories over during the week - and there’s a dawat at home tomorrow but I’ll controlllll (but there’s makhni chicken and nihari) I guess I could starve on Sunday 😭☠️😂 JK
22/02/2025, 10:41 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Added the oil
22/02/2025, 10:44 am - Taha Ahmed: And what's your daily calorie target you're aiming for? 
I'm just trying to understand something <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 10:46 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
This but the app is set up so that weekdays I limit to 1300ish and weekends I have up to 1600ish
22/02/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: But realistically I’ve averaged 1550-1650 daily cals
22/02/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I’m always over the app cals
22/02/2025, 10:54 am - Taha Ahmed: I remember suggesting something like 1750-1950 (your initial post on FB) - that’s your calorie deficit range. Your maintenance is higher, somewhere around 2400-2600 kcal.

So even if you’re averaging 1950 per day, you’re still in a deficit- which means no, you don’t need to "starve" on Sunday, haha! 😆 You may lose weight a little slower, but it's still progress, nonetheless. Wdyt?

I wanted to share this because I see you stressing over small fluctuations when you’re actually on track. The body doesn’t reset at midnight- it's about your overall intake across the week, not one "oops" day. So instead of thinking about skipping, how about you just adjust a little? Maybe go lighter earlier in the day, add some movement, and enjoy your dawat guilt-free (yes, even the makhni chicken & nihari ☺️)
22/02/2025, 10:55 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: You’re right! Thank you for the reminder 🤍 I’m being harder on myself because I’m not moving enough yet! I keep saying this is the week and then the whole week’s gone and I haven’t moved at all! <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 11:00 am - Taha Ahmed: I’m in the same boat as you- I’ve got a million things to do: planning, strategizing, packing, shopping (and then actual work stuff)… I’m literally moving to Lahore tomorrow. I keep telling myself I’ll work out, but realistically, I know it’s just a fake promise I’m making to myself. Once I’m settled, then I can!

But for now? Even bare minimum movement counts. Steps here and there, some squats and pushups by my work desk- it’s still something, isn't it?. The real flex isn’t going all in every day - it’s doing what you can, even when you can’t do the big stuff. That’s what consistency actually looks like <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 11:00 am - Taha Ahmed: One thing I've stopped doing is being unnecessarily hard on myself. If you need tips, I'd be more than happy to talk about it :)
22/02/2025, 11:00 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes please !
22/02/2025, 11:01 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: This year i said i will do slow and steady in everything, no getting caught up in the rush. But then if i’m not hard on myself I end up becoming tooooooo easyyyyyy !
22/02/2025, 11:02 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Between last year (the start of this journey from my highest ever weight) to actually just today I have lost 25lbs! Only 5 of that is from this year but still! It’s a milestone!
22/02/2025, 11:02 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: It really is the slow and steady that matters
22/02/2025, 11:03 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

There's a fine line in between, and we need to stop seeing everything as just black or white. *Life exists in the in-between.* There’s a whole spectrum of grey, and that’s where the real work happens- finding our balance, our sweet spot. Not what works for someone else, but what works for us.

(Also, yes, I did add a palette of black, white, and 50 shades of grey… but don’t get any ideas. This is strictly a design choice‼ 😏)
22/02/2025, 11:13 am - Taha Ahmed: > Between last year (the start of this journey from my highest ever weight) to actually just today I have lost 25lbs! Only 5 of that is from this year but still! It’s a milestone!

@15125082761  But honestly, this time around, you’re not just losing weight - you’re gaining so much more, no? You’re building a healthier body from the inside out, improving your energy and overall health markers. You’re developing a mindset where food isn’t the enemy but something you understand and enjoy without guilt. You’ll have a much clearer grasp of nutrition, make more informed choices effortlessly, and break free from the all-or-nothing cycle. This isn’t just about numbers anymore - it’s about feeling strong, confident, and in control of your health for the long run. And that’s the REAL WIN! <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 11:30 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Thats’s been for sure the journey I’ve been on since last year - I think that’s 100% why I didn’t gain back those original 20lbs - because I decided to stop punishing myself and hating myself
22/02/2025, 11:32 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: The sweater I wore today - I’ve had it for 10ish years - I would never wear it because I thought it would look nicer when I’m thinner - I was 60-70lbs less than what I am now - and last year for the first time I decided to just wear it - to just cherish my current body - whatever it may look like - and I think that’s been my biggest non scale victory <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 11:33 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Thank you for always saying all the right things ❤️
22/02/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Do we have authentic banana bread entries on myfitnesspal??
22/02/2025, 5:16 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Na poochein.
22/02/2025, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. It depends on the recipe. Each banana bread will be different in calories.
22/02/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But you can use an entry that’s close to the average of the ones listed
22/02/2025, 5:18 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: I had like two three bites of it only but felt it was too oily 😩
22/02/2025, 5:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe just set aside 80-100 calories.
22/02/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Okay

22/02/2025, 9:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you see a doctor?
22/02/2025, 9:41 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @60193244266 g Mai medicine use Karti hon yeh migraine problem mujy2014 say start hai. <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 10:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No improvement in 10 years?
22/02/2025, 10:17 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Kabi gap ajata hai kafi time k liye Kabi bar bar trigger HOTA hai last year bi pehlay rozay pay 3pm k baad start hua tha k iftari tak nai Bana sakhi thi different reasons hai
22/02/2025, 10:18 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Mujy light stress meal gap Pani Kam peeny aur Kuch food reaction say HOTA hai.
22/02/2025, 10:23 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Did you get your eye sight checked?
22/02/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): G bilkul eye test bi MRI scan sub test huway hain MRI 3 bar hua
22/02/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Well, i cannot tell you completely of course, you must have different reasons but i have been dealing with migraine since 10-11 years too and for me more than medicine it has been my daily life routine that has helped me. 
Stress being the worst reason of course but you will have to understand and manage it
22/02/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Contrast MRI?
22/02/2025, 10:27 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Colour?
22/02/2025, 10:28 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: It helps identify the problem better
22/02/2025, 10:30 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Hunger triggers it but you can manage it like in ramzan try fibre rich foods and complex carbs with of course protein. 
Keep your water intake fine like iftar k bad se you can hydrate yourself aram se. 
Sehri mein bht zyada pani pe lenay se pani store nae hou jata so hydrate yourself properly.
22/02/2025, 10:31 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Sehri achi hoti hai tou iftar tk it helps.
22/02/2025, 10:32 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: What i do is i start a little intermittent fasting so that i can get used to of the ramzan regime because this happens to me too but i hit my protein goal with that fasting and it prepares me for Ramzan
22/02/2025, 10:33 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: These are the few things that has helped me, I hope it helps you too
22/02/2025, 10:34 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: What has the doctor suggested?
22/02/2025, 10:37 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Stress Kam Karna hai medicine n Khana proper aur time pay layna hai change routine
22/02/2025, 10:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Was going to say this. 

Most people don’t get basics nutrients in Ramadan or dehydrated and that can trigger it.
22/02/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: It does and it can be managed. We all get so dependent on medications that we think we dont have to make any other changes but that is not the case. Medicines suppress it for some time but when it is triggered again because of the same reason, you need to make some changes in your life style. Hope it helps
22/02/2025, 10:49 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: @923130576941
22/02/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): G bilkul kabi gap ajata BOhot Acha chal Raha HOTA hai but trigger ho jata hai n 7 to 10 days bus phir gaye. <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 11:12 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Migraine triggers have multiple factors/reason. You have to identify the underline reasons as well with this hunger, dehydration, meals gaps things.

Then it will help you to reduce their triggers. If you haven't consulted with a psychologist yet. Please go for this. Therapy will help you too  😊
22/02/2025, 11:18 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: do we have the calories for plain popcorns?
22/02/2025, 11:18 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: in cinemas
22/02/2025, 11:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you will easily find an entry for it in the app & for caramel popcorns too n all the other variants as well
22/02/2025, 11:36 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): G 2014 say ABI tak Maine isk liye BOhot doctors psychologist neurologist say treatment karwaya n treatment li hai aur time k Saath Thek bi hua aur gap bi Aya but kabi trigger ho janay pay worst situation ho jati hai.
22/02/2025, 11:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I truly understand this. Do you know the triggers? Like any time, place, incident, situations or something.
22/02/2025, 11:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Small will be 650-850
Large will be 1200-1450
22/02/2025, 11:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Unfortunately you can’t get rid of migraines. There’s no cure. 

They’re like headaches. 

They will happen from time to time. For me, I’ve become an expert in sensing them. 

A day before, I tell my wife, I’m going to get a migraine tomorrow and so I take synflex preemptively and it’s so much better that way. 

My usual trigger is sleep deprivation for a couple of days or so
22/02/2025, 11:45 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Sleep deprivation, strong sun, tension, cheese, chocolate, dehydration there are so many many many causes. Even genetics ! My mother would get terrible ones for the longest time. She went thru so many doctors and medications and elimination diet. She now finds 2 neurofen (200 mg each) and 1 panadol (500) helps the most.
22/02/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But its one of those things you sort of have to learn to live with. Sometimes they get better with age, mine have Allah ka shukar !
22/02/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Nuberol forte for extreme 
Otherwise i would just sleep.
22/02/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Yes Kabi kabi mai aisi Jaga Jana avoid Karti hon jahan Zara environment Kuch tension wala ho ya aisi Jaga jahan cross ventilation na ho band ho Jaga jab Mera migraine trigger ho Raha ho Tou mujy fresh air chaye Hoti hai
22/02/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Yes mai starting Mai synflex say start Kiya tha aur BOhot time tak use ki hai but aik time pay mujy Kuch bi nai asar Kar Raha tha us time mai injection pay agai thi.
22/02/2025, 11:50 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): G ab Mai nuberol forte use Karti hon
22/02/2025, 11:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nuberol forte and panadol do nothing for me. It’s like throwing a glass of water to calm a forest fire
22/02/2025, 11:53 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Panadol is a scam for me 😂 even for a fever
22/02/2025, 11:53 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Yes light stress cheese chocolate coffee meals  gap dehydration n insomnia main reason hai mai online kitchen bi run Karti thi but 2023 Mai Chor Diya kyun k bar bar trigger honay ki waja say koi kaam nai ho sakhta tha
22/02/2025, 11:55 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Local panadol yes ! Imported ones are good. But everyone has their own remedies. My brother in law used to keep an oxygen cylinder at home and inhale it when he’d get a bad episode. It helps dilate the vessels
22/02/2025, 11:55 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Yeh sae BAAT hai mairay doctor nay aik bar Kaha tha k migraine Ka cure nai hai aur Jo cheez long terms pay chali Jaye Tou ap ink Saath manage Karna ki try Karo.
22/02/2025, 11:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Imported ones are a scam for me too lol. Synflex or jump of a roof. 

Those are my two options.
22/02/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I also have multiple triggers. One of them is cross ventilation but it's not the worst one for me and sleep deprivation is not my trigger mostly. It can be hormonal, stress, any trauma, etc etc. 

After a few years, I also can sense my migraine before, like Sameet shared. But it was not easy. Yes, you cannot cure it but you can only manage it, if you know the triggers and factors.
23/02/2025, 12:02 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Jump of roof is a good option in this situation 😂
23/02/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Last week Mai apni sister k ghr gai thi aur jatay Saath he Maine Kaha k cross ventilation nai hai BOhot ajeeb SA ho Raha hai mujy migraine ho Jaye GA Tou sub kehty k Sardi ho rahi hai Kuch nai hota but 20 mins k Ander mujy migraine trigger ho Gaya tha aur maine in drive bhook ki aur itni dair tak bahir jaa k baiti rahi kyun k bahir hawa chal rahi thi aur barish ho rahi thi iski waja say BOhot behter Raha
23/02/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: If it were my amma she’d say dawa kha k bhi yuhe hona hai tou yes jump off 😂
23/02/2025, 12:04 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): But honestly migraine KO sub mazaq aur drama he samjty Hain jab tak k khud KO na ho jaye
23/02/2025, 12:04 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Never believe in "k Kuch nhe hota". Always set yourself on priority.
23/02/2025, 12:05 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Agreed. Jis ko hota hai, he/she knows only.
23/02/2025, 12:08 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Is fresh air aur cross ventilation k chakkar Mai mujy Adat hai terrace pay baitny ki Raat KO Tou Kaha jata hai k migraine nai hai yeh koi jinn hai ya churail har time inko fresh air chaye Hoti hai Jo sar KO lag Jaye Tou Thek ho Jaye ga

23/02/2025, 12:16 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Chalo. Yaar 🤦‍♀️
I totally understand this. I used to walk on the roof top at nights. Apni koe personal space bhi Hoti hai insan ki, aur mood bhi.  And my daddi Maa was on repeat like "Baal khol k oper maat Jaya kero is waqt, Jin churail chamar jaye gi, especially qanwari lerki ko" and I was like 🤦‍♀️please mujhy maaf Ker daen and same like this. So don't worry. Aisi baatain hoti rehti hain. Kuch logo ko hum nhe samjha sakty because they dont want to. 

So idher se soun k odher se Nikal daen. Yeh baatain kbhi khatam nhe honi, insan k khatam honay k baad bhi.

I usually go with cooked chicken thigh in this case. Is it fine? 
Because cooked chicken shows less calories in MFP. Guide pls.

24/02/2025, 6:02 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
24/02/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: @60193244266 just had a cup of tea for breakfast. Super rushed. Is it okay?
24/02/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: I have my fitness pal according to the macros you suggested
24/02/2025, 6:04 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: But the calories count is 1200 instead of 1700 you recommended. Is that okay?
24/02/2025, 6:07 pm - PF - Shaikh A B: Also wanna know entry for chapati aswell
24/02/2025, 6:22 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Is there a reason why you have set it much lower than the coach's recommendation? 🤔 <This message was edited>
24/02/2025, 6:24 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Couldn’t work out much! Apart from that, my appetite is not that much
24/02/2025, 6:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Look alright.
24/02/2025, 6:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The macros won’t be what I recommended if calories are lower. I’d suggest setting it to 1700
24/02/2025, 6:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Think of it this way, the only way you gained weight is because you were eating at least over 2000 calories. So the appetite is kind of there. 

Dropping calories too low can mean lack of energy and other issues as well (especially if you aren’t getting enough nutrients).
24/02/2025, 6:39 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: If I set it at 1700. And follow the workout regime from that sheet. Will I really be able to lose 40-45kgs in 7-9 months?
24/02/2025, 6:40 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: With thousands of crash and restrictive diets that I have followed previously, this seems too good to be true honestly 😂😩
24/02/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
This is what I am getting on 1700 based on the macros you suggested. Is this okay?
24/02/2025, 6:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: This. I have seen people drop their calorie intake drastically by themselves and then they complain of different health issues popping up
24/02/2025, 6:46 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Also, I have extreme insulin resistance. Is 40% carbs really okay? Why did my gynae restricted me to 1/2 roti only per day😩
24/02/2025, 6:47 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: I know i am asking a lot of questions. This is practically the first time I am getting right answers
24/02/2025, 6:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your gynae isn’t responsible for nutrition and you shouldn’t be looking to them for nutrition advice to be honest.
24/02/2025, 6:53 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I remember Sameet mentioned you've set a realistic timeframe and he advised you accordingly so you can implement accordingly
24/02/2025, 6:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why that specific a goal? What’s the reason behind it!
24/02/2025, 6:55 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): first because your gynae isnt a nutritionist so unless she has a degree in nutrition you shouldnt be listening to her nutrition advice 
Secondly there is absolutely no issue in having carbs if you have insulin resistance if you are doing everything else right like getting enough protein eating whole foods vegies fruits getting enough fiber prioritizing sleep for good recovery being active n working out <This message was edited>
24/02/2025, 6:56 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: First, I wanna conceive 
Second, My sister is getting married on December 4th and I really wanna wear anything I want. Right now, i cant even fit into XXL
24/02/2025, 6:57 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: I sleep during the day so I take melatonin for that. As I mentioned I work night shifts 
Please suggest some high fiber foods?
24/02/2025, 7:00 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Also, didn’t get the time to cook today. Can anyone suggest good takeout meals that go with my calorie count
24/02/2025, 7:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you are eating enough fruits veggies grains and whole foods then you will having a good amount of fiber
24/02/2025, 7:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): subway is always my goto option
24/02/2025, 7:04 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: I will also sort out the workout regime today. I have been a part of this community for a week and haven’t done anything. I dont know why I am super stressed about everything.  What if this doesn’t work out? What if i am not consistent enough? What if i am doing everything wrong?
I am super sorry for my ranting but I dont know who else to talk to about all of this <This message was edited>
24/02/2025, 7:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): instead of linking "what if" with all the negatives just for a month think how improved you will be if all it will work out for you 
Have faith in yourself, in us coaches & these highly supportive community members
24/02/2025, 7:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Then you'll keep trying. It's not about doing things perfectly all the time, it's about going back to doing things well every time you do falter. That's what consistency is
24/02/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Thanks guys! 
Will try my best.
24/02/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: In conclusion,
We are sticking to 1700 calories per day with 100-110grams of protein and mixing up the carbs and fats, right?
24/02/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: @60193244266 ^
24/02/2025, 7:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes exactly
24/02/2025, 7:32 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
Is this okay? From ever green?
24/02/2025, 7:33 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): There calories are inaccurate
24/02/2025, 7:34 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Any other option apart from subway? I hate subway😩
24/02/2025, 7:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nandos, BBQ, Burgers, Pizza, Chapati Rolls and so many options.
24/02/2025, 7:35 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Am I dreaming or what?😍
24/02/2025, 7:35 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Just wanna say this, you guys are amazing. 
All of you! 🫶
24/02/2025, 7:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine but by specifically 40-45kg. 

What matters is progress and progressing in a sustainable way. 

You can get there sustainably or you can take a crash diet approach. Both get you there. 

But if you focus on health and take a sustainable approach then you’re also way more likely to maintain that progress. 

In a crash approach, most people rebound. So what’s the point of getting there if you’re still stuck in that cycle. 

You mentioned you tried so many things before and those didn’t work. They didn’t work because the approach was wrong. 

So if you’re not changing the approach then long term you won’t make change.
24/02/2025, 8:10 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: I am all in for going through the consistent way. This diet seems vvv reasonable and manageable. Gonna stick to that and focus on working out. 
Wont push myself into any crash diet or course now. InShaAllah I will be able to keep this up
24/02/2025, 8:10 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
Tried breaking up nandos meal into this. Is this okay?
24/02/2025, 8:11 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
Did the same for chicken corn soup. Is this good?
24/02/2025, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You get nandos ki entries. 

What did you eat?
24/02/2025, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you make this?
24/02/2025, 8:56 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Nope! ordered from bamboo
24/02/2025, 8:57 pm - PF - Hina Faizan: <Media omitted>
Sameet would you recommend this instead of powder?
24/02/2025, 8:57 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: We do??!!! 
Didn’t have it yet. Planned beforehand. Will have my dinner around 12am
24/02/2025, 8:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same thing.
24/02/2025, 8:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This might have more calories though.
24/02/2025, 8:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Share a picture and I’ll guide you how to track it.
24/02/2025, 8:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No soup will have 40g protein. 5-10g at best. 

Do you have an idea of how much you had? Weighed it?
24/02/2025, 8:58 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Perfect! I will share before eating
24/02/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Couldn’t weigh it. At work but it was a normal sized bowl. They sent a lot but I had a normal sized bowl
24/02/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Hina Faizan: Will check
24/02/2025, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe just add a premade entry around 250-300 calories.
24/02/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Perfect
24/02/2025, 9:21 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf joined from the community
24/02/2025, 9:30 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: I have a quick question.... what is more important to remain in calorie deficit.... or tracking the macros?
24/02/2025, 9:31 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Ever since i have started i am for sure in calorie deficit.... that also even 200 300 lesser to what u people have set my target off
24/02/2025, 9:32 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: But if i come to macros... at time carbs are in minus... and at time fat.... protein pe tou faqeer ki bud dua hai... pura hojye to ballay ballay
24/02/2025, 9:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For weight loss, calories. 

But if you’re not getting enough protein then you run the risk of losing muscle. 

If you lose muscle, you’re worse off health wise and your immunity, recovery, hair and skin health will all go down. 

Not to mention other aspect such as bone mineral density and increasing rick of things like osteoporosis, arthritis, sarcopenia and fractures.
24/02/2025, 9:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is down to you and your food choices. 

Kissi ki bad dua nahin. Aap ko khud responsibility leni hogi.
24/02/2025, 9:37 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: I m trying my best to meet protein target... but lets c.. finding different alternatives also for protein intake.  Lately to bht si cheezein to track kerne k baad i got to know are source of carb and not protein... example daal
24/02/2025, 9:37 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: So yeah learning...
24/02/2025, 9:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. This knowledge is improtant and can help make changes overtime.
24/02/2025, 9:44 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: True
24/02/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you share your meals sometime on Facebook then we can suggest specific changes to help hit your protein targets.
24/02/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Sure i will start doing that now
24/02/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just share a full day ki meal pictures and how you tracked them and we’ll guide you.

24/02/2025, 9:58 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Hi everyone! I'm Muniba,
- 39 years old  
- Height: 5'4"  
- Current weight: 74 kg  
- I have PCOS and want to lose 10 kg while focusing on a healthier lifestyle.  
- I work out 3 to 4 days a week.  
- I was on keto until 2 years ago and successfully lost weight (from 82 kg to 58 kg).  
- Over the past 2 years, I’ve regained weight, and losing it has become difficult despite always being on a diet.  

I’d love some guidance on:  
- How to start this journey the right way?  
- How do I calculate my macros for weight loss with PCOS?  
- What should my daily calorie intake be?  
- What are the best foods to eat, and how much should I eat?  
- Any tips on managing PCOS while trying to lose weight?  

For me, weight loss has always been a struggle.
24/02/2025, 10:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hey Muniba, glad to have you here. 

You’ll need to make this post on the Facebook group and then I’ll reply to all these concerns and pointers.
24/02/2025, 10:05 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Oh ok will  post once my request is accepted.

24/02/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Typical. No long term solution on how to solve this issue for good?
24/02/2025, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t need to reduce calories for now. 

How long does it take to get better after the injection?
24/02/2025, 11:10 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Yes i have a herniated disc issue

25/02/2025, 12:35 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: @60193244266 i ordered 1/4th chicken lemon and herb with 2 sides. (Spicy rice and wedges).
How do I calculate the macros and calories now?
25/02/2025, 12:54 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): simply log as nandos quarter chicken, spicy rice & potato wedges
25/02/2025, 1:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Wedges ki entry nahin hogi so add fries
25/02/2025, 1:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
25/02/2025, 1:13 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: THE WEDGES HAD 546 CALORIES!!!!!!!😩
25/02/2025, 1:13 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: What if I airfry the wedges at home?
25/02/2025, 1:16 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
This is how it looks right now! My breakfast was tea, lunch was soup, and dinner was Nandos.

Is this okay? I think for the next time, I should skip wedges, no?
25/02/2025, 1:32 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Fries and wedges are deep fried.
25/02/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Sajal: Can somebody teach me how to track macros in diet?
25/02/2025, 12:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What are you struggling with? Have you read the guide?
25/02/2025, 12:22 pm - PF - Sajal: Guide in Facebook ?
25/02/2025, 12:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Everything is on Facebook
25/02/2025, 12:47 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: how can I log caribou's blue berry muffin ? 😬
25/02/2025, 12:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you share a picture
25/02/2025, 12:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): <Media omitted>

25/02/2025, 12:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks good.
25/02/2025, 12:55 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): or if it has a nutrition label then check what it says n log accordingly
25/02/2025, 12:57 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: ate it already 🫢😬
25/02/2025, 12:58 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: <Media omitted>
25/02/2025, 1:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): log it with this entry
25/02/2025, 4:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey @923170212338, I hear you. And honestly? It makes perfect sense why you're feeling this way. You don’t fully trust this process yet - because why would you? Everyone before us has failed you in some way, sold you fads, promised you results without actually helping you build something sustainable. So of course, there’s hesitation. Of course, there's doubt.

But here’s what I want you to know- I get it, like really!! I’ve started and failed at many things before. Businesses, friendships, relationships- nothing has ever been perfect. And I used to think that meant I was doing something wrong, that maybe I just wasn’t capable of getting things right. But I’ve realized that failure isn’t proof that we’re broken; it’s proof that we’re trying. And trying is the only way forward. It means we're alive, yeah?

So please, stop worrying about whether you’re doing this perfectly. Perfection isn’t the goal. Learning is. You’ll figure out what’s right for you by moving through the uncertainty, not by avoiding it. And we’ll be here to guide you every step of the way- infact everyone's rooting for you here.

And like @923002699437 said above, it's not about doing things flawlessly. It’s about coming back to it every time you falter. That’s what real consistency looks like. And that’s what we’ll build together. You’re not alone in this. 💙

Have some faith in us, and more than that, in yourself. Trust that you'll move through whatever comes up and we'll be right beside you on your journey.
25/02/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: How much fiber is good in a day ?
25/02/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: How much is too less and how much is too much ?
25/02/2025, 6:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm asking because sometimes stuff like beans and chickpeas and lentils give a lot of gas and bloating
25/02/2025, 6:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Which goes next day after a bowel movement. But I don't want to be gassy
25/02/2025, 6:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: For most people, 25-30g of fiber per day is a good target. Less than 15g is usually too little, and going over 50g might cause bloating or digestive discomfort

But it depends on your body and how much water you're drinking!
25/02/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Shall I include soluble fibres  instead of insoluble. I don't know if my question makes sense
25/02/2025, 6:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Some people are sensitive to these foods and experience these symptoms, some don't (you experience it more esp if you don't have it regularly)
25/02/2025, 6:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I think I'm on the lower side. But I still get bloating
25/02/2025, 6:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s not just about fiber but the type of food you’re eating! Any kind of lentils and I get bloated AF (triggers my IBS too) - now I often end up with an upset tummy. 😅 So I've started skipping lentils and don't have it anymore, AT ALL!
25/02/2025, 6:31 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also , at restaurant yesterday I had grilled chicken and after eating it I realized the bone inside was pink and chicken was undercooked. I didn't eat the undercooked parts but I still got allergy while sleeping. had to take antihistamine. Does that mean my gut is sensitive ?
25/02/2025, 6:31 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I love brown daal chalwal . And kidney beans and channay
25/02/2025, 6:31 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: They all give me gas
25/02/2025, 6:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm not diagnosed with IBS
25/02/2025, 6:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: I love daal chawal as well, but don't like how it makes me feel anymore, so I skip it altogether!
You could also consult a gastroenterologist about these sensitivities and they might help.
25/02/2025, 6:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: It could be a mild food sensitivity or just bad luck this time
25/02/2025, 6:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Never thought about it. I was asking that may be I have to incorporate anything with these things or keep it in less portion to make the effects less.
25/02/2025, 6:39 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Hoq do i track cooked qeema?
25/02/2025, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Maybe the lentils aren’t being cooked properly? Soaking them for a few hours (or overnight) and then cooking them thoroughly until soft can help reduce bloating by breaking down compounds that can be harder to digest. Some people also find that adding cumin or ginger helps with digestion. 

But honestly, food reactions can vary, so consider keeping a food sensitivity journal- tracking what you eat and how you feel afterward can help you pinpoint what’s really causing the issue.
25/02/2025, 6:40 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Tomato and oil tou ill log seperate
25/02/2025, 6:40 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Bit hoq to do just cookwd qeema in fitnesspal
25/02/2025, 6:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track only minced beef and oil (unless there's more foods added in it that are high in calories like yogurt etc.)

FYI, 100g cooked beef = 135g raw beef

So adjust the quantity and add it accordingly!
You can find both cooked and raw entries in the MPF
25/02/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Ok . I have the track of yogurt too.. so ill put it in seperate
25/02/2025, 8:22 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Cooked qima kitny grams kha sakty he
25/02/2025, 8:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): there is no specific allowance for that 
whatever helps you in completing your protein intake and fits in your daily calories
25/02/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: <Media omitted>
25/02/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: <Media omitted>
25/02/2025, 8:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ye language kon c hai ?
german ?

You have to complete 43g protein so if it is beef qeema then 175-180g would do for you
25/02/2025, 8:29 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Italian
25/02/2025, 8:32 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Aur roti 60 grams tak theek rahy gi
25/02/2025, 8:40 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ma'am log both in the app n calories ka idea hojaega aapko
25/02/2025, 8:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That will be 140-150 calories. 

Ali is right, log what you’re planning on eating before eating and you’ll get an idea of what macros and calories will look like.
25/02/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: What can i drink instead of rooh afza in Ramadan?

25/02/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Neemboo pani. We make it for everyone with normal sugar. I have a small glass, never substituted for sweeteners. But i figure one small glass from a whole jug wont have so many calories… i hope !
25/02/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Sab ke hi 2 meals he sehri and iftari😇😇
25/02/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Dinner bhi hota hai🙈

25/02/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can divide calories into two meals. 

700 calories each roughly and 40-50g protein each.
25/02/2025, 9:20 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Last thing in my mind how can I keep part of my stomach empty according to Sunnah when I feel full with these calories?
25/02/2025, 9:21 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: 700 is too much 😭

25/02/2025, 10:32 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: No bs last 3 years se dihan nh dia
25/02/2025, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Which means you were likely eating a lot more calories than 1400 over the last 3 years. 

So you can definitely eat 1400. 

That’s how you can look at it.
25/02/2025, 10:33 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Sirf meetha kha kha k wo calories zada thi

25/02/2025, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But you can even aim for 1200-1400 if hunger isn’t an issue and you’re getting in your protein and vegetables.
25/02/2025, 10:35 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Perfect 👌
25/02/2025, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nahin. Iss main mazaak kya hai? Calories hain tou issue koi nahin magnum main.
25/02/2025, 10:36 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Oky nice pher to sab set ho gaya
25/02/2025, 11:43 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,
I have ended up having 640 more calories than target today. 
I don't know why I'm eating like crazy since tomorrow. ☹️ It's happening to me first time since November - I joined FoMo. 

It's due to illness post effects, recovery or stress. I'm unable to figure it out. Any guide coaches.
25/02/2025, 11:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be illness and your body needing more calories for recovery. 

Could also be stress eating and not having planned meals ready.
25/02/2025, 11:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm planning my meals. Making them ready too. But I'm eating fruits and chocolates like crazy with meals. 
And I'm not regretting adding them in MFP. Like no regrets after eating. 

Might be its recovery. I don't know btw.
26/02/2025, 12:10 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its not something to worry about a whole lot 
might be just a temporary thing while recovering & once will get better it will be alright but if it stays the same even after full recovery then we can discuss n fix it but for now its fine
26/02/2025, 12:14 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Thank you.
26/02/2025, 12:55 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Shadi se pehle 😆

26/02/2025, 1:08 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
Went to steakhouse today. Ordered a medium rare steak. First they serve me medium well done. And then the waiter trying to convince me this is medium rare 🤦🏽‍♂️quite pathetic for restaurant that boasts they serve the best steaks 😩

26/02/2025, 4:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh tou thori dair main Moo karnay wala hai 🤣
26/02/2025, 4:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah looks decent.

26/02/2025, 5:30 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Overnight oats main kitna protein hota hai ? Like in a normal serving

26/02/2025, 1:11 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Hellooo 🙋🏻‍♀️
I wanted to know that if a did a full body workout today, toh next day rest day lena zaruri hai? 
Or i can do a total body workout next day as well?
26/02/2025, 1:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: It depends on the intensity! If you're really sore, haven’t slept well, or feel like you haven’t recovered, then it’s better to rest or do something lighter. But if you're feeling good, you can do another full-body session - just be mindful of how your body feels. Another option is to focus on weaker body parts instead of hitting everything again, or even just do some cardio like a brisk walk - it’ll still feel productive without overdoing it!

Listen to your body! :)
26/02/2025, 1:16 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: I sleeeep really well almost everyday🤩 no compromise on my sleeep 🙊
 11-12 hours with my kids👧🏻 😃😃

27/02/2025, 3:57 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Seperate ingredients or create my recipe?
27/02/2025, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both options work.
27/02/2025, 6:40 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: For chukandar(beetroot) cooked... ill just log the oil and meat in it.. right?
27/02/2025, 6:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Can add some beetroots too if you want to more accurate. 

But if it’s a little bit then skipping it is okay too

Hi,

Estimated calories and protein for this burger. It was not oily at all. Grilled chicken so yeah. 

Or what should I add in MFP for this.
28/02/2025, 2:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Triple patty?
28/02/2025, 2:36 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes,
28/02/2025, 3:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 650-700 With like 55g protein
28/02/2025, 4:29 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: Hi, I’ve submitted my recommended calories on Facebook, but it’s still pending. Could you please guide me on the next steps?
28/02/2025, 4:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Will reply to it once I’m on my laptop. Will guide up through the next steps
28/02/2025, 8:38 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: How can I track calories on the MyFitnessPal app if I can't find accurate options with the specific grams listed?
28/02/2025, 8:41 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: <Media omitted>
Also, how can I track calories for this?
28/02/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Idk but that looks delishhhhh
28/02/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: Haha it was
28/02/2025, 10:33 am - You removed PF - Omey Farwa Salman
28/02/2025, 11:09 am - Taha Ahmed: If you can’t find an exact match with the specific grams listed on MyFitnessPal, try this instead:

1. Use a generic or raw entry- search for the food in its most basic form (e.g., “grilled chicken breast” instead of a branded entry or if possible, weight and track it raw) and adjust the grams manually
2. Check USDA or food databaseeEntries –eEntries with “USDA” or “generic” in the name tend to be more accurate than user-generated ones - we humans make a lot of errors!
3. Log a similar entry & adjust (what we prefer to do most times) - If an exact match isn’t available, pick the closest option and adjust the portion size based on your food scale - for example, if you had a beef burger with cheese, you can select McDonalds BigMac or something like that.
4. Break it down - If tracking a meal with multiple ingredients, log each component separately instead of searching for a single pre-made entry. Instead of logging "Chicken Karahi", add "Chicken", and "Oil" separately. It's moer accurate this way!
5. Save your own foods - If you eat the same thing often (for example, overnight oats with whey, fruits, etc), manually enter the correct macros once and save it as a custom food for future use.
28/02/2025, 11:11 am - Taha Ahmed: Now that I have shared how you can track foods differently in MFP, you tell me how you would track this as you know what all it's got? <This message was edited>
28/02/2025, 11:11 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: I tracked it like half avocado, with one fried egg and two sourdough slices.
28/02/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: Alright, seems a bit challenging as a beginner but hopefully will get the hang of it.
28/02/2025, 11:14 am - Taha Ahmed: Of course, it might feel like a lot and seem overwhelming at first, but trust me, you’ll start getting the hang of it in just a few days. It takes a bit of practice, but it definitely gets easier!  

I’ll let the other members jump in and share what worked for them. 😊
28/02/2025, 11:15 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: Okay, thanks a lot
28/02/2025, 11:15 am - Taha Ahmed: That fried egg is made in oil, right?
I'd add 1tsp oil too just for the sake of it
28/02/2025, 11:16 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: okay
28/02/2025, 12:30 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Can you pls guide me, should I add it with a quick add? Or which burger entry will be close to it?
28/02/2025, 12:36 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Track the ingredients. Like one egg, however much oil you used 1 tsp etc, bread if its sourdough you can add grams and then avocado also best to add by grams . If you have a food scale it makes life pretty simple. Seems tedious at first but then becomes second nature
28/02/2025, 12:38 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I used to enter omelette then sameet told me to break it down, like one egg or 2 eggs etc
28/02/2025, 12:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any entry that’s close to it should work. No need to break this into ingredients. 

Or you can also do it through quick ad.
28/02/2025, 12:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Noted. Thank you.
28/02/2025, 1:47 pm - You removed PF - Adeeba Saleem
28/02/2025, 2:24 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: If I make French toast with stevia, do I log that? (I mean stevia)
28/02/2025, 2:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: You can add it for tracking like how much you had in a day/week. Not for calories. 

This is what we have learned here.
28/02/2025, 2:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I don’t track sweeteners personally. No calories so no issue.
28/02/2025, 3:08 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: <Media omitted>
This is correct?
28/02/2025, 3:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup

28/02/2025, 11:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s a naan type, then 100g is around 300.

01/03/2025, 8:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 80-100 type
02/03/2025, 10:14 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 291 g chicken breast cooked
64 grams deens cheddar cheese
2 tsp olive oil
Roll patti 45 cals each.

This made 13 rolls. It comes to about 108 cals/ roll . Does that sound right ?
02/03/2025, 10:22 am - Taha Ahmed: 291g cooked chicken breast - around ~480 kcal
64g Deen’s cheddar cheese - ~260ish kcal
2 tsp olive oil - ~90 kcal
13 roll pattis (45 kcal each) - 585ish kcal
Total calories: ~1415ish kcal
Per roll: ~108-115 kcal (1415 ÷ 13)

So yeah, it seems accurate! :)
02/03/2025, 10:23 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Thanks !
02/03/2025, 10:29 am - Taha Ahmed: If you fry it in oil then add oil too!

02/03/2025, 10:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha yes!! It's one of the best inventions lol
Those who don't have an airfryer can use an oven and bake it (keep a tray underneath filled with water)

Placing a tray of water underneath can help create steam, which will prevent the rolls from drying out and keep them crispy on the outside and tender inside. If you do this, just make sure to monitor them, as cooking times might vary! 🫠

02/03/2025, 3:03 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: @923343773307 I have a huge sweet tooth. You know that. A huge chunk of my calories can come from it. They’re a form of snacks & binge. What do you suggest? How should I work on this?
02/03/2025, 3:14 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: How can I calculate the calories for sauces especially a homemade tamarind sauce per serving made from sugar?
02/03/2025, 3:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Having a sweet tooth isn’t a bad thing (it's what makes up a big part of our dietary intake these days)- with that comes more responsibility, so what we need is to to find a way to fit sweets into your diet in a more balanced way. For instance, instead of cutting them out completely (which often leads to stronger cravings), we can focus on making smarter swaps and adjustments. One approach I personally like is switching to healthier alternatives, like protein-based desserts (Greek yogurt with honey, protein brownies or protein powder, or a chocolate protein mousse), fruit-based options (frozen grapes/berries, banana with peanut butter, or dark chocolate-covered strawberries), or simple swaps like dates with nuts instead of just high-sugar snacks. Another way to incorporate sweets without going overboard is adjusting other parts of your meals- just like @60193244266  mentioned in this story, reducing oil in meals to make room for a small ice cream later. 
It’s all about balance! If your sweet snacks are taking up a big chunk of your daily intake, it would be helpful to audit your food inatke and see where we can improve to keep your cravings in check..
02/03/2025, 3:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just track the ingredients before making the sauces! For this tamarind sauce, I believe the only thing that has calories is sugar so just weigh it and track it
02/03/2025, 3:37 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: But how can I calculate for per serving?
02/03/2025, 3:39 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: Even if I weigh the sugar before making it, how can I measure for one spoon?
02/03/2025, 3:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: A simple hack for this: Weigh all the ingredients before making the sauce, especially the ones that contribute calories (in this case, sugar). Once your sauce is ready, weigh the total final batch. Now, divide the total calories by the final weight to get calories per gram. That way, whenever you take a serving, you can just weigh it and multiply by the per-gram calorie value.

For example, if you used 100g of sugar (which is ~387 calories) and your final sauce weighs 500g, then each gram of sauce would be 0.77 calories. If you take a 30g serving, that’s ~23 calories. This method works for any homemade sauce!

@everyone - star this message for later use :)
02/03/2025, 3:40 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: Alright, thanks a lot!!
02/03/2025, 3:42 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: should I weigh the sauce before adding the sugar or after? <This message was edited>
02/03/2025, 3:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just weigh the sugar, unless there's other stuff in it that has calories too

So I estimated it like this. Took high Calories fruit on high grams (almost half). 
I hope it's okay?
02/03/2025, 9:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. This is good.

03/03/2025, 11:10 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: I dont know where to start from😄
I gained alot of weight in past few months,
Also when i realised i made some efforts & i was able to loose 5kgs by myself, i have beeen working out 🏋️‍♀️ from past 11 years now, & everytime i was able to loooose weight, gain strength, but this time it was completely different i was completely lost,depressed 😭 since January i have beeen stuck on the same weight, no changes in my body as well, i was not able to understand this plateau, according to me i was doing everything right, calorie deficit, strength training, steps & what not, but the scale promised not to move😒
Then i joined FOMO, 
Tbh, it’s just been two weeeks, and i feeeel so happyyy, at first when i subscribed i was so confused & i couldn’t understand a thing & i was wondering whyyyyy did i subscribe?
But seeeeing everyone on the same boat, sharing this journey with all of you, hearing to all of the problems & questions i realized I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE🥲 
Honestly @60193244266 & @923343773307 you are the only person i can blindly trust, & now @923441183411 as well🤩 

I had a consultation call with @923343773307 & he made me believe in myself♥️ 

I am enjoying my journey (lifestyle)
Focusing on protien ( pehle kabhi itna zyada nai kiya) 😄
Calorie counting (which i find hard sometimes & other days i enjoy doing that)😄

Knwoing my current situation , @923343773307 & @60193244266 You Guys are a blessing in my life, thankyou for believing in me♥️
Blessss you😇
03/03/2025, 12:36 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: @923441183411 you had once mentioned how you make a chicken tikka in the air fryer i think ? I cant seem to find the post. I’m pretty sure it was you
03/03/2025, 12:37 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Am going to finally unbox mine today. Have done the marination, need to know temps and time

Is it good to add in my iftar, also how about the nutrition facts mentioned?
03/03/2025, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How does it have protein? When it’s sweet potato fries
03/03/2025, 5:33 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: 0 carbs?  😬
03/03/2025, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I’d go with another brand. Inkay facts bilkul bhi facts nahin.
03/03/2025, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nutritional fiction hai yeh
03/03/2025, 5:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
These are from their website
03/03/2025, 6:32 pm - PF - Sana Imran: How much calories will one Aloo samosa have ?
03/03/2025, 6:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 250-350.
03/03/2025, 7:10 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: <Media omitted>
Air fryer experiment no.1 was a success !
03/03/2025, 7:13 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Omg that’s too much
03/03/2025, 7:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks amazing
03/03/2025, 7:14 pm - PF - Sana Imran: If 33g protien is left what’s the easy way to have it
03/03/2025, 7:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): airfry it & these calories will be reduced considerably
03/03/2025, 7:15 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: The nimco aloo samosa is 95 calories i think. If u airfry it will be thag much only
03/03/2025, 7:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you want to have it all in 1 serving with 1 food then 110-120g chicken breast 

else you can make a combo chicken/beef with rice/roti/tortilla/spaghetti 
Or make a combo of foods like eggs/chicken/beef with some carbs
03/03/2025, 7:18 pm - PF - Sana Imran: I already had a tortilla with 80 gm of chicken grilled
03/03/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can have greek yogurt or whey protein
03/03/2025, 7:18 pm - PF - Sana Imran: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 7:19 pm - PF - Sana Imran: How much Greek yogurt ?
03/03/2025, 7:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 250g anhaar's greek yogurt is 250ish calories with 22-23g protein bki 10g aap eggs sy ly lo 1 whole n 1 white will be 10-11g protein <This message was edited>
03/03/2025, 7:31 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Ok great thank you
03/03/2025, 7:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Deep fried so yeah.
03/03/2025, 7:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Beef/chicken  burger
03/03/2025, 7:40 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm waiting for my air fryer. This deep frying is 😭
03/03/2025, 7:58 pm - PF - Sajal: Is it oka to skip workout and focus on diet only in ramdan?
03/03/2025, 7:58 pm - PF - Sajal: And what would be the possible reasons to have so much pain in legs?
dehydration?
03/03/2025, 8:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also bake this stuff for a very similar end result
03/03/2025, 8:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes but you’ll likely lose muscle and strength. 

A better approach might be to shift to 2 small workouts a week that help prevent muscle loss.
03/03/2025, 8:09 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Baking 🤨
03/03/2025, 8:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
03/03/2025, 8:50 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Which air fryer is the best?
03/03/2025, 8:51 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: So quickly muscle loss? I used to think that was a line gyms used to keep business.
03/03/2025, 8:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So quickly? It’s a whole month.
03/03/2025, 8:52 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes but when y restart it comes back pretty quick too no?
03/03/2025, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, but why do you want to lose it in the first place when you can maintain it easily with just a couple of quick workouts.
03/03/2025, 8:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: @60193244266 Is it that much of muscle class in a month?
03/03/2025, 8:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Matlab, considerable.
03/03/2025, 8:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I understand alternative hai, to get a few workouts to maintain it but never thought it was considerable
03/03/2025, 8:56 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Its tough ! I nearly didn’t go today, tho i was happy i did. But as mums its not like we can go post iftar etc with kids and all… and beforw iftar one is totally zapped. Needs a lot of will power !
03/03/2025, 9:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What do you mean? Is the muscle loss considerable?
03/03/2025, 9:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: To be honest, everyone needs will power for it. 

I’m like a mum. I’m the stay home parent. I’m the one playing with Zidane and picking him from school and all. 

But that doesn’t mean I let my goals slip. If I did, what kind of example am I setting? 

That’s how I look at it.
03/03/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And I go 5 days a week. If it’s difficult, we can do 2 small workouts. 

Even before Iftar is fine. Just don’t get caught up in your own head.
03/03/2025, 9:21 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I mean, I just want to know how considerable. Lets say a person has 10kg muscle mass with exercise. Are we saying he will lose 1kg or 10% or is it like 1%? I know ANY muscle loss is not a good idea but just wondering.
03/03/2025, 9:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro maintaining muscle requires like 1/3rd of the effort thats required to build it at first. If you do fatloss then a slight loss in muscle just happens like 2ish percent so if you have 10kgs muscle then 2% will be like 200g
03/03/2025, 9:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): which is overall like not considerable 
so if you can maintain with a minimal effort if your nutrition recovery is on point
03/03/2025, 9:49 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ya true but was just curiousp

03/03/2025, 9:52 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Without oil ghee
03/03/2025, 9:54 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: <Media omitted>
03/03/2025, 9:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can’t really say anything about calories without looking at what it looked like.
03/03/2025, 9:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But 50g main 120 calories is probably realistic.
03/03/2025, 9:59 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Camel meat s bana hai
03/03/2025, 10:29 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: It’s like haleem but this has more wheat/less meat and is bland
03/03/2025, 10:32 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Haleem me lentils hoti hai mere khyl s itna hi difference hain

Are these calories correct for Paratha?
04/03/2025, 2:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to weight the final paratha
04/03/2025, 2:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And add that weight as roti
04/03/2025, 2:47 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Urm i dont get it
04/03/2025, 2:47 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: What about the ghee
04/03/2025, 2:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’ll be added separately
04/03/2025, 2:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: So for instance if you weigh the paratha and it’s 100g
04/03/2025, 2:49 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Ohhh like the final weight roti plus the ghee
04/03/2025, 2:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then you add 100g roti and whatever amount of ghee you used to make it
04/03/2025, 2:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Or you’ll need to weigh the flour used before cooking. But 1 cup flour isn’t 35 calories.
04/03/2025, 2:49 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Will do it! But is this a good option? I cant survive sehri without paratha and dahi
04/03/2025, 2:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 cup flour is 455 calories
04/03/2025, 2:50 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Oh my god
04/03/2025, 2:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can. I’d advise reducing the amount of ghee used. Some people make it in 1 tsp ghee. You can 2 tsp. That’s 80 calories instead 245 that you’re using abhi
04/03/2025, 2:51 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Yeah the ghee is definitely gonna be lesser than this.
04/03/2025, 3:03 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: @60193244266 what if I make my paratha with that “chakki walay atta” 

Does it make any difference? Fine white flour and brown whole wheat flour?
04/03/2025, 3:40 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For calories, nope.
04/03/2025, 3:55 am - PF - Asma Tariq: "Chakki Walla atta" roti/paratha makes you more filled. That's what I personally observe.
04/03/2025, 3:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For some, that might happen because of the slightly extra fibre and the slightly slower digestion.
04/03/2025, 3:57 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly.
04/03/2025, 4:59 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Hey,
Is it the right green tick entry for cooked bhindi?
04/03/2025, 5:00 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): works for bhindi but oil alag sy add krna hoga na
04/03/2025, 5:01 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it depends how oily it was
04/03/2025, 5:06 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Salan made for all. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yes, I logged 1tsp oil as well. It was not too much oily.
04/03/2025, 5:08 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): make it 1.5 just to be on the safer side
04/03/2025, 5:20 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Done 👍
04/03/2025, 11:47 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
@60193244266Half boiled? Can you explain this please what’s the reason behind this
04/03/2025, 11:50 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): He was just telling you about his preference in somewhat a sarcastic manner, nothing scientific he meant
@60193244266
04/03/2025, 1:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha
04/03/2025, 1:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Every other method is 🤢🤢🤢
04/03/2025, 1:09 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: How many minutes is this ? I’ve tried to tell my cook so many times but he insists on giving me eggs i can play tennis with 😂
04/03/2025, 1:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 8 mins and add the eggs after the water is boiling.

I am confused 🫤
04/03/2025, 7:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Raw.
04/03/2025, 7:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 88g
04/03/2025, 7:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
This is the correct entry
04/03/2025, 7:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: If a pakora is for 30-40 cal.
I am assuming it's without oil. Right?
 I should log 1tsp oil as well?
04/03/2025, 7:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 100%
04/03/2025, 7:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): per pakora like 1.5tsp oil
04/03/2025, 7:35 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Done 👍 
Wesay I also logged 1.5tsp for one pakora.
04/03/2025, 7:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bilkul sae
04/03/2025, 7:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
04/03/2025, 9:11 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: <Media omitted>
I didnt measure this but logged it as 100g black eyd beans ? Its showing 336 cals ??
04/03/2025, 9:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): instead of black eyed beans just log as cooked white kidney beans or even cooked lentils will work
04/03/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Ok ! I was wondering so many calories !
04/03/2025, 9:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: These are called black eyed peas. <This message was edited>
04/03/2025, 9:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Had them today too
04/03/2025, 9:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s probably for raw 100g of them
04/03/2025, 9:55 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Oh yes ofcourse ! I got worried

05/03/2025, 4:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe use Nimco samosa entries
05/03/2025, 4:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s likely 60-80 per samosa.
05/03/2025, 4:49 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Okay... These are like small ones

05/03/2025, 3:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Your fat intake isn't negative. This means your goal was 58g fat per day, you ate 64g and went over by 5ish g

That's why it says *"-5"*
05/03/2025, 3:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: As long as you're under your caloric intake, going over one or two of your macros is okay

Hey,
Is this the right entry for the cooked Moringa leaves (Sohanjna)? If it's right, how many grams in one cup? Guide pls.

I will log 1.5 tsp oil and chicken separately as well, because it's chicken and Sohanjna (Moringa leaves) Ka salan for dinner today at home.

05/03/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Nefis not nafees

maybe different term can be used instead of real
05/03/2025, 11:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro its greek yogurt just flavors added hain & you get a good amount of protein out of it
05/03/2025, 11:49 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Anhaar is gelatinous
05/03/2025, 11:49 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: i am not saying its not yummy or full of protein
05/03/2025, 11:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: besides Anhaar itself doesnt claim its greek yogurt
05/03/2025, 11:51 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: its greek STYLE yogurt

06/03/2025, 12:02 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i will check the ingredients but its locally made so geletin ka case mushkil hai but i'll check

06/03/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Greek style is just normal yogurt thickened using ingredients like gelatin or cornstarch and ya anhaar and that other nafis or whatever one are Greek style
06/03/2025, 12:03 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i read somewhere that to be labelled as greek yogurt the product must be produced in greece else it is greek style yogurt
06/03/2025, 12:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No no. That’s not true.
06/03/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Thickened to mimic the consistency of Greek yogurt
06/03/2025, 12:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Exactly. It’s regular yoghurt that looks like Greek yoghurt.
06/03/2025, 12:04 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Greek yogurt is heavily strained, Greek style is not
06/03/2025, 12:04 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: How can it have the same macros though?? Shouldn't protein be lower then?
06/03/2025, 12:04 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: yep anhaar has somewhat of jelly style consistency, not exactly jelly but close
06/03/2025, 12:04 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: and I ate a lot of Anhaar <This message was edited>

06/03/2025, 12:05 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: heavily strained, yea

07/03/2025, 12:05 am - PF - Arusha Adnan: I can't even explain, they called it an aloo paratha, but it was more like a flatbread, a sad attempt by australians🥲

08/03/2025, 5:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): like doing right in what way ?
Just asking if you are doing right is somewhat vague

this looks like 20ish grams of protein 16-18g carbs & if u had both the yolks then 15-20g of fats or more maybe  depending upon how much oil u used for making this kabab.
08/03/2025, 5:24 am - PF - Nida Jamshaid: <Media omitted>
08/03/2025, 5:24 am - PF - Nida Jamshaid: 2 egg white and 1 chicken kebab in air fryer

How to track my calories 
Is it enough food for Sehri
08/03/2025, 5:26 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): please show what did you enter in the app to log these foods
08/03/2025, 5:26 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Tap on diary
08/03/2025, 5:27 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): dont worry you will learn it might take just a few days to get used to it but you definitely are gona learn
08/03/2025, 5:28 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if these macros are for this meal only then u didnt log the foods properly 
Show the food diary & i'll tell
08/03/2025, 5:29 am - PF - Nida Jamshaid: Ok wait
08/03/2025, 5:29 am - PF - Nida Jamshaid: <Media omitted>
08/03/2025, 5:32 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u had just the white part of the eggs so no need to log the whole eggs. Search egg whites & log for 2 egg whites 
U had 1 chicken kebab but you logged for 2 & this sized 1 kebab cant have 190 calories. So either search for chicken shami kebab or you can search for K&Ns chicken shami and log for 1 kebab. You didnt use any oil for cooking so no need to add oil
Green tea is calorie free unless u added any sugar but if u didnt then dont log for green tea
08/03/2025, 1:32 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: how to track them?
08/03/2025, 1:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll track the batter. How many grams of besan you added, plus potatoes and onions

Kachnar and Qeema salan ~ 150gm (cooked for all so don't not gross weights) 

How should I break kachnar and Qeema's weight? 
I estimated cooked lamb broiled 60g and kachnar 90g.
Oil 2tsp.  Is it fine? Or any guide.

Plus what to log for kachnar flowers in MFP? There were weird names when I googled it.  😕
10/03/2025, 8:29 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it seems mostly qeema 
So log as 100g qeema & kachnar is a vegetable 50g wont have as much calories so na b krain log to chalyga

11/03/2025, 7:58 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I think just track banana, and then if u added sugar maybe a teaspoon ? Coaches can confirm
11/03/2025, 8:04 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: No sugar. No juices...used stevia and chat masala and lemon
11/03/2025, 8:05 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Fruits apple, banana, grapes and strawberry.
11/03/2025, 8:06 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Then just track banana (i think that’s most dense).. 182 grams of banana
11/03/2025, 8:07 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Track banana and apple strawberry is low calorie not sure about grapes
11/03/2025, 8:09 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: This tracking part is so complicated I am still struggling  with it.🫣
11/03/2025, 8:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just track it all as one or two fruits. 

Keep it simple like everyone suggested.
11/03/2025, 8:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I had a samosa, a sandwich, a half Shami anda burger and a pakora in iftar.

esi baat ignore karain because its basically non-sense
12/03/2025, 2:34 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: I'm a bit confused about how to track my calories during Ramzan. Sometimes, my snack is after 12 AM, so I’m unsure if that should count towards the existing day's calories or the next day's calories. Right now, I’m tracking it as part of the existing day’s intake, and then after Suhoor, I start tracking the next day’s calories. Could you clarify if that’s the correct approach?
12/03/2025, 2:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s no right approach. You can account it either way.
12/03/2025, 2:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I always count one day as when I wake up to when I sleep. The time on the clock makes no difference.
12/03/2025, 2:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hello, 
Any hack, tip or guide for iftar plus dinner invites? Bech mai tea time bhi. 
Phr sehri invites too. 

How are you people managing your portions in such situations? I'm just messed up in all this. 👀
12/03/2025, 2:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Eating out all day can be difficult.

One approach can be to just move to maintenance calories for that day.
12/03/2025, 2:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Another is to try and stay away from fried foods that can really add calories.
12/03/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: Alright, thank you
12/03/2025, 3:01 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yeah.

But it's really very challenging on the fest table .
12/03/2025, 3:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Because you’re hungry. This is where planning ahead can come handy. 

Focus on food that fit your goals first. Then focus on foods you want to try. 

You’ll be less likely to overeat when not starving.

13/03/2025, 7:59 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: I checked my weight today before iftar and i’ve lost 4.5 kgs & inches in 13 days 🙈 i mean i don’t know if its good or bad for a body but oh 🤌🏻
13/03/2025, 8:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s amazing. 

Why would it be bad? Do you mean it’s a lot of weight in two weeks?
13/03/2025, 8:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just amazing
13/03/2025, 8:12 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: Ive always heard in a week half kg is considered to be good to loose.. so i dont know im not sure about it
But im happy, i mean did put in efforts too.. 🙈
13/03/2025, 8:13 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Some say 1 kg per week is fine
13/03/2025, 8:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It depends on your starting weight. 

Also, you lose weight slightly faster in the beginning as well. 

With that being said, you should definitely take it as a win cause it’s a sign that your efforts are paying off.
13/03/2025, 8:16 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: Definitely
13/03/2025, 8:18 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: What all did you do ? That really is amazing weight loss !
13/03/2025, 8:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is amazing tbh!
It's a win nonetheless. Take it!

Also, how are your energy and hunger levels overall?
13/03/2025, 8:35 pm - PF - Dua Ishaq: Alhamdulillah, feeling great and more energized than usual! I’ve been keeping busy with preparations for my upcoming travels. 
I’m sticking to just two meals a day Suhoor and Iftar focusing on high-protein options to stay fueled. 
I’ve also been doing low-intensity workouts with a few extra reps each day, and making sure I’m getting at least 10 hours of sleep. 😜😜
Seems like the combination is really working for me! 💃🏻
13/03/2025, 8:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Wow. 🤩 Keep it up girlie ✨
13/03/2025, 8:37 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: What do your macros look like ?  Even tho its different for each of us

Keep listening to your body, and if this approach feels great for you, that’s what matters most (cause it's unique to you and you only!). 
Also, exciting about your upcoming travels! Where are you headed now?
Hope you keep this energy and approach going wherever you go. 🙌🏽

Add oil, if you used in cooking. 

I also had this in sehri.

As for my travels, my friend’s wedding is on Eid, so I’m off to the USA first. After that, I’ve got some work in Turkey, and then I’ll wrap things up in Pakistan for my sister’s engagement. That’s the plan so far! 🤞🏻

14/03/2025, 4:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. It’s just rice and vinegar.

14/03/2025, 7:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: On app?
See the label at the box. Match it with the app entry for accuracy.
14/03/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: No i mean on the box.
14/03/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Like a nimco aloo samosa is supposed to be 86 or 83 cals with 10 calories from fat. But my trainer was saying how can they caculate, they make everything even the samosa patti in bulk?
14/03/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. They look decent.
14/03/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Abay very easy to calculate. It’s an average. 

Ask him does he think that globally they measure every zinger to be exactly 570 calories?
14/03/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
14/03/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: They are accurate. 
I use sabroso most of the time.

If you have confusion, take a picture, share here and seek guidance from coaches.
14/03/2025, 7:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha exactly 🤣

But frozen foods are easier because they’re roughly the same size. And you can always weigh it out and track is as per weight rather than piece. 

So for instance if one piece is 30 g and they say it is hundred calories then on average every piece will be hundred calories, but certain pieces can be 95 cal in certain pieces can be 105 cal as well. 

If you want to be really accurate, you can just weigh the piece out and then track it as per grams.

15/03/2025, 12:14 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Which brand is this
15/03/2025, 12:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be depending on what they add. If they’re adding actual Lindt then should be higher unless they add like 5g chocolate

How does this look for an overnight oats recipe ? I’m not too keen on adding the protein powder as it becomes a bit like goop..
16/03/2025, 2:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: How does it look to you? Do you think you’d like its taste?
16/03/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: No 😄 because i have strawberry yogurt and chocolate protein powder
16/03/2025, 2:46 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I can skip the whey and just add more milk i guess ? And then some fruit on top
16/03/2025, 2:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Iss main oats kahan hain
16/03/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Oats replaced by weetabix
16/03/2025, 2:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Weetabix is probably the oats replacement :p
16/03/2025, 2:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha then make it however you like and how you’d enjoy it. Traditional recipes are fine, but I always tweak them to suit my taste
16/03/2025, 2:50 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Like give an example please
16/03/2025, 2:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s why it becomes goop lol.
16/03/2025, 2:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weetabix doesn’t absorb as much liquid as oats so you need to add liquids accordingly.
16/03/2025, 2:51 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Plz recommend any good flavor protein powder
16/03/2025, 2:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: So here's my goto:
Half cup oats (I prefer rolled oats for texture but if I don't have that, I just use instant oats)
1-2 scoop chocolate whey protein (or Greek yogurt if I don’t have whey)
Hafl cup cold milk (keeps the oats from getting too mushy :p secret ingredient!)
2 tbsp yogurt (adds creaminess)
A few crushed cashews (for that nutty crunch)
A little dark chocolate (because why not?)
Top with crunchy granola (adds the perfect texture and feels good when chewing)

Mix everything except the granola and dark chocolate, let it sit overnight, and add the toppings in the morning before you have it!
16/03/2025, 2:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: If I have fresh berries like (blueberries, strawberries), I add that too
I don't like bananas in this.
Sometimes I caramelize apples or peaches (if it's in season) and add that layer later
16/03/2025, 2:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: But that's^ my preference!
You may not like the taste of it
16/03/2025, 2:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Here’s mine that I’m having in sehri daily. 

I add some fruit and/or nuts on top when eating depending on leftover calories
16/03/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Oats ,
Milk and whey. Thats simple. 

Taha’s more gourmet restaurant 😄
16/03/2025, 2:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha my food has to taste good! 😋
I already can't have a lot of foods so it makes sense for me <This message was edited>

16/03/2025, 3:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly! Cooking is an experience for me, not just a task. The effort I put into it makes me appreciate my meals even more and my body thanks me. It’s like a little act of self-care- nourishing my body while also enjoying the process. Plus caramelized apples or peaches? Totally worth the patience!! 😋

P.S. When I am home, I keep a lot of it prepped already

How to track this Penne Arrabiata?
16/03/2025, 3:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: We are in fast 🙊. Sounds so yumm.
16/03/2025, 3:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Weigh your cooked pasta, note the amount of sauce or oil used (based on tomatoes, oil, garlic, and spices), and any added protein (like chicken or cheese). If it's homemade, input the recipe into MyFitnessPal

If it's from a restaurant, search for a similar entry in the app or estimate using a standard serving (e.g., 100g cooked Penne Arrabiata ≈ 150-250 kcal, depending on ingredients)

macrosfirst is my preferred one & MFP is good too
16/03/2025, 5:25 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay, and one more question 
sometimes if you search any food item as per their gram weight 
it shows different calories for the same gram weight 
how to know which is correct
16/03/2025, 5:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Honestly didnt get your question 
if you can show your tracking, i'll be able to answer better
16/03/2025, 5:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Some entries in tracking apps are 'user-made,' meaning anyone can create them. This sometimes leads to variations, even for similar food items.

If you're unsure which entry to choose, feel free to share it here, and we can guide you. Alternatively, you can go with an option that represents the average of most entries- ideally something in the middle or slightly on the higher end.
16/03/2025, 5:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Another way to check if an entry is accurate or verified is to look for the green tick mark. These entries have been verified by the app and are usually correct
16/03/2025, 6:01 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: @923343773307 please check my pending post <This message was edited>

17/03/2025, 3:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just going through them
17/03/2025, 4:24 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i usually make Greek yogurt at home, is it fine? 
like i use a strainer to strain out the whey and it takes around 4-5 hours to form a creamy texture 
and then i weigh it in grams to get the macros and calorie content
is it fine?
17/03/2025, 5:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah just use macros for a full fat Greek yoghurt
17/03/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: and if i specifically buy yogurt without cream/ malai?
17/03/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Even then that’s full fat
17/03/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ohhh
17/03/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: how do i get low fat then?
17/03/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ill have to buy?
17/03/2025, 9:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to buy low fat yoghurt
17/03/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you
17/03/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Nida Umer: What are the benefits of Chia seeds?
Lots of reels coming up to have in Ramadan 

Also does it have the same nutritional value as basil seeds (tukhmebalanga )
17/03/2025, 11:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a seed, seeds are pretty nutrient dense. 

Plus, it absorbs water so can have a hydrating effect. 

It’s also a source of fat so a slightly longer time taken to digest. 

Also packed with fiber so can help with appetite and hunger. 

And yes, basil seeds are similar.

Where do you buy your gym supplements in Malaysia, and what supplements do you take?
18/03/2025, 5:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rule1 website or MyProtein website
18/03/2025, 5:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve only been using whey and creatine for the past 6-7 years.
18/03/2025, 5:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And fish oil and vitamin D from a pharmacy.
18/03/2025, 7:10 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: When should we consider taking these supplements and how can we know we need it?
18/03/2025, 7:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just get a test done for it from a lab & you would know reports ki base py
18/03/2025, 7:14 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
18/03/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i was given sunny D 2 lac IU for about 4 weeks
18/03/2025, 7:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: as much as i know Vitamin D supplementation is important as we don’t have much sources 

My question is if I’ve taken 6-8 lac IU 
should I still take vitamin D this year?
18/03/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: is it stored in the body? or should i continue to take a around 600 IU once a day?
18/03/2025, 7:54 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi joined from the community
18/03/2025, 8:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: None of these supplements are such that you HAVE to get a test done. 

Fish oil is something I take because I don’t eat seafood. If you eat seafood 2 to 3 times per week, then you don’t need fish oil. Otherwise in my opinion, you should supplement with fish oil because it’s one of the few sources of omega-3’s that exist in our diet.
18/03/2025, 8:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For vitamin D, you can get it checked by a blood test, but usually most people are deficient and even if you’re not deficient, there’s no harm in taking a small maintenance dose which for most people will be about 2000- 3000IU per day.
18/03/2025, 8:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And then Whey and Creatine are for protein goals and performance.
18/03/2025, 8:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could. Depends on your current levels. I like to maintain my around 70-80
18/03/2025, 8:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Ok thank you 👍🏻
18/03/2025, 8:08 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Creatine  mainly kis purpose k lie consume krte hain?
18/03/2025, 8:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I have a question. 
Can we take creatine if we are not doing workouts?
But activity levels are good. Can you pls guide on this.
18/03/2025, 9:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can but since the biggest effect is related to muscle and strength, you won’t get that benefit. 

You’ll still get the cognitive benefits
18/03/2025, 10:19 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Great!

18/03/2025, 10:50 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: like i think 17 grams sugar / 100 gram  of this bar is moderate amount of sugar right?
18/03/2025, 10:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Good one. #taste

18/03/2025, 10:53 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its a very good brand 
look for the total calories in a serving n then protein. carbs n fats dont matter much as long as u r within your caloric budget
19/03/2025, 1:31 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: what about sugars?
19/03/2025, 1:31 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: and ingredients?
19/03/2025, 1:33 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: like im taking about in terms of health benefits too
19/03/2025, 2:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: As long as you’re covering protein, fats, fiber and basics like that. Then not really.
19/03/2025, 2:53 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you

20/03/2025, 12:29 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But its pretty low protein right ? Even tho i feel happier on it, couldnt have eggs at that time anymore
20/03/2025, 12:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah it’s probably like 15g?
20/03/2025, 12:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could add some whey

20/03/2025, 6:29 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923441183411 can you tell me if my rough estimation is okay?

The guy said you get 4 servings out of the recipe. I estimated the roughly 175 cals per serving and 4.5 g protein per serving
20/03/2025, 6:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 5 eggs - 70x5 350 calories
2tbsp cocoa powder - 25-30 calories
1 cup milk if 250ml - 150 calories approx. 
sweetener depend krta hai kon sa use kia hai if artificial then zero calories

So as per that 130-140 calories per serving
20/03/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Great. He used date sugar so I calculated accordingly
20/03/2025, 10:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bs phir to sae hai 
protein thori zada hogi around 7-8g
20/03/2025, 10:35 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Oh yes I made mistake calculating that. You're right thanks 👍🏼

21/03/2025, 8:50 am - Taha Ahmed: If it was 80% beef (ideal for kebabs), then calories will be around ~230ish <This message was edited>
21/03/2025, 9:16 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Wasnt home made..will change..thanks
21/03/2025, 9:19 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: And protein is ok?
21/03/2025, 9:22 am - Taha Ahmed: Then it might have more calories because outside they use 70% beef, 30% fat- 
Calories will go up, protein might go down a bit more

Also, if it wasn't homemade, add a lil more oil 😬
21/03/2025, 9:24 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I added 2 tbsp oil
21/03/2025, 9:32 am - Taha Ahmed: How many kebabs were there? :o <This message was edited>
21/03/2025, 9:39 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: 2 skewers. I had 95 gms from one skewer

Help me track the rice and chicken
21/03/2025, 3:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Since it's cooked (that means the meat has lost some water weight too), it'll defo have more a bit more calories I think!
21/03/2025, 3:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: 90-110g raw chicken breast
120g boiled rice
2tsp oil
21/03/2025, 3:36 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: Okay thanks
21/03/2025, 3:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve used this one. Decent entry.
21/03/2025, 3:43 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: just a question here, how do you add the 2 tsp oil, do you like see that the rice are somewhat oily or what..?
21/03/2025, 3:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: I cook for myself, and I’ve also observed others cooking when we eat out. So my estimations are based on knowing the recipes and personal experience
21/03/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: oh okay i got it!!
21/03/2025, 3:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: And yes, I can see the oil in food too :p
21/03/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahaha thanks
21/03/2025, 4:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup, as Taha mentioned. It’ll come with experience. 

It’s always better to overestimate with oil. So if I’m in a fat loss phase and I’m having something which I think is 2tsp of oil, I’ll usually enter 3 just to be safe.
21/03/2025, 4:59 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i got it, thank you

21/03/2025, 8:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 120-140 calories fruit chat 
chicken sticks must be deep fried so 120-130 per stick
60-65 calories in the date

21/03/2025, 8:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): *Taha's Version*

So here's my goto:
Half cup oats (I prefer rolled oats for texture but if I don't have that, I just use instant oats)
1-2 scoop chocolate whey protein (or Greek yogurt if I don’t have whey)
Hafl cup cold milk (keeps the oats from getting too mushy :p secret ingredient!)
2 tbsp yogurt (adds creaminess)
A few crushed cashews (for that nutty crunch)
A little dark chocolate (because why not?)
Top with crunchy granola (adds the perfect texture and feels good when chewing)

Mix everything except the granola and dark chocolate, let it sit overnight, and add the toppings in the morning before you have it!

23/03/2025, 8:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>
can you please help me track kalay channay
23/03/2025, 8:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Garbanzo beans boiled 
150g
23/03/2025, 8:21 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: <Media omitted>
This is how I tracked this 250 gm boiled rice
50 gm was beef shank
3 tbsp oil.. ( though  I made the entire family meal in 3tbsp but because of the bone marrow in the shank I counted  as 3 tbsp)

I calculated the rice first and them calculated the meet separately.
23/03/2025, 8:22 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Is this fine
23/03/2025, 8:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no 3tbsp is abit too much 
make it 3tsp
23/03/2025, 8:29 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: I wanted to ask is it okay if I meet my calorie target but fall short on protein intake once a week..
23/03/2025, 8:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes its fine 
just make sure u are not falling too short of the target
23/03/2025, 8:32 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Instead of 90-100 gms..you achieve 50gms..this generally happens when eating out..because I already reached my logged calorie  of the day so I try not to have whey protein. Or I should indulge in 120 calorie from whey protein for the protein intake. <This message was edited>
23/03/2025, 8:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): saving 100ish calories for whey isnt difficult even if eating out but lets say nhi bchti calories then you can have a scoop of whey & then next two days have 60 calories less than your daily budget n balance hojaega

25/03/2025, 2:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Steps increase the amount of calories you burn so it can make going into a deficit easier. 

Or can help make deficit bigger which means more weight lost.
25/03/2025, 2:04 am - PF - Zeryab Hassan: How long does it take the calorie deficit to work?

25/03/2025, 4:27 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Okay
25/03/2025, 4:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This is so disgusting. People don't understand, k is weight gain/loss k pechay bohat se factores or medical condition ho sakti. 

Na motay ko sakoon lenay detay, na patlay ko or na hi moderate ko.
25/03/2025, 4:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: People love to talk about this stuff- but remember, it’s them, not you. They’re just projecting their insecurities onto you.

Last year, I went through some serious medical and health-related challenges, which led to significant weight gain. I hit ~96 kg, and suddenly, people had a lot to say:
"Motay ho gaye ho."
"Ab achay nahi lag rahay."

Did it break me? Nope.
Did it affect me? Nope.
Did I take it personally? Nope.

What did I do? I just listened and moved on- except for one IG comment that I reacted to (because, hey, I’m human). But beyond that, I didn’t give it much attention.

You stop caring about what others think about your body when you truly start loving yourself, embracing your journey, and appreciating where you're at in life. 💙 I wish that for everyone to have in my community.
25/03/2025, 5:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's the sad reality of our society at large!
25/03/2025, 5:22 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: You are right. But sometimes it hits you so badly when you are struggling with so many other shits. Sometimes it tough to handle all thi.

But yeah at the end, Insan samjh hi jata hai that all what matters, is his/her own self.
25/03/2025, 6:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, absolutely. It is extremely difficult to move through this, especially when you're already carrying so much. This is why we need to be more compassionate- not just towards others, but towards ourselves too. You never really know what someone is going through, because most of us have learned to mask it so well. We put on a brave face, keep pushing forward, and barely talk about the weight we’re carrying. But that doesn’t mean it’s not there.

That’s why spaces where we can be real- where we don’t have to pretend- matter so much. Because healing doesn’t happen in isolation. It happens when we’re seen, when we’re heard, and when we remind each other that we’re not alone, and I'm genuinely happy to see that in our community, we don't do that shit and we all respect each other, make others feel seen and heard. Super important stuff tbh!
25/03/2025, 6:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: I just hope ye quality/skill sab insaanon ke andar aajaye!!
25/03/2025, 6:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: True that. ✨
25/03/2025, 6:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yupe! We hope so. 😊🌸

25/03/2025, 9:25 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Milk with malai and without malai have the same calories or is there any difference?
25/03/2025, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. Malai is fat so if you remove it then calories are lower.
25/03/2025, 9:29 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And then how will i track it?
25/03/2025, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What milk are you talking about
25/03/2025, 9:44 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: The kulha milk we get in pakistan
25/03/2025, 11:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track it as fresh milk then. Even if you take out some of the fat, it's still relatively higher in fat

26/03/2025, 2:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Homemade?
26/03/2025, 2:27 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Nope but it’s “fit burger” from smash burgers in Lahore
26/03/2025, 3:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just do a grilled chicken burger entry from kfc or someplace like that
26/03/2025, 3:05 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 484 tou waisay he hogayi
26/03/2025, 3:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Waisay this probably works too but I doubt they’re using 150g chicken
26/03/2025, 3:05 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 100g?
26/03/2025, 3:05 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: patty choti thi haan
26/03/2025, 3:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. 150g would be too big a patty for a burger.
26/03/2025, 3:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also was it grilled chicken fillet or like a patty?
26/03/2025, 3:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d reduce the patty to 100ish and add more mayo or sauces
26/03/2025, 3:07 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: just had their own sauce
26/03/2025, 3:07 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 2 tbsp?
26/03/2025, 4:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add another 2tsp.

How much calories and protein does this cover?
26/03/2025, 4:56 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Look likes 120-130g chicken breast so that will be 180-190 calories & 34-35g protein
Plus add the amount of oil used for cooking it
26/03/2025, 5:04 am - PF - Zeryab Hassan: Made it without oil

26/03/2025, 9:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It might but we can only estimate.
26/03/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How else would we know the accurate version?

The only other way is to weigh and track everything they add to it. 

But that’s not possible so you estimate it using other brands. 

The difference is likely going to be small because the ingredients are the same and the quantities are similar too
26/03/2025, 9:50 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Understood

Packet is showing 2 tortillas are 50 cal. But when i scan the bar code it goes upto 73. So stick with the packet right?
27/03/2025, 4:46 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Pack says serving size is 1 tortilla-18g & it has 25 calories 
So yeah 2 tortilla 50 calories so yeah you can stick with it
27/03/2025, 4:52 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Thanks..Weight is also 36g for 2

27/03/2025, 5:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fried fish?
27/03/2025, 5:17 am - PF - Zeryab Hassan: Must be, I took it from my university cafe.
27/03/2025, 5:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g cooked pasta
140g fried fish fillet
30g ketchup
40g sour cream
1-2tsp oil (for safety)
27/03/2025, 5:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s going to high in calories
27/03/2025, 5:28 am - PF - Zeryab Hassan: That was basically my purpose to ask because I usually have no idea about portions and how much calories it would have, so next time when I take it would be in my mind.
27/03/2025, 5:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Anything fried and with cream with be high calorie. So that’s usually a good tell.
27/03/2025, 5:31 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I meant, I weighed them to make sure they were 36g. Otherwise wouldve adjusted calories accordingly
27/03/2025, 5:31 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Okay its good that you double checked to be sure👌

And 57 grams of gravy
27/03/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: How can I track this

27/03/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: How do we track chicken with bones differently from boneless chicken, or is it the same entry? We just track through gms.
27/03/2025, 3:09 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): once you finish eating weight the bones n subtract that weight from the initial weight 
e.g if initial weight is 200 n bones after eating is 50g then track as 150g boneless
27/03/2025, 3:57 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Do we need to track Shaan masalas or other packet masalas, or is it not required.
27/03/2025, 3:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no we dont

27/03/2025, 11:37 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Normal  beef cheese burger or mr burger
27/03/2025, 11:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): double patty ?
27/03/2025, 11:38 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: No no single
27/03/2025, 11:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): search for quarter pounder with cheese
27/03/2025, 11:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This could be accurate for their small beef burger. Not Mr. Burger wala burger.
27/03/2025, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This isn’t bad calorie wise but no way does it have 45g of protein. 

Like @923441183411 said, go with Quarter pounder with cheese.
27/03/2025, 11:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
27/03/2025, 11:47 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>
This has 518 calories
27/03/2025, 11:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So calories wise which one should I consider 
518cal or 395 cal
27/03/2025, 11:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you have their beef burger or their Mr burger.
27/03/2025, 11:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Those are two separate burgers
27/03/2025, 11:50 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Mr burger
27/03/2025, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then this
27/03/2025, 11:51 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: And If I remove the upar wala bun how many calories will be reduced
27/03/2025, 11:54 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Then kfc zinger also has 570 cal without cheese so will it make any difference if I eat the zinger then 
Just a confusion
28/03/2025, 12:12 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Burger is a burger wo khao aap ya Kfc
28/03/2025, 12:14 am - Taha Ahmed: A burger bun is typically 55-60g and has around ~160-175 kcals. Divide it into two and you'll have half the calories i.e. 80-87 kcal
28/03/2025, 12:19 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Hmm ok
28/03/2025, 12:29 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: But grilled is more preferable  then deep fried chicken fillet in a zinger
28/03/2025, 12:30 am - Taha Ahmed: It's a preference, like you said.
You can choose to eat grilled, boiled, or fried. :)
28/03/2025, 12:30 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: It has bread crumbs  oil so no difference  in calories bit tricky
28/03/2025, 12:31 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Boiled 👀

28/03/2025, 2:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just put chicken thigh around 155g. 

You can always estimate the weight of the bones. 

Calories for the chicken will be much lower than 373. Closer to 200.

Easiest way to get 40-50g of protein in a sitting.
30/03/2025, 11:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I don’t. Eid is a couple of days so you can choose to be mindful and aim for rough maintenance around that time. Once it’s over, go back into a deficit.

01/04/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I have no whey. They are big in karachi. They are good
01/04/2025, 5:21 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: do you know of macros?
01/04/2025, 5:22 pm - PF - Yahya Qureshi: Eager to try this out. Thanks!
01/04/2025, 5:23 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: The pot has calories written. Maybe if u go to the website it says protein also tho not sure <This message was edited>
01/04/2025, 5:23 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But u can ask them. They are quite responsive
01/04/2025, 5:27 pm - PF - Yahya Qureshi: Has anyone tried out Cal Ai for calorie tracking? Whenever I’ve tried to track calories with MyFitnessPal I usually I’m not able to keep up due to lack of consistency. 

I checked out Cal Ai today and it seems great. Take a picture and it breaks down the macros in the food for you. Highly convenient. Want to know if anyone else has tried it as well.
01/04/2025, 5:28 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I have just ordered online
01/04/2025, 5:28 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Hopefully they can deliver
01/04/2025, 5:30 pm - PF - Fatima Ahmad: Whey works same for men and women or quantity should vary?
01/04/2025, 5:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Not accurate at all though. 

Especially if you’re eating desi food. 

You can use it for a rough ball park but just know it’s not super accurate. 

For instance if I fry an egg without oil and if I use 2tbsp butter. It almost looks the same. 

AI can’t tell the difference in that case.
01/04/2025, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s the same. It’s just milk. Both men and women can have milk.
01/04/2025, 5:32 pm - PF - Fatima Ahmad: Its so simpler here to be honest, things were hard with whom I was trying to work on my diet.
01/04/2025, 5:43 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: <Media omitted>
Are products like these ok use to hit protein targets?
01/04/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup.
01/04/2025, 5:53 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Tried using it, got the subscription and everything but as soon as the subscription ended, it locked me out and didn’t recognize my subscription. Had to contact apple support to ask for a refund
01/04/2025, 5:54 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: I use MacroFactor. I like it better than MyFitnessPal tbh
01/04/2025, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They launched an AI too.
01/04/2025, 6:02 pm - PF - Yahya Qureshi: I see. I’ll get the yearly subscription anyways as it seems super convenient compared to alternatives. Naa track karne se behtar hai ballpark hi hojaye, atleast for the start 😆
01/04/2025, 6:02 pm - PF - Yahya Qureshi: Will check this out
01/04/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Yahya Qureshi: Right. I had rice, and a Qeema + vegetable curry. It counted it as vegetable curry but still included 15g of protein. It’s seems good for ballpark, not more than that.
01/04/2025, 6:06 pm - PF - Yahya Qureshi: <Media omitted>
How accurate or inaccurate are these macros? (Don’t judge the piece, Eid ke din online order karne se yehi mila 😂)

Skeptical about the 30g protein too, but curious to know actually Kitna hai. Weight must have been around 250g.

To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art 💕
01/04/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the chicken piece.
01/04/2025, 11:31 pm - PF - Amber Farooqui: Chest and a wing 🫤
01/04/2025, 11:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup.
01/04/2025, 11:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That didn’t look like 250. 250 ka tikka is pretty big. 

That’s more like 160-170g. Especially with that black hole lol. 

I’d say this is going to be 150g chicken thigh raw, so close to 30g protein. 

The app is pretty decent for such simple items. It’s curries and all where it’ll lose its accuracy. Stuff where there are multiple ingredients.
01/04/2025, 11:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search KFC breast 

It’ll be 370-380 calories.

Here you go. It’s from the Malaysian kfc website.
01/04/2025, 11:39 pm - PF - Amber Farooqui: So I'll keep 400kcal for single breast piece
01/04/2025, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use this.

02/04/2025, 3:32 am - PF - Asma Tariq: If you remember the numbers, then you can estimate from MFP. Like 2 walnuts, almonds etc etc. 

I do this way. It is helpful if I can't weigh.
02/04/2025, 4:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s a good estimate
02/04/2025, 4:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because otherwise it depends. Two people can have very different handfuls but honestly from 250-600 is a possibility
02/04/2025, 4:59 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: O wow, thats alot.

03/04/2025, 12:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Either have some thing like a Diet Coke and try to move on. Distract yourself. 

It’s not hunger. It’s usually boredom.

04/04/2025, 1:09 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: Oh ok. That's what I use if I'm making the food for like 3-4 people and then it's easy to calculate the macros that way as well.
04/04/2025, 1:10 am - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Yeah, I do that when I cook myself but when it’s made by someone else, it’s difficult to guess what and how much the base ingredients were to figure out serving sizes and stuff

Hi, @923441183411 can you please let me know the estimated guess calories in one "andrassa". I can imagine that it would be very high in calories. Any guess. Attaching the picture too.
04/04/2025, 7:40 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): must be about 300 calories in a normal andrassa
04/04/2025, 10:13 am - PF - Amber Farooqui: <Media omitted>
Is this correct?
04/04/2025, 11:51 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes tracking is fine
04/04/2025, 12:35 pm - PF - Amber Farooqui: Thank you
04/04/2025, 1:51 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: With oil? Because it's deep fried.
04/04/2025, 1:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes with oil 
without oil koe 150ish calories hon gi ek ma but it depends upon the size of amrassa too
04/04/2025, 1:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
This size? Any guess. 
Or should I weight and added as rice flour, jaggery, sesame seeds and desi ghee separately.
What do you suggest?
04/04/2025, 2:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You can do it but you wont be sure how much rice flour jaggery n all will be in 1 unless aap just 1 amrassa bnao khud n utni quantity ma ingredients add kro 
so its better to just go with a close estimate 300-325 calories for this size
04/04/2025, 2:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 325 done hai. 👍

04/04/2025, 2:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its all written on the nutrition facts at the back and you dont have to worry about sugar in 1 coke can if your overall nutrition is balanced 
but if it bothers you just switch it with a diet coke or any diet soda
04/04/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
04/04/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: At the behind of the can in tablespoon  they aren't written

07/04/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: Oh. Try fresh basket then as Mehrnaz suggested.🤞 <This message was edited>
07/04/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes, got it!! thank you girls
07/04/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But in this garmi it becomes super thick pretty fast
07/04/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: I tried the overnight oats recipe, but replaced the oats with a bar of weetabix. I swear it gave a cheese cake feel
07/04/2025, 10:48 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: That's a good idea. I've added like a tablespoon of biscoff spread to mine a few times and tastes so good. If you're craving something sweet in the morning.
07/04/2025, 10:51 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Sounds super delicious. Love it that it actually sounds like something naughty and unhealthy, but if the numbers fit your allowance- Go for it 👍
07/04/2025, 10:52 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Is there any other app that you guys are using to track calories apart from MFP
07/04/2025, 10:52 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: Yeah lol. As long as it's in your calories. My problem is that I'm always craving something to eat and it's so hard to not think about food all the time. 😭
07/04/2025, 10:55 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: I’m on week 1 at the moment, so i share what i have done to tame hunger pangs. Mostly mine come up in the evening. I’ve  started using sugar free squash or fizz and making it into a slush- it hits the spot. <This message was edited>

07/04/2025, 4:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): did u use K&Ns ka chicken keema ?
07/04/2025, 4:03 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: No, chicken shop se chest piece leke qeema banwaya <This message was edited>
07/04/2025, 4:04 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Then log as 200g chicken breast & oil too jitna use kia for cooking
07/04/2025, 4:21 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Thank you
07/04/2025, 5:00 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: Hi Coaches, I need some clarity on food tracking:
I weighed 800g of raw chicken qeema before cooking and added all ingredients accordingly. But after cooking, I noticed the weight changes.

So when tracking my intake (like logging how much I eat from the cooked dish), should I still track based on the raw weight, or do I need to recalculate based on the cooked weight?
07/04/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
One egg white has 17 calories and 3.5g Protein. Is it correct? I never had only egg white before so track nhe Kia Kabhi.
07/04/2025, 5:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can do both. 

Usually weighing it raw is more accurate but if food is made for everyone then can also base it on cooked weight. 

Generally chicken loses weight when cooked.
07/04/2025, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. It’s correct.
07/04/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/cooking/grams-tablespoons.php
07/04/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Is this accurate
07/04/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How many grams of biryani home cooked i can eat ?
07/04/2025, 5:30 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hello, can u guys recommend me some go-to chicken marinade?
07/04/2025, 5:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on calories.
07/04/2025, 5:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For what? Generally 1tbsp is 15g
07/04/2025, 5:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Shan Tikka masala lol
07/04/2025, 5:35 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: 🤪
07/04/2025, 5:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: For conversion <This message was edited>
07/04/2025, 5:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I had 10 to 11 chicken chunks of knn in lunch
I will share you the calories i logged
07/04/2025, 5:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Plz confrm if I did correctlt
07/04/2025, 5:38 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>
I had 10 ya 11 chunks only so I can calculate detict according to that right ? 
So 80 calories?
07/04/2025, 5:41 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>
I chose this one
07/04/2025, 5:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. If possible check the box for calories too
07/04/2025, 5:57 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
07/04/2025, 6:54 pm - PF - Fatima Shaukat: How do you track for shorba/curry? One plate
07/04/2025, 6:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. It’s mostly just oil.
07/04/2025, 6:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So if I’m have aloo gosht. You track aloo (grams), beef or chicken (grams) and then estimate oil depending on how oily the plate / curry looks
07/04/2025, 7:00 pm - PF - Fatima Shaukat: <Media omitted>
It’s 75g chicken 35g aloo and rest is curry
07/04/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe do 150g tomatoes and 4tsp oil.
07/04/2025, 7:29 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
120g mutton Qeema and matar

I estimated 60g cooked lamb Qeema and 60g peas cooked, 3 tsp oil. 

Is it fine? The oil quantity by looks.
07/04/2025, 7:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but that is 20-30 mutter at best. Not even close to 60.
07/04/2025, 7:35 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I thought nutter will have more weight.🤦‍♀️

First full working day after Eid holidays so 😴
07/04/2025, 7:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: But with 90g cooked lamb ground, I just hit my protein goal for today.
07/04/2025, 7:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha
07/04/2025, 8:19 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: <Media omitted>
How much calories would that be? One big dish spoon of rice, daal and fish fried in two tbl spoon olive oil
07/04/2025, 8:19 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Although i did check in the app, but a little confused
07/04/2025, 8:21 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: <Media omitted>

07/04/2025, 8:48 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Sameet said try to calculate everything separately in grams
07/04/2025, 8:50 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Oh okay, yea he always says that. So should I weigh cooked daal separately as this one was cooked for the family, i just took out a qtr bowl of daal out of it <This message was edited>
07/04/2025, 8:51 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Nope
07/04/2025, 8:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Next to the search bar, tap the barcode button and try scanning the barcode. Hopefully there will be a matching entry
07/04/2025, 8:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Ok thank you, will try
07/04/2025, 9:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not correct. You need to break it into grams. 

Did you not weigh it? 

If not then maybe try:

120g cooked fish (trout)
120g cooked white rice
60g cooked lentils 
3tsp oil
07/04/2025, 9:07 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Oh okay
07/04/2025, 9:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah so weigh your portions. You can always do that too.
07/04/2025, 9:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That or just go into create an entry and create this entry. 

But this won’t be accurate to begin with because they haven’t mentioned calories per gram. 

What is it and what brand is it?
07/04/2025, 9:11 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Weigh ur food then track it in app
07/04/2025, 9:25 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: This is Greek yogurt
07/04/2025, 9:26 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Blueberry flavored Greek yogurt from Emma’s Greek yogurt
07/04/2025, 9:26 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Quick question: aren’t they telling the calories per cup that is 150 grams in weight?
07/04/2025, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not necessarily. Depends on the cup and the product.
07/04/2025, 9:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe ask them
07/04/2025, 9:42 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay
07/04/2025, 10:02 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: So I think first thing first I have to get the weighing machine
07/04/2025, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely
07/04/2025, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll find many on Daraz.
07/04/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Thankyou, ordering right away.
07/04/2025, 10:34 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: One more question, did you calculated 120gms for one piece of fish?
07/04/2025, 10:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>

What's more important? Going over 100-200 calories to hit the protein goal or not hit the protein goal and stay within the calorie deficit?
08/04/2025, 11:18 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if it happens like on one random day that u r not able to hit protein target n not a daily pattern then its fine
but u r not hitting your protein targets on a daily basis then prioritize protein intake  and hit the daily target within your caloric budget.

08/04/2025, 11:43 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: With mutton
08/04/2025, 11:48 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bone marrow agar gravy ma mix hojaega then usko alag sy to track krna possible nhi hoga so we will track mutton n oil primarily because bone marrow bhi mainly fat e hota hai

Is it bad that almost 50 grams of my protein intake is from Fairlife milk and whey? I was told that it's better if it's like chicken or beef, eggs etc and I do eat that as well but like I just wanna confirm because my protein goal is 110g so almost 50 percent of it comes from this.

09/04/2025, 7:59 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: What could be the other reason if weight is stuck ? 
Despite eating in a calories deficit ?
09/04/2025, 7:59 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Bloating constipation  can be the issue ?
09/04/2025, 8:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well, firstly we need to see if you’re actually in a deficit.
09/04/2025, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can since it means there might be water retention.
09/04/2025, 8:28 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How to get rid of water retention
09/04/2025, 8:31 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Same question.
09/04/2025, 8:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Mostly patience.

It also depends on why you have water retention. 

Did you eat outside food or processed food with loads of salt? Are you close to your periods? Are you stressed? Are you sore? Are you sleeping enough? Are you dehydrated? Are you active? 

And a million other reasons.
09/04/2025, 8:37 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Luteal phase 💯 
Does PCOS issues can cause water retention at times?
09/04/2025, 8:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. 

Even digestion has a massive effect on it.

How to incorporate fiber in our diet
09/04/2025, 8:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. 

Things like fiber intake, sleep, hydration and stress can impact this. 

Are you eating atleast 15-20g of fiber?
09/04/2025, 8:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fiber comes mostly from your food, you should be eating loads of fiber rich foods especially when in a deficit. 

More fiber also means less hunger after meals.
09/04/2025, 8:51 pm - PF - Amber Farooqui: Just added fruits and salad in my diet
09/04/2025, 8:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>

09/04/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: if I eat chicken pulao, how do I enter in the app? because I will take 150 g rice and will intentionally take more chicken like around 120g

10/04/2025, 11:16 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: I've been watching videos trying to see if creatine is necessary or not. I read that it retains water in the muscle but people around me who go to the gym are saying why do you need creatine when you don't have enough muscles and I'm honestly confused. 😭
10/04/2025, 11:43 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Creatine has alot of benefits to offer 
its benefits arent just limited to muscles.
10/04/2025, 6:22 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Any brand and flavour which you people recommend for creatine. I have to order it.
10/04/2025, 6:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this
10/04/2025, 6:23 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: I want something like lemonade to fulfil my cravings
10/04/2025, 6:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u can make lemonade
10/04/2025, 6:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Guide, like?
creatine 
Lemon
Salt

10/04/2025, 6:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): creatine unflavored use krna if adding in lemonade
10/04/2025, 6:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): add lemon salt or stevia/candrel/sucral
10/04/2025, 6:27 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Okay, got it. simple lemonade, and add creatine un flavoured.
10/04/2025, 6:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 
flavored creatine ka to apna taste hoga
10/04/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly. I will go for flavoured one.
10/04/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Your code also goes with Alpha Nutrition. Right?
10/04/2025, 6:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): at Alpha Nutrition creatine is available in 3 flavores
10/04/2025, 6:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes if does if there isnt any sale on the store
10/04/2025, 6:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: With watermelon flavour, we can add a bit salt or lemon, few drops. It will taste good, I think. Or it's not good or recommended to add these things with flavoured creatine? 

Random though! <This message was edited>
10/04/2025, 6:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): add krny ma masla nhi hai but i'm not sure taste kesa hoga but sour watermelon itself is a good flavour
10/04/2025, 6:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): so try at your own risk
10/04/2025, 6:34 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Done!

I made these. The entire mixture was 967 calories. Each kabab is 65g. How do i calculate the calories of each kabab
The math is killing me
10/04/2025, 7:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Total grams of mixture?
10/04/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: It was 1144 something
10/04/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: The cooked mixture. Like the potatoes were boiled
10/04/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: But i measured them raw
10/04/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many kebabs are there?
10/04/2025, 7:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Track them boiled <This message was edited>
10/04/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 967/total number of kebabs made = calories for each.
10/04/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: 17 kababs
10/04/2025, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you made 18 kebabs 

It will be 967/18=53.722 calories per kebab.
10/04/2025, 7:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 967/17=56.882 per kebab
10/04/2025, 8:10 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: For lemonade, I take a beer mug and squeeze a whole 🍋, add water ice and sweetener and some salt @923134867945
10/04/2025, 8:11 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Seriously?? Itni kam hi hain?? Yaa I am missing something. I measure chicken and potato raw
10/04/2025, 8:11 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: No oil nothing just seasoning
10/04/2025, 8:11 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Add some mint leaves and throw the mixture into a blender to turn lemonade into lemon mint drink. So refreshing 😋
10/04/2025, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Phir this looks fine.
10/04/2025, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No oil? No egg?
10/04/2025, 8:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Try making Brazilian lemonade someday
10/04/2025, 8:13 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: <Media omitted>

10/04/2025, 8:19 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Ykw, that's a good idea. Any idea how I can keep the calories on the lower end? 🤔 @60193244266

Dark mocha frappe in this size 
How many calories
And caramel ice latte how many calories tell both
10/04/2025, 8:23 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Also how much is 12 Oz equals to how much ?
10/04/2025, 8:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search ground lamb. It’s going to more accurate and likely more calories than this.
10/04/2025, 8:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then should be good.
10/04/2025, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sweetener and maybe less quantity of milk.
10/04/2025, 8:26 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: .
10/04/2025, 8:26 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: <Media omitted>

10/04/2025, 8:31 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>
Are these calories and macros righr for hung curd?
10/04/2025, 8:35 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Wah 👌
10/04/2025, 8:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Just the Macros are skewed right? Calories seem reasonable tho
10/04/2025, 9:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hung curd is Greek yoghurt. Search full fat Greek yoghurt.
10/04/2025, 9:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sugar will likely be added to this.
10/04/2025, 9:21 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohh
10/04/2025, 9:26 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: <Media omitted>

10/04/2025, 10:13 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: <Media omitted>
Made the recipe as stated. Is the nutritional information correct. Seems so little for so much 🤔
10/04/2025, 10:13 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: <Media omitted>
10/04/2025, 10:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t you add things to this?
10/04/2025, 10:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Like oil and all
10/04/2025, 10:25 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Literally followed the recipe to a ‘T’. Yep there was a little oil to fry the chicken of and the remainder used for tarka 🤷
10/04/2025, 10:25 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: <Media omitted>
Is this ok for 155g of Chicken Thai Red curry from Fuscia?
10/04/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Apart from that just normal haleem garnishes- chili, ginger lemon

10/04/2025, 10:33 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: the chicken had garlic pepper sauce
10/04/2025, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah so chicken and oil ki calories will be on top of this. This just mentions calories in the masala
10/04/2025, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably not. It’s made in coconut milk so probably more calories and fat content.
10/04/2025, 10:44 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks Dude, had a bit of dumb dumb moment there. Will add the other bits and track it 👍
10/04/2025, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha no worries. We’ve all been there.
10/04/2025, 10:53 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ?
10/04/2025, 10:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rice 100g
Chicken 80g
Oil 3tsp
Cornflour 5g
Soy sauce 15g

What else is there
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: It does not have Cornflour, it has maida
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: <Media omitted>
Is this good?
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I can tell you the recipe of the whole thing if you want
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same calories. So doesn’t matter.
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Sauce was made up of soya sauce, maida, spices that included sugar also
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you know the recipe then didn’t you track it?
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Ok noted
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: No actually I was making for the whole family so couldn’t 🫣
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Add some sugar too then.
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You CAN weigh your portion. 

Weigh the rice you add to your plate. Track that. 

Weigh the chicken. So on. 

That’s a lot more accurate than guessing how much it will be.
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Just had 3 chicken grilled patties burger with fries (total  calories 903, protein 58gm). 😋

and only 82 calories are exceed than Deficit target for today. Heheheh. 💥 <This message was edited>
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: After cooking it.
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Amazing 🤩
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: you’re absolutely right, I do that everyday
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but I couldn’t right now
10/04/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay.
10/04/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: which is why I took the picture 😅
10/04/2025, 10:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then go with the numbers I’ve shared and just adjust based on the recipe.
10/04/2025, 10:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Add sugar and anything else I’ve missed.
10/04/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Okay thank you so much
10/04/2025, 10:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And if those are potatoes then those too. Oil for potatoes if they were fried.
10/04/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I made roasted potatoes in the oven
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but will definitely add oil
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Also one more question
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I am sorry for eating up your brain
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 150-200g of potato
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And 1-2tsp oil for those
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ask away
10/04/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: if a person has a passion for gym but he can’t afford protein powders or anything expensive like that
How can he acquire his protein requirement?
10/04/2025, 11:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): chicken eggs beef fish milk greek yogurt etc 
So many options
10/04/2025, 11:04 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: and also there are sooo many different kinds of supplements out there for ex mass gainer, BCAAS etc etc
10/04/2025, 11:04 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: what do you guys say about it
10/04/2025, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Most are useless. If you’ve got money get whey. Or creatine. That’s it.
10/04/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahah thank you
10/04/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I have both 😄
10/04/2025, 11:08 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Is there any difference in  cooked and un cooked egg or chicken calories?
10/04/2025, 11:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g raw chicken is around 70-75 cooked chicken
10/04/2025, 11:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 egg is 1 egg regardless but how you cook matters. If you fry it then oil say calories add hongi.
10/04/2025, 11:18 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: <Media omitted>
Keto bread and 2 eggs with mushrooms spinach 14g of mozrella cheese and milk and 1 tbsp oil
10/04/2025, 11:20 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Ok what if I make omlate, after cutting veggies tamato onions etc weighs separately all the things and then cook or need to weigh after cooking??
10/04/2025, 11:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just count the eggs. 

You don’t need to track the veggies.
10/04/2025, 11:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In an omelette you just track oil and number of eggs.
10/04/2025, 11:30 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Thanks and in case of grilled chicken and veggies
10/04/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: And how can we measure fiber in veggies?
10/04/2025, 11:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken and oil
10/04/2025, 11:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t need to measure fiber.
10/04/2025, 11:37 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: if i exceed my cals one day then can i take that amount less the next day? and same for fats?
10/04/2025, 11:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You could. You could also do that over 3-4 days. 

Like if you had 200 extra days reduce 50 calories for 4 days.
10/04/2025, 11:42 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: oooh yes makes sense
10/04/2025, 11:43 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: my protein goal is 106 g
10/04/2025, 11:43 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i ended up taking 126 🫣
10/04/2025, 11:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not a bad thing.
10/04/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes but i exceeded my calories and fats
10/04/2025, 11:47 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>
10/04/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: btw it’s been 4 days since i have been tracking my calories, going to the gym, eating balanced meals, taking creatine, and trying my best to walk around 4-6k steps (ik these are less but im trying my best to increase the number) and i feel so happy and proud of myself and super thankful to you guys!🤩
10/04/2025, 11:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And you definitely should be proud of that effort 🫶🏻

11/04/2025, 12:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Especially when you aren’t used to it
11/04/2025, 12:13 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: so like your body naturally adapts to it?
11/04/2025, 12:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, to an extent

1 small fries

11/04/2025, 6:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This works.
11/04/2025, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search KFC breast and KFC wing in the app. 

You’ll find entries.
11/04/2025, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: KFC small fries too.
11/04/2025, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Totally will be around 900ish.
11/04/2025, 6:46 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I got u previously  shared in group
11/04/2025, 6:46 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok can skip wing piece

11/04/2025, 9:41 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: <Media omitted>
Is this good for 215g of homemade chicken nihari?
11/04/2025, 9:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent. Did you not use oil?
11/04/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I added 1 tsp
11/04/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can be if 160g of it was chicken
11/04/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Add that too then
11/04/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: no I meant I logged it in the app🤦🏻‍♀️
11/04/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but I wasn’t sure abt this part
11/04/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you
11/04/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: I didn’t weigh the chicken separately. So that’s guesstimating
11/04/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then probably not accurate because 160g is a massive chicken serving.
11/04/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That would mean mostly chicken and 50g of gravy which is like 3-4tbsp of gravy
11/04/2025, 9:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So likely much less protein and much more oil and flour
11/04/2025, 9:50 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: It was quite runny, so quite a bit of water too
11/04/2025, 9:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or just more oil ahahaha
11/04/2025, 9:51 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Homemade, mom doesn’t use that much oil
11/04/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hi,

11/04/2025, 11:31 pm - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: Hii! How many calories are in one plate of zahid nihari? Or one full chicken biryani?

Couldn’t eat anything the entire day so all my calories are left except for one iced coffee with stevia i had this morning
11/04/2025, 11:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 96x0.75=72g
11/04/2025, 11:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Zahid Nihari probably 600-800 (more if you get the oil on top) 

And this is without the naan.
11/04/2025, 11:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken biryani depends on the size but a single plate won’t be more than 800-1000

11/04/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Sana Imran: How much would be brain masala ?
12/04/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Should be.
12/04/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 250g chicken breast or thigh
2tsp oil
12/04/2025, 12:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No clue since I’ve never had this. 

@923441183411 any idea? <This message was edited>
12/04/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Chicken breast
12/04/2025, 12:14 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): a single plate can be 250-350 calories depending upon how much oil is used 
100g beef brain is 140ish & 100g lamb brain is 125ish calories

Generally alot of oil is used in brain masala

I just checked. 50g laddu is 210 calories. 

65g will be 250-300 calories.

This is super high in protein. Would this be suitable?
12/04/2025, 1:54 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: I'm wondering what are the calories per serving?
12/04/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: <Media omitted>
12/04/2025, 2:04 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thats so much 🤷
12/04/2025, 2:05 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: Imo it's super high in calories and sugar. I guess we'll see what the coaches think.
12/04/2025, 2:06 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Thats actually the macros for 150g serving 
Most of the whey proteins come with a 30g scoop the biggest scoop i have seen is of Syntha-6 its i guess 45g
12/04/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: Woah lol. That's a huge serving
12/04/2025, 2:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its a 2kg jar which is 2000g & if you have 150g serving that means a total of 13-15 servings which doesnt make sense 
So i will never opt for this whey
12/04/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: I have tried legion, iso100, but ON tastes the best. I take two scoops of it. Around 240 calories with 48 grams of protein. Why don't you give one of those a try?
12/04/2025, 2:13 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Its from a health shop with a buy 1 get one half price sale on. Thank you so much, i think i’ll pass on this
12/04/2025, 2:14 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks i’ll give it a go. Do like the clear whey at the moment, but wanted to try something different.

12/04/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Look for whey protein rather than mass gainer. This one which I shared has got nearly 74 servings
12/04/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Amazing, thank you for that x
12/04/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: No worries. Just pick one that fits your budget and the flavor according to your taste

How to track this had few bites this is kunafa tart
12/04/2025, 7:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bro these may or may not be accurate. 150g of curry can be made with 0 oil or 5tsp of oil. This is why it’s better to break it into ingredients. 

Or share a picture of what you’re eating
12/04/2025, 7:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many are a few bites lol
12/04/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>

12/04/2025, 8:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can be 200-300 calories. Kunafa is high in calories. 

@923441183411  what say?
12/04/2025, 8:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Half the wrap won’t be 530. More like 300-350.
12/04/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank god
12/04/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Sana Imran: I think it has a biscuit layer then kunafa and pistachio cream and then chocolate ganache

13/04/2025, 12:15 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Go for proteine rich food at Dawat.
13/04/2025, 12:25 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Can’t go wrong with anything thats grilled or Bbq and curries that don’t look like they are swimming in a sea of oil. Avoid cream based salads or Alfredo sauces. Your good to go. Enjoy

Do we need to put each fruit separately in log?
13/04/2025, 8:31 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: Should we add desi ghee as 1tbsp when it was semi solid or liquid?
13/04/2025, 8:40 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes preferably, if you weighted the each fruit separately.

But if not, then you can track the total weight with high caloriec fruit in chat. <This message was edited>
13/04/2025, 11:56 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: How many calories would be in a chicken boti roll from bundoo khan? Can't find it the calories on their website or myfitness pal.
13/04/2025, 11:57 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just weigh it n log accordingly
13/04/2025, 11:58 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you can log separately thats great but if not then weigh the whole bowl and take an entry which has the most calories for the given weight
13/04/2025, 11:58 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: Semi solid desi ghee ko weigh karen
13/04/2025, 11:58 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: K liquid ko
13/04/2025, 11:58 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): can say without seeing because i have never seen or eaten it
13/04/2025, 11:59 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: It was like a paratha with 5-6 pieces of chicken breast bbq
13/04/2025, 12:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): doesnt matter weight to dono ka same hoga na bs solid ya semi solid thora compact hoga n will have some shape

80-90g roti
4-6tsp oil depending how oily it was

Which one would you go for - Protein shake has 224 kcal and 35 g of protein and the iced coffee has 100 kcals with 5.6 g of protein. Super hungry and need something on the go 😬
13/04/2025, 5:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably cooked 90-100g
13/04/2025, 5:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both 😂😂😂
13/04/2025, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But if I had to chose one I’d go for the protein shake. It’ll likely be more filling and helps you get to your protein target.
13/04/2025, 5:34 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks dude. I actually brought both with me. My kids wanted waffles and churros so rather then being antisocial and sabotaging my hard work, gonna sip my shake 😎
13/04/2025, 7:37 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes
13/04/2025, 7:37 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: beef qeema
13/04/2025, 7:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 60g cooked beef 80/20 
Half Naan 
25g chicken thigh cooked 
3tsp oil 
12-15g Mcdonalds fries

Is this the right log for this patty which is approximately 100 g uncooked
14/04/2025, 12:13 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks fine 
 it was mixed chicken mince or just breast or just leg/thigh meat ?
14/04/2025, 12:38 am - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: It’s a boneless chicken. I took 1 kg of chicken and added one medium onion, some green onions, fresh coriander, 3–4 green chilies, and a bit of other spices. I made chicken patties (approximately 100g per patty)
14/04/2025, 12:46 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): okay looks good 
also add oil if used any
14/04/2025, 12:55 am - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: Maybe one spoonso it should add separate in log ?
14/04/2025, 12:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): alag sy cooking ma use nhi kia to na krain add

14/04/2025, 3:05 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: 200 gm daal gosht (without boti) + 1 small home made roti would be how many calories roughly?
14/04/2025, 3:06 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: also if calorie deficit is 1220, how do i divide this between meals + dessert / chai (twice)
14/04/2025, 3:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If there is no boti then its all daal 
so track as 200g cooked lentils 2tsp oil 
Small roti probably 50-60g so log accordingly
14/04/2025, 3:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can divide as per your preference 
If you want all the meals to be eqaal then 400ish calories per meal 
If you like having 2 big meals and a snack then 500ish in each meal n 200-250ish as snack 
Or you can do it any way you like or prefer there is no hard n fast rule for it
14/04/2025, 3:37 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Okay so im confused 
I did 100 gram cooked daal
50 grams boti
100 g boiled white rice 

Are all daals same in terms of calories? There are different kinds of daals
14/04/2025, 3:37 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Or do i just track lentils, cooked?
14/04/2025, 3:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): All the daals have more or less same calories
14/04/2025, 3:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): so track as lentils cooked
14/04/2025, 4:29 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>

15/04/2025, 7:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: @60193244266 I genuinely wanna ask one thing that  everything in moderation is good enough, so why do you not put oil at all in your fatafat meals?
15/04/2025, 7:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because it doesn’t add any value for me. I can eat something else on those calories.
15/04/2025, 7:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: oh got it !!
15/04/2025, 7:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I add oil to 3 meals. Even if it’s a tsp each. That’s almost 150 calories. 

I can have almost 2 extra roti with dinner

15/04/2025, 8:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha

16/04/2025, 3:36 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I wanna know if there are things you don’t like at all which is why they’re not in your diet is it okay or should you add them in your diet for example hummus
16/04/2025, 3:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no it doesnt work like that

16/04/2025, 3:47 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I don’t like eating eggs so if I try different recipes that will make the egg taste go away, that’ll be great
16/04/2025, 3:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: so I see a lot of recipes for egg made with chili oil
16/04/2025, 3:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: secondly is there any difference between eggs and desi eggs?
16/04/2025, 3:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no there isnt any significant difference

16/04/2025, 6:25 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Also, 441 calories would be for 100 GMs per serving? Right
16/04/2025, 6:47 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: 4.4 * 13 = 57.2

16/04/2025, 7:20 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: I don't think tinday will have any calories. More like a fibre but would love to hear coaches advise on this. Summers mein these foods are common in every house hold
16/04/2025, 7:21 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Ah 441 = 4.4 , understood the math 🥶

16/04/2025, 7:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah just beef, aloo and oil for that.

16/04/2025, 8:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can reduce calories if you reduce papdi and dahi baray.
16/04/2025, 8:49 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: No baras in this
16/04/2025, 8:50 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: And 30gm papri
16/04/2025, 8:50 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Not much channa also
16/04/2025, 8:50 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Just some phulkis, and sev
16/04/2025, 8:51 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Yogurt and imli
16/04/2025, 8:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Phulki and fried so high in calories. Same as a bara. 

Sev is pretty high in calories too.
16/04/2025, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And 30g papdi is like 150 calories.
16/04/2025, 8:54 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Well, fudge
16/04/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: There must be a way making a healthy street like channa chaat💬 

What about using potatoes thinly cut and then air-fried instead of sev  and hashbrown type mix for the bara 🤔
16/04/2025, 9:05 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you coach☺️
16/04/2025, 9:06 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Papdi was a surprise for me too
16/04/2025, 9:07 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: i think dry channa chaat is the way to go to save calories with just pyaz, imli, dhaniya, zeera, chickpeas and tomatoes and boiled potatoes mixed up. Air fried roti for crunch lmao 😂
16/04/2025, 9:07 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 15g papdi is a lot btw

16/04/2025, 9:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can add yoghurt too. Doesn’t need to be dry. Just remove the fried elements and it becomes a pretty well balanced option.
16/04/2025, 9:24 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: This looks like the way forward
16/04/2025, 10:21 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Hahahahahahaha

17/04/2025, 4:17 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: in desi households, the salans cooked are mostly low in protein and it gets difficult to chase after protein macros if you do not have time or energy to prepare your own food and be mindful and calculated of macros while preparing it. How does one go about this? @923343773307 @60193244266 <This message was edited>

21/04/2025, 6:15 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Healthy?
21/04/2025, 6:16 pm - PF - Eisha Nadeem: For example if i search biryani on one app its 292 cal and other is 253cal so i,m really confused
21/04/2025, 6:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1200 calorie intake hai ye deficit?
21/04/2025, 6:33 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Intake for weightloss
21/04/2025, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. That’s not how you track calories. 

You need to break it down into ingredients. 

How does the app know biryani main kitni calories hain? 

Everyone makes it differently. 

For example: 2 people can both have 200g of biryani but one has 140g chicken in that and the other just took all rice. 

You think calories will be the same? 

Also oil content will play a big role. 

This is why you track ingredients not the name of the dish. 

The 253 or 292 are both wrong and it’s very likely that you’re having 600 calories.
21/04/2025, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Focus on overall quality of food and SLEEP.
21/04/2025, 6:34 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: ok

23/04/2025, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 eggs would be 140 calories. Not 79.
23/04/2025, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also you’ve likely skipped oil in each meal

enter as cooked lentils instead searching for specific daal + the amount of oil in it

Couldn't found that what's wrong with me
24/04/2025, 1:07 am - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Is it due to low calories, etc?
24/04/2025, 2:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It absolutely can be. If you’ve barely eaten then energy levels will take a hit.
24/04/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: @60193244266 I also wanted to ask something but related to the training program, I try my best to train till failure so should I just write 10 in the RPE row for each exercise as I literally can not do any further rep
24/04/2025, 2:45 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: Exact tracking k baad bhi weight loss na ho raha ho to kia karen? 1200 calories fully tracked. No exercise except 3-4k steps daily
24/04/2025, 3:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
24/04/2025, 3:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1. Share your tracking and respective food pictures so we can see if you’re tracking weight correctly
2. ⁠Share how you’re tracking your weight and if you have data share that 
3. ⁠increase daily steps

24/04/2025, 11:41 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: another question, when would I know that I have to increase the weight? as the reps are already being increased
24/04/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: for example i just did 12 reps of leg curl with 26.5 kg weight and i could do 12 reps properly and i felt as if i could still do more in one set
24/04/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: so should i increase weight when such thing happens?
24/04/2025, 11:53 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: and it’s quite crazy that the same weight in leg extension kills me 🥵

This is roughly 100g cooked mutton
24/04/2025, 1:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is absolutely not accurate. 

With mutton, you have to use lamb. 
Mutton isn’t a word used globally.
24/04/2025, 1:05 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok
24/04/2025, 4:50 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: <Media omitted>
Is it correct ??
24/04/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. But don’t search basmati rice. 

Just search cooked rice. 

Also don’t search for 100g, you edit that later.
24/04/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: I didn’t search for basmati

Just a suggestion as this made a big difference for me in maintaining my deficit.

28/04/2025, 6:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: It depends. The first time I tried, it didn't taste as good

But later I developed taste for it
28/04/2025, 6:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I’m a fan of this. Tastes better than plain protein shake.
28/04/2025, 6:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus you can add fruits.

28/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yes true feeling guilty now 🥲
28/04/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Always try to preplan your meals rather than eating and trying trying to figure out what you’ve had. 

Anything that’s high in cream, cheese and other sources of fat will always be high in calories. 

Especially when it’s also high in carbs (pasta)
28/04/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: ✅️ ok

30/04/2025, 4:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: You don’t want to undereat (very low calories and protein) while also training, that can put you at risk of losing muscle mass along with fat.

01/05/2025, 9:30 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: Is it okay if I eat below my daily calorie requirement, or can it cause problems?
01/05/2025, 9:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it's just occasionally, eating below your daily calorie requirement is usually fine. But consistently undereating can disrupt key hormones like leptin, ghrelin, and thyroid hormones, which regulate hunger, metabolism, and energy levels. Over time, it can lead to muscle loss, lack of energy, fatigue, brai nfog, nutrient deficiencies, menstrual irregularities (in women), poor recovery, and increased risk of binge eating and increased cravings
01/05/2025, 9:33 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: Do I always need to weigh my food before cooking to track calories accurately? And if I can’t do that, what’s the best way to track my calories?
01/05/2025, 9:33 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: ok got it :)
01/05/2025, 9:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you can't weigh your food, the best bet is to guesstimate portions, track what you think it would weigh, and move on. Weighing is more accurate, esp. for calorie-dense foods, but one meal that’s not tracked perfectly won’t hurt your progress

Seem okay? ~ CALORIES 
One small scoop for each. 

Both entries are with green tick. 

I estimated one scoop as 75 grams.
02/05/2025, 9:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Generally one scoop 1 is 220-250 calories
02/05/2025, 9:22 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Can you pls tell me how much weight in one scoop?
02/05/2025, 9:36 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I had one cup of banana shake but it was not made in home

03/05/2025, 1:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t use this app to track exercise. It’ll add calories to your day.
03/05/2025, 1:20 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What all is this? I’m going to guess 600-700.
03/05/2025, 1:20 am - PF - Rafiya Saeed Afridi: Yeah i dont count that exercise calories

You'll have to figure it out.
04/05/2025, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Put it in the app
04/05/2025, 7:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: Should be around 25ish kcal

04/05/2025, 7:16 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: So aloo becomes danger with oil🤔
04/05/2025, 7:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Too much oil in any food will increase its calories
04/05/2025, 7:17 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Yes.but aloo aj salun bad kha hi lia.😎
04/05/2025, 7:18 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: After 5 years eaten aloo in a salan
04/05/2025, 7:18 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Some nutritionist told me daal aur aloo ni khane.Similarly banana, mango and grapes b ni khane.
04/05/2025, 7:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yay
04/05/2025, 7:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
04/05/2025, 7:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: I wonder why this discrimination
04/05/2025, 7:19 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: So how can we track oil in french toast if not deep frying it but saute frying it?
04/05/2025, 7:20 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: She gave a chart aur usmai ye fit ni hu rhe thay.
04/05/2025, 7:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track however much you're adding in it to sautee it
04/05/2025, 7:21 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.Baki egg and stevia ya sugar ka to ulug add hoga
04/05/2025, 7:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: She's not 'fit' to give anyone a nutritional advice
04/05/2025, 7:21 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Hmmm
04/05/2025, 7:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it’s always better to track anything that contains calories, esp those that can significantly add to your total intake without you realizing it
04/05/2025, 7:30 pm - PF - Rafiya Saeed Afridi: <Media omitted>
Stupid question 🙋 
Its fine to have 1 glass of jam e shirin 
I dnt know i do have craving for it 
I track it nd its 25 ml have this much calories 


My gym instructor say no
Its not good in diet
04/05/2025, 7:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, you can have it!! :)
04/05/2025, 7:32 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Justice for alooo
04/05/2025, 7:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can literally eat anything as long as you’re staying within your calorie targets and hitting your protein goals. The only foods you should probably avoid are the ones you’re allergic to or have sensitivities to!!
04/05/2025, 7:38 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Anyone got any tips on how to stay on track at a sushi bar- what to eat and what to avoid. Eating out is fun, but wanna stay on track. Alergic to prawns and no meat as not Halal where i’m going 😬
04/05/2025, 7:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: A fellow sushi lover with a shellfish allergy here lol! 
The key is to focus on simpler, less processed options. I go for sashimi (just fish, no rice), veggie or avocado rolls, cucumber maki, or tamago (sweet egg omelet) for lean protein and lighter calories. Nigiri is also okay in moderation. Just keep an eye on the rice portions. Starters like miso soup, edamame, and seaweed salad are great choices too. Try to avoid tempura, fried rolls, or anything loaded with mayo or cream cheese, as they add unnecessary fats and calories (you can still have it but they can pack tons of calories very quickly). 
And if you’re tracking, sip water between bites, use low-sodium soy sauce or lemon for flavor,

p.s. When I have sushi nights, I don't track calories much so I can enjoy it fully!! :)
04/05/2025, 7:44 pm - PF - Rafiya Saeed Afridi: If they hve noodles 🍜 veggie noodles

About today
04/05/2025, 8:36 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thank you for that, i will take your tips on the sushi rolls. Love tuna and  salmon sashimi. I did have deep fried squid on the brain, but will avoid to save on calories and look at other stuff. I love siracha mayo, but will use a wasabi sauce they have thats not cream based. 
They have a mocktail menu, but i know there packed of sugar. Will stick to Diet soda or sparkling water ❤️
Point to be noted- You can still eat out and be within your macros ✌️

05/05/2025, 9:17 am - PF - Areesha Khan: Asalam Alikum I’ve lost 1 kg in the past week. I wanted to ask is this a healthy rate of weight loss, or is it considered slow? Also, is there anything I can do to safely speed up the progress while staying on track? <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 9:24 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: I think 1kg/2lbs  per week weight loss is very good and healthy
05/05/2025, 9:26 am - PF - Areesha Khan: Also, do I need to change my maintenance calories now, or should I keep them the same for now?
05/05/2025, 9:28 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): There is no need to change anything as long as you are getting results 
losing 0.5-1% of your current weight per week is absolutely fine and good progress.
05/05/2025, 9:29 am - Taha Ahmed: You might’ve eaten more salty foods or carbs, which could’ve caused your weight to go up due to increased water retention from those foods 

This fluctuation is normal and nothing to be worried about. It's not fat gain! :) <This message was edited>

05/05/2025, 6:30 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: <Media omitted>
05/05/2025, 6:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 60-65 calories
05/05/2025, 6:59 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: If we take chai with toast then should I count the calories of chai ?
05/05/2025, 6:59 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Chai peeti nhi hoon bs toast ko dip krne keliye
05/05/2025, 7:04 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I take chai with 1.5 TSP of everyday powder. Do I need to track it's calories? If so, how many calories in 1.5 TSP of everyday powder
05/05/2025, 7:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if its a cup then ofcourse
05/05/2025, 7:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1.5tsp is like 7-8g so log 7-8g everyday powder milk
05/05/2025, 7:06 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: How many calories in 7-8g ?
05/05/2025, 7:07 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: And if not a cup ?
05/05/2025, 7:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): log in the calorie tracking app
05/05/2025, 7:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): track jitni quantity hain because calories hon gi
05/05/2025, 7:09 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Okayy
05/05/2025, 7:10 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: So basically it's similar to a cup of tea with milk or a cup of tea using everyday powder 
It's btw 46-50 calories per cup
Am I correct?
05/05/2025, 7:11 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: In 1 packet
05/05/2025, 7:11 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Obv. 2 buscuits
05/05/2025, 7:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Powdered milk is more calorie-dense in its dry form, but per cup of tea, if used modestly, the difference isn't drasti <This message was edited>
05/05/2025, 7:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Powdered milk also has added sugar in it
05/05/2025, 7:12 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: ?
05/05/2025, 7:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: Since 100g of the biscuits has 504 calories, *a 12g pack will have around 60 calories*-  just multiply the weight by 5.04 to get an estimate.
05/05/2025, 7:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: It says net weight ~11.8g
05/05/2025, 7:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it's got 4 biscuits, then that's the net weight of 4
2 will be 6gm and half the kcal (60/2 = 30 kcal)
05/05/2025, 7:22 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: It has 2 only

05/05/2025, 7:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Could be less if it's got more khoya than ghee :p

As today is Day 1 of me tracking - I’d like to know if my logging is on the right track.
And since I’m supposed to consume 1200 calories in a day, I’m already over it. And still a little hungry 😅 any guidance would be appreciated
05/05/2025, 8:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally you want to use everything in grams. 

As for calories, don’t worry. It’ll take you some time to adjust to your new calories.
05/05/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Ahh got it. Will need to start measuring what I’m consuming as I don’t cook myself.
05/05/2025, 9:05 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Made Kung pao chicken 300 g chicken 
Veggies 110g
Peanuts 20g
1 tbsp Soysauce
Chili sauce 4tbsp
Sugar 1tsp
5-6 tbsp Oil used for total cooking 
This makes 2 servings. How to calculate calories with all these ingredients?
05/05/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Should I just enter these ingredients directly??
05/05/2025, 9:09 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: <Media omitted>
05/05/2025, 9:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can either log everything separately in the diary, or create a recipe (2 servings) and just track 1 serving in the app. It's much easier that way and you can reuse it later without having to enter each ingredient again. <This message was edited>

Iced mocha cinnabon 16oz has 210 calories so many then in 12oz
06/05/2025, 11:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: It can easily have over 300 calories
Cinnabon tends to go heavy on the chocolate syrup unless you specifically ask them to go easy on it
06/05/2025, 11:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Was it too sweet or moderately sweet?
If too sweet, then track ~300 kcal

07/05/2025, 3:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, we’ve all got a lot going on in our lives, but even then, we try our best to respond to everyone as promptly as we can. Like Ali said, it happens to all of us humans.

If you're ever feeling overlooked, it’s totally okay to just drop a polite message like, “Hey, can I get a response too?”

You’ve seen how crowded and busy it can get sometimes, yet we’re still doing our best - so a little understanding from your side would be appreciated too. Thanks!

P.S. Also, a general request to everyone. Please always add full context to your messages (in a single message), so it’s easier for us to respond without having to go back and forth. 🙏🏽 <This message was edited>

All you coaches are doing an amazing job to keep us on track and even answering questions like “ how many calories in water “. I’m new to the community, but lets use the optimum word of “community” as “Family” 🙏💕
07/05/2025, 3:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you sharing your feelings openly. We're genuinely here to support you, and we do our best to respond promptly, -  but yes, sometimes things slip through the cracks, especially with how busy the group gets.

There are times when we respond immediately, and others when, due to workload or mental fatigue, we unintentionally miss a message - and for that, I’m sorry. Even now, I have several pending posts to get through, and I’m pacing myself so I can respond meaningfully, not just mechanically.

That said, if you ever feel overlooked, a gentle nudge in the group or a quick private message to me or Sameet is always welcome. We’d never ignore anyone on purpose. Thanks again for your patience and understanding- it really means a lot!!! 🙏🏽
07/05/2025, 4:01 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Thank you for understanding, and I really appreciate your honesty and the support you're offering. I want to clarify that I'm not complaining at all—I just genuinely seek knowledgeable guidance and appreciate the efforts you and Sameet put into the group. I completely understand how overwhelming things can get, and I never want to add pressure. I’ll definitely reach out privately if I ever feel overlooked. Your openness and patience mean a lot—thank you again! 🙏🏽

09/05/2025, 3:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: Do what Ali said and you'll have more accurate calories and macros

But to me, it looks like a standard 5-6in waffle, could easily have ~250-350 kcals
09/05/2025, 3:58 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Thank you so much,you saved me, know the measurements but don't know how many waffles we made from it

09/05/2025, 6:16 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: How can I track paye and chicken handi?

Lets say 5 tbsp each of paye shorba and chicken handi similar
09/05/2025, 6:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): track shorba as 2tsp oil
chicken handi 5tbsp will be like 60ish grams chicken and 1.5tsp oil
09/05/2025, 7:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2kgs in 3 weeks is not slow at all. 

In fact I’d say it’s slightly faster than what most people would see. Especially with PCOS.
09/05/2025, 8:01 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: so i need to do some changes or no ?
09/05/2025, 8:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No there is no need to change anything because its working perfectly for you !!

Never had it before- what is Quark? Are there any benefits apart from having 25g of protein in a pot
10/05/2025, 1:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s Greek yoghurt. So protein and a lot of other nutrients like prebiotics and all.
10/05/2025, 1:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Quark is similar to Greek yoghurt but is technically a cheese.
10/05/2025, 1:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Still the same benefits.
10/05/2025, 1:39 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks Sameet. Its just come in my online food shop as a substitute for pudding. Better be nice as i have 10 sitting in my fridge ☺️

Because of all this mess going on, stress levels or emotional exhaustion. 
I'm having terrible food cravings. Like hungry since ages. 

Trying hard to be on maintenance calories these days. 👀😢

11/05/2025, 5:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 53 calories
11/05/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok
11/05/2025, 6:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: We all did this because we went in our survival mode. And now while I know it’s sort of over, but the trauma- and its effects- will linger for a while. That’s where awareness and consciously making informed choices come in. Whenever you feel like you're slipping, remind yourself to get back up. No one else can do it for you... only you can.
11/05/2025, 6:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: *Tip:* For ease, check the net weight instead of weighing it- it's mentioned next to the price in black ink
11/05/2025, 6:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Thanks, Taha, for the reply. 🙂

I really want to thank you all (the coaches and this incredible Fomo community). 🌸 
I've had some tough cravings over the past few days and I know I didn’t hit my targets properly. I was on maintenance calories or more.

But most of the time, my food choices were intentional. I ate a lot, but I focused on nutrient-dense foods.

I just hope this phase passes peacefully. ✨🤲 <This message was edited>
11/05/2025, 9:57 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How to track kichri
11/05/2025, 10:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Rice and cooked lentils only

This is how I track 100g of khichri (not dry)
1. 30g boiled rice
2. 30g cooked lentils
3. 2tsp oil <This message was edited>
11/05/2025, 10:06 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
11/05/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Would request some guidance to track my hotpot meal 🥲
I had broth, beef dumplings, beef and peanuts with noodles. But no idea how to measure how much
12/05/2025, 1:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any chance you took a picture of your serving?
12/05/2025, 10:56 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Ah I should’ve, didn’t think of taking a photo 😭
12/05/2025, 11:08 am - Taha Ahmed: This makes it a bit tricky, but you can still share a picture from the internet, let us know the portion you had, and we’ll be able to guide you better
12/05/2025, 11:20 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Let me try and see if I can find something similar!
12/05/2025, 11:22 am - PF - Areesha Khan: I've a question why weight keeps fluctuating it gives me anxiety tbh
12/05/2025, 11:25 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: <Media omitted>
12/05/2025, 11:25 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: <Media omitted>
This was the bowl size - I had two portions of the instant noodles that filled half the bowl, 4 beef dumplings, 2 big spoonfuls of beef, peanuts and peanut dipping sauce (the entire bowl🙈)
12/05/2025, 11:25 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: <Media omitted>
Size of dumplings and bowl
12/05/2025, 11:30 am - Taha Ahmed: I totally get you- weight fluctuations can mess with your head  but please understand they're completely normal. When your body retains water it is responding to things like; change from salty food, hormones, stress, or sleep, digestion (if you haven’t pooped yet today, yup, that adds up too), inflammation (like if you worked out yesterday, your body holds water to recover), hormonal shifts, esp around your period

So even if you're doing everything “right,” the scale will still bounce up and down. ALWAYS. For me it's really my bank account too haha!! 👀😅 
What matters more is the trend over time, not the day-to-day!!
It would be really helpful if WE ALL start to think of the scale like checking the weather- one rainy day doesn’t mean climate change 😄 <This message was edited>
12/05/2025, 11:34 am - PF - Areesha Khan: Thankyou so much for this detailed response I'll read it daily 😆
12/05/2025, 11:34 am - PF - Areesha Khan: What do you suggest 
How often should I check my weight if I find myself second-guessing whether I’ve eaten more than I calculated, even though I’m tracking everything carefully? <This message was edited>
12/05/2025, 11:35 am - Taha Ahmed: Gotchu. Here's what a rough calorie estimate would look like:

1. Instant noodles ~350–450 kcal (could be more depending on how much oil there was)
2. Beef dumplings  ~160–200 kcal
3. Beef slices ~130–180 kcal
4. Peanuts ~100–150 kcal
5. Peanut dipping sauce ~200–300 kcal (depends on how much and how thick it was but it's safe to assume it's on the higher end)

So in my opinion, thte total estimate could easily be around ~950–1,350 kcal
12/05/2025, 11:40 am - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: <Media omitted>
Rough estimates of this machine chai? Didnt need to add sugar so it was already sweetened
12/05/2025, 11:40 am - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Probably everyday is used <This message was edited>
12/05/2025, 11:45 am - Taha Ahmed: I have a very different answer to this question.

How often you weigh yourself should depend on your mindset 

If the scale messes with your mood or creates doubt even when you’re doing your best, then weighing yourself once a week or even once every 2 weeks is totally enough. Just make sure it’s under similar conditions (same time of day, after waking up, before eating). For women, it helps to weigh around the same point in your cycle, for e.g., before the luteal phase starts.

If you're in a good headspace and want to get used to seeing the normal ups and downs, daily weigh-ins (logged weekly as an average) can actually desensitize you to fluctuations and help you focus on the trend- not the emotion of a single number. (The more data you have, the more clearly you’ll see the trend, and the less emotional weight for you to carry)

But if it’s causing second-guessing, maybe it’s not about checking more… maybe it’s about trusting more. 🤷‍♂ (Something for all of us to reflect on.!!)

P.S. I’m having a surprisingly introspective morning- love when that happens. ☺️
12/05/2025, 11:46 am - Taha Ahmed: around ~110-140kcal but could be more, like 140-160kcal <This message was edited>
12/05/2025, 11:48 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I use it everyday in the office & log 150 calories for it just to be safe
12/05/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: appreciate it, Taha. Thank you!
12/05/2025, 1:52 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How to lower down cortisol levels
12/05/2025, 2:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Better sleep, daily exercise, adequate nutrition, decreased caffeine intake, hydration, breathwork, mindfulness and meditation, etc.
12/05/2025, 2:31 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okay
12/05/2025, 2:32 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Sometimes after excersize I feel bloated  y is that so
12/05/2025, 2:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Could be dehydration, or eating too close to your workout
12/05/2025, 2:34 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Right ✅️ 
How much gap between the meal and the workout ?
12/05/2025, 2:36 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ~40-45min works well for majority 
but it varies from person to person & what are you eating as pre workout meal.
12/05/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Oh 40 45 mins ?
I thought 2 hours atleast
12/05/2025, 2:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you have something like a banana as pre workout you dont need 2 hours but if you are having for example 150g rice & 150g chicken you might need a longer time to digest.
So if it takes longer for you to digest meals then plan your pre workout meal accordingly
12/05/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okay
12/05/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Depends how i feel  after a meal <This message was edited>
12/05/2025, 3:01 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: <Media omitted>
How do you calculate this? The weight of tha packet as written on it is 14 GMs net weight
12/05/2025, 3:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'd multiply the total calories for 100gm i.e. 524 kcal by 0.14 (14g or 14% of 100g), this would give me the calories of this pack.

524 kcal x 0.14 = 73 kcal :)
12/05/2025, 3:05 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Okay got it
12/05/2025, 3:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Also, it shows you how many calories in a serving and how many servings in this pack
12/05/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: But 1.5 serving per 100 GMs?
12/05/2025, 3:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope. That's quantity per 100g, if you look below that:

It says 1 serving = 10g (80 calories)
1.5 serving = 15gm <This message was edited>
12/05/2025, 3:08 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Acha okay okay, its clear now
12/05/2025, 3:08 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Thanks Taha

12/05/2025, 5:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
6 K&Ns nuggets = 320 kcal + calories from oil. 
If they're deep fried, then you'll need to account for that much oil

https://kandns.pk/products/breadedselection/nuggets.html
12/05/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: I have question to ask..... i m taking she hard boiled eggs.... when i scan the qr code of thw box i have... it is showing 100 gm serving calories.. 
However i selected a regular from.the list.. it ia showing as per numbr of eggs
12/05/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: What to log
12/05/2025, 5:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Just search for "egg" and track it

If you make an omelet or fried eggs, then track eggs (however many) + oil
12/05/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: <Media omitted>
Like this?
12/05/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Na it is juat thw hard boiled eggs

But you can just search for eggs and track them. (it's the same since boiled eggs don't have any extra/additional calories coming in)

Made pulao biryani using Sameet's recipe
12/05/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Guys. Just a question 
There is no way to check calories other than some app. Can I just use food scale and search ?
13/05/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Apps are free
13/05/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Why not use them ?
13/05/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: What apps?
13/05/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: I only know about my fitness pal
13/05/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Macros first

13/05/2025, 12:02 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Okay I'm downloading it. 
Thank you so much
13/05/2025, 12:23 am - Taha Ahmed: We don't use these apps to get 100% accurate results. We use these apps to learn behaviors, our eating habits, nutritional values, macros and calories, which help us make informed decisions as we progress in our journey.
The goal isn't 100% accurate tracking.
The goal is awareness, understanding, and building long-term habits that align with our health and lifestyle goals.
Tracking is just a tool, not the final destination- and you can use any app of your liking, whether its MFP, or macrosfirst, or loseit, etc.

13/05/2025, 1:14 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: I made my own hummus today with 150g of chick peas- no oil or tahini. I’ve tracked it on MFP. Is it tracked differently as I haven’t technically used it  as a meal, but have snacked on it all day with carrots and radishes? Not adding raw veggies to MFP- is that still correct?
13/05/2025, 3:30 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: <Media omitted>
I was being shy asking this but since it was a topic of discussion, i wanted to ask since i am making a weight diary, when i weigh myself in AM, the weight is higher than the after morning tea and 🚽 trip. So which weight should i consider? Attaching pic for reference
13/05/2025, 8:48 am - Taha Ahmed: You can search for all major brands and find the calories and macros for their food items. For example, a KFC Crunch Burger has around 550–600 kcal.

Check out this link: https://kfc.com.my/nutrition-facts

As for Cornetto, it comes in different flavors, which is probably why the calorie count varies.
13/05/2025, 8:49 am - Taha Ahmed: If you used your own recipe to make hummus then only track whatever was used in it. No need to choose a generic hummus entry in the app.
And yes, it's correct!
13/05/2025, 8:52 am - Taha Ahmed: Always check your weight *after* your morning bathroom trip. It won't be 100% accurate all the time, but you'll get more consistent reading.

13/05/2025, 2:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): keep it simple

13/05/2025, 2:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): weight km ya zada hojata hai raw n cooked ma

@923441183411 
Plz reply
13/05/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): measure the amount of rice & chicken in your plate and then log both separately
13/05/2025, 7:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If your overall calories are not exceeding & you are hitting the protein goal then you dont have to worry if carbs exceed or fats exceed 
main goal should be staying within the daily caloric range and hitting protein target daily within your caloric range
13/05/2025, 7:21 pm - PF - Sabina Saeed: Okay that’s a relief thankyouu

250 ml?
13/05/2025, 8:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): around that but it would be better if you just measure in a kitchen scale
13/05/2025, 9:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1ml = 1.03g
13/05/2025, 9:29 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: <Media omitted>
13/05/2025, 9:29 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Not even half protein 🥲
13/05/2025, 9:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you make this biryani and added its recipe in the app? 
If yes, then this is good
13/05/2025, 9:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Carbs are super easy to go over on because they’re in so many tasty and convenient foods (bread, rice, snacks, etc.). Try bulking up your meals with more veggies and protein first? They’ll keep you full and naturally leave less room for carb-heavy stuff.
And don’t stress too much if carbs go slightly over sometimes- it happens! 
Like Ali said above, as long as your overall calories and protein are in check, you're doing great!!
13/05/2025, 9:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: It looks like a large serving- so prob around ~600-700kcal, esp cause it's got more syrups, cream nad toppings!!
13/05/2025, 9:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Search *'sample meal plan'* in the Facebook group to see what you'll need to hit your protein targets. I've shared a list of foods there that can help you meet your protein goals while staying within your calorie range
13/05/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Yes I made this biryani for everyone at home  And logged everything in  the app!
13/05/2025, 9:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good! I just think that protein content per serving would be a little lower than that
13/05/2025, 9:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1kg chicken legs will have total 180-190g / 9 servings = 20-21g and some protein from yogurt (and maybe rice)
total 25ish grams hoga I think
13/05/2025, 9:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: I am sorry I just went too deep in it. You don't have to worry this much about one meal!! 😅
13/05/2025, 9:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Enjoy your meal!
13/05/2025, 9:51 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Thanks!
13/05/2025, 9:52 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Actually I appreciate it! Bcz I haven't been able to match my protein goals for a week now! I'm struggling to achieve the goal

I used Olper's low-fat milk in place of water, 60 ml. Thora zayda ho gaya milk. 2.5 min microwaved. But the taste was so dry that I couldn't eat more than a half cake. 

@923441183411 

is it because of low-fat milk or milk quantity used? <This message was edited>

Thank you guys for this support, I'm feeling super encouraged to continue!
14/05/2025, 1:02 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: However, I've been tracking between 1200-1300 calories and I still feel hungry while going to bed - so have to figure that out
14/05/2025, 1:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you for sharing, Hamna. Lovely hearing that! How are you feeling about this change? 😊
Also, you can have a few more calories. I remember recommending around 1450–1500 per day, so if you're constantly feeling hungry at night, it's a sign your body may need a bit more, esp if you're moving around or working out.

Hunger isn’t a sign of weakness- it’s just feedback. Better to fuel yourself well and stay consistent, than go too low and burn out or start bingeing. You’re doing great, and the fact that you didn’t restrict foods like roti or attend dawats without guilt is a HUGE win already. 🙌🏽
14/05/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Yes you're right, you did recommend 1450-1500 calories, however I tried to see if I could work with a lesser calorie intake 😅
I shall increase it to 1500 and see how this week goes! Thank you for the help!
14/05/2025, 1:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it’s better not to go too low without a solid structure in place, otherwise, you’re bound to crash, and we definitely don’t want that! 😊
Take it easy and go one day at a time.
It’s a marathon, not a sprint, so don’t rush it by cutting too hard to see if you lose weight fast.
Just saying! 😄
14/05/2025, 1:33 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Hahaha you caught me! I shall do that now.🥲

17/05/2025, 9:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i hope u liked it
17/05/2025, 9:54 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: Couldnt achieve that protein goal since you ate 2 😂
17/05/2025, 9:55 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): chicken breast 160g
oil 3tsp because steak ma genrly zada use krty hain oil/butter/ghee
17/05/2025, 9:56 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): about 110-120g rice & 70-80g cooked lentils
18/05/2025, 5:52 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: <Media omitted>
18/05/2025, 5:52 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: It means ek kabab mai 100 calories,right ??
18/05/2025, 6:06 am - PF - Fabha Murtaza: I think it is for 2 pieces of kebab
18/05/2025, 6:07 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: @923441183411 what do you think
18/05/2025, 8:19 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 100 calories per 2 kababs
18/05/2025, 10:59 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Ideally the calories should have been mentioned by them under amount per serving section so it would have been clear but yes 100 cals per 2 kababs <This message was edited>
18/05/2025, 1:37 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: 250gm haleem mai kitni calories hongi ?

Kulfi with falooda from asre Shireen
18/05/2025, 1:40 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How many calories
18/05/2025, 1:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: 250g Haleem has:
atleast 150g cooked lentils
20-30gm meat (chicken/beef)
min 2-3tsp oil

So just log it as that and you'll get the calories
18/05/2025, 1:43 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: ?
18/05/2025, 1:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 350-400 easy or can be higher
18/05/2025, 1:44 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>
18/05/2025, 1:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: What about the rest of the weight? 🤔 I thought we calculate it as 70% cooked lentils and 30% protein used
18/05/2025, 1:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: The rest of it is just water
18/05/2025, 2:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay so estimated breakdown:

250g chicken breast = ~400 kcal
200-220g egg fried rice = ~380–420 kcal (depending on how oily it is)
80g oil = ~720 kcal (9 kcal per gram × 80g) - The chef said that's how much they use!!!! Yikes, I know. 🤢

That puts the total around 1,470–1,550 kcal 🫠💀

But… cafes usually overestimate oil usage or don’t actually use the full amount they say (or maybe the chef just said that casually). If we assume they used closer to 40g oil total (still generous), you'd be looking at more like 1,100–1,200 kcal.

I think I ate around 31975 calories that day! 😂
18/05/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
I have a question regarding consistency of the haleem. This is hyderabadi mutton haleem. Would the tracking be similar for this?
18/05/2025, 2:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looking at this, I’d honestly replace the water with oil hahaha 💀
But yep, the water amount is still accurate
lentils soak up a lot of it!
18/05/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
18/05/2025, 2:11 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Im glad my estimate was close enoughish 😂
18/05/2025, 2:12 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Btw how much estimated protein? I @923343773307
18/05/2025, 2:12 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: I’m going out today and I love Chinese food. I’ve decided to eat less tonight, but I’m feeling anxious about tracking and staying within limits. What can I do to control the damage 😂
18/05/2025, 2:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha it was easy 70-75+ grams of protein
18/05/2025, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: What's the occasion? Anything special happening?
18/05/2025, 2:38 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: <Media omitted>
Any ideas on how many calories?
18/05/2025, 2:39 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: The bag is around 50 grams and the website says 190 cals

18/05/2025, 2:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Does it not have any nutritional information on its bag?

18/05/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okay
18/05/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: No

18/05/2025, 2:47 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: friends outing nothing special 🤪😂
18/05/2025, 2:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good
18/05/2025, 2:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then go about your day as if it’s a normal day. Eat whatever you want- just prioritize high-protein foods first. Start with a light appetizer (soup?) so you don’t end up eating a lot of high-calorie stuff right away.

This way, you can still enjoy eating out with your friends without stressing about calories.

As for portions, don’t overthink it- just focus on enjoying your time with your friends. But if you’d still like some help tracking your food (because you really want to learn how to), feel free to share pictures with us on Facebook and we’ll help you estimate it.

Enjoy!! <This message was edited>
18/05/2025, 2:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oats aren’t a protein source. It’s a source of carbs.

18/05/2025, 7:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'd do it like this
1 paratha (80ish g)
chicken breast (50-60g)
oil 3-4tsp

if there are any sauces like garlic mayo then add atleast 1tbsp of that (that'd be ~90 kcal)
18/05/2025, 7:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup- more or less <This message was edited>
18/05/2025, 7:33 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you so much

18/05/2025, 7:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Paratha roll ki total calories btw are 500-600 usually. Garlic mayo roll will be higher.

18/05/2025, 8:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can use either one!

If it’s raw, just enter the exact amount you measure.

If it’s cooked, then multiply it by 1.35 to estimate the raw chicken weight.
18/05/2025, 8:49 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: <Media omitted>

19/05/2025, 2:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Totally fair question, but context really matters when it comes to updating your macros and calories. Responding to your questions on Facebook instead.

19/05/2025, 2:22 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Hey 👋. So I wanted to ask,  for  example  if I'm making a meal for everyone  at my house with tracking. How will I log macros per serving

19/05/2025, 6:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: It was okay tbh!
But I needed 180g of protein per day and acc to these plans, I needed to spend 170k/month

THAT'S SUPER EXPENSIVE!!
19/05/2025, 6:48 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Protein is the hardest macro to hit. Honestly.
19/05/2025, 6:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: If I am cooking then it's the easiest :)
19/05/2025, 6:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same. I do 170-180g daily.
19/05/2025, 6:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Food looks yummy. 

But yes indeed super expensive.

19/05/2025, 7:00 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Has meal prepping worked for you guys? Making 2-3 servings of macro counted food (esp protein) and having it for 2-3 days (there are some dishes that you can enjoy eating twice or thrice) 😂

That's all I need. Yummy meat. Boiled rice. Sauteed Veggies.
19/05/2025, 7:30 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: spicy 🥵

Hello guys! Need help tracking this pulao pls 🙏
20/05/2025, 5:38 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: is it true that cardio burns more calories? but those calories are immediately replaced by next meals
20/05/2025, 5:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Mutton - 40ish gram
Boiled rice - 120 gram
Oil - 2 tsp 

Next time, if possible, measure your food so it's easier for you to track!
20/05/2025, 5:40 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Do I measure while it’s raw or cooked?
20/05/2025, 5:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Better if it's raw, but you can track cooked food too!
You'll just have to mention it in the entries while tracking
20/05/2025, 5:48 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Got it, thank you!
20/05/2025, 5:56 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: can anyone confirm
20/05/2025, 6:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey! Just to clarify, cardio does burn calories, but it’s not necessarily “more” than other activities like strength training - it depends on intensity and duration. 
Also, calories burned during exercise don’t directly equal fat loss; fat loss happens when you maintain a calorie deficit over time. 
And yes, the calories you burn get replaced by the food you eat, which is why overall balance matters more than just one workout. 
Hope that helps!
20/05/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: I think fat is being burned during cardio
20/05/2025, 6:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, but fat burn (for energy) ≠ fat loss or weight loss (unless you're in a calorie deficit) <This message was edited>
20/05/2025, 6:10 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: That clears things up

20/05/2025, 6:41 pm - PF - Sabina Saeed: Hi coaches a quick question please, how do I boost my protein intake on a daily? Shall I consider adding a protein supplement?

The rest of my journey is going great I’m working out but really busy couldn’t interact much
I have lost 2 kgs in last 10 days but protein intake is 60 percent of my goal
20/05/2025, 6:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Post it on Facebook please so we can have a detailed discussion

Also, post your current food intake (a screenshot of your diary so we can see your good choices), how much protein you're having, what you're struggling with and why do you think that is? <This message was edited>
20/05/2025, 6:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: It looks like 120-150gm potato

And since it's deep fried, I'd add 4tsp oil

You can track it as "McDonald's fries large"

20/05/2025, 11:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: These are raw ingredients for 3 servings, right?
So when tracking, you only need to log what you actually consume - unless you're creating a full recipe in the app.
21/05/2025, 12:00 am - Taha Ahmed: That means you’ll divide everything by 3.
For example: 230g chicken ÷ 3 = ~76g per serving (I’m guessing that’s your portion).
21/05/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: This message was deleted
21/05/2025, 12:00 am - Taha Ahmed: This way you're only tracking what YOU ARE EATING, not what you're making for everyone as a whole
21/05/2025, 12:02 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: I made it for myself in advance 🤣, very difficult to make  daily
21/05/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: Now I got it thank you Coach @923343773307
21/05/2025, 12:04 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha makes sense! 😂
Now go ahead and track 1/3 of the portion right now.

When you have it again, you can just copy this meal into that day’s log - easy!

Doesnt look like a thick base so Track 70ish grams maida

22/05/2025, 4:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I thought it’s ketchup or something

If we measure chicken 450g with bone and then weigh the bone after eating the meat i.e. 110g
So what should we calculate? The meat only or the whole piece with bones? 🤔

Usually chicken tikka, street food (Leg n thigh) is 250-300g
Phir what did I eat? 
I hope I'm making some sense 😄 <This message was edited>
22/05/2025, 11:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Secondly if i am having lauki (bottle gourd) cooked and channay ki daal

it’s cooked together, but there was more channay ki daal so should i divide like 

190 g total 
130 g channay ki daal
& 60 g bottle gourd cooked?
22/05/2025, 11:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): log without bones & for leg/thigh calories protein macros are almost the same so either log as leg or thigh
22/05/2025, 11:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes that will work & the oil used in it will be logged too
23/05/2025, 12:12 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes i have added oil separately

24/05/2025, 6:20 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Not gonna lie looks yumm

24/05/2025, 3:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends but likely around 450ish
24/05/2025, 3:26 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: <Media omitted>
Overkill or ok?
24/05/2025, 3:31 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Does anybody know how to track cheezious Arabic rolls
24/05/2025, 3:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): breakdown the ingredients in it and add in the app individually
24/05/2025, 3:36 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 870 looks like an overkill 
but if i get to have a look at the sandwich i could tell better
24/05/2025, 3:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 870 includes a cold coffee so might not be that unrealistic. 

@923218282808 are you sure it had 2 eggs?
24/05/2025, 3:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): okay okay 
i didnt see the coffee i thought its just for the sandwich
24/05/2025, 3:55 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: No, not sure about the 2 eggs.
24/05/2025, 3:57 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: I doubt it though, considering it was in a bagel
24/05/2025, 4:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Change that to 1 egg.
24/05/2025, 4:29 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Ok

24/05/2025, 5:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe just search fried chicken chop

25/05/2025, 1:43 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Are there any health benefits from swapping from normal cows milk to a plant based i.e unsweetened almond milk ?
25/05/2025, 3:51 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Only if you have issues digesting lactose.
25/05/2025, 11:54 am - Taha Ahmed: Plant-based milks are generally low in calories (and also low in nutrients). So if you’re looking to enjoy a richer-flavored coffee, you can absolutely swap dairy with plant-based milk. Just keep in mind that you’ll be missing out on fats, protein, and other micronutrients found in dairy.

That said, if the rest of your diet is nutrient-dense, then you don’t need to worry too much about this part.
But yeah, no other such health benefits other than what Sameet said.
25/05/2025, 12:05 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks for that @923343773307. It was the calories that i was looking as its 40kals for 250ml. I can bloody make loads   Of coffee with that ☺️. The rest of my diet is not nutriant dense so will continue with dairy, but it seems like a great alternative base for iced coffees without being heavy on the calorie bank.
25/05/2025, 12:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: I totally agree! But yeah, the difference isn’t that much, tbh. You can go for plant-based milk and just make sure to add more protein, fruits, and veggies into your diet (for those extra micros and fiber too 😋). 
There’s always a workaround! 😇
25/05/2025, 12:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, if you’re concerned about calories then switch to low fat milk. You still get most of the benefits of dairy but at a lower calorie cost.
25/05/2025, 12:33 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thank you sameet. Dunno what it is with skimmed milk over here. Its as if i can taste the grass the cows have eaten. Its vile 🙈. Normal full fat milk is 135 for 200ml. Trust me when i say i use  it like a total “kanjoos” throughout the day.
25/05/2025, 12:37 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I use low fat milk and it has 107 cals per 250 ml. Quite happy with it since I hardly use the whole 250 ml
25/05/2025, 2:33 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: Asalamualaikum coaches! I’ve been in a calorie deficit for a while, but during my period I feel really low on energy and get strong cravings — my body keeps telling me to eat more. Is it okay if I eat slightly more during my period and then balance it out next week when I’m feeling better? Or should I try to stick to the deficit even during this time?"

29/05/2025, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: To avoid this confusion precisely. The calories we’ve shared have already activity levels accounted for in them.
29/05/2025, 5:15 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Ok so I was given 1670 calories in November so I should still stick to that or they will change according to the weight ?
29/05/2025, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They can eventually change but that’s usually after you’ve lost a considerable amount of weight or if your activity levels have dropped drastically
29/05/2025, 5:18 pm - PF - Sana Imran: So 6kgs down and 10k steps and 3 to 4 times per week I workout
29/05/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Is weight still moving downwards?
29/05/2025, 5:18 pm - PF - Sana Imran: No now it’s stuck
29/05/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: On average every 2 weeks or so.
29/05/2025, 5:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you recording it? Maybe share the numbers on Facebook. And I’ll let you know if we need to change it.
29/05/2025, 5:20 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Ok that would be great thank you Sameet.

Is this good for 1 club sandwich from Xanders? I removed the middle layer brea
29/05/2025, 7:12 pm - PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal): Yes
29/05/2025, 7:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks fine
you can search full fat milk
29/05/2025, 7:12 pm - PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal): Saudia company 
Almarai milk
29/05/2025, 7:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes looks fine
29/05/2025, 7:13 pm - PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal): Ok
29/05/2025, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. Can easily be 750ish too.
29/05/2025, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 12g of fat seems very unlikely given how sauce heavy it is.
29/05/2025, 7:31 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Should I just do 750 less 1 slice of bread?
29/05/2025, 7:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d just do 750. And the one less slice is a  bonus. You don’t need to account for it.
29/05/2025, 7:34 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Ok. 👍
29/05/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal): Alo gobi salan 50 gram 
How to measure this?
29/05/2025, 9:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Potato 25g
Cauliflower 25g
Oil 1.5tsp
29/05/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal): Ok
29/05/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal): Bohet kam oil mein salan banaya tha
29/05/2025, 9:11 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: If you cook yourself, you can measure oil. Even my less for salan is 1tbsp/4g average for per serving
29/05/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then add 1tsp
29/05/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1tbsp is 14g not 4g btw.
29/05/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: I think my spoon tbsp is smaller,. Because i measured it on scale. Tsp is 2g and tbsp is 4g
29/05/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s odd. Usually 3tsp is 1tbsp.
29/05/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It could be that your scale is not picking up the weight correctly.
29/05/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How are you weighing oil on a tsp
29/05/2025, 9:33 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: <Media omitted>

I think my spoons are small
29/05/2025, 9:43 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: Can you please see if i am doing it wrong
29/05/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A better way is to keep the bottle on the scale. Press tare. Pour out your quantity and put the bottle back on the scale.
29/05/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll tell you how much you used.
29/05/2025, 9:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Won’t have dirty tsps too hahaha
29/05/2025, 9:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah not a massive difference but probably a more accurate protein reading.
29/05/2025, 9:45 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: Okay iA next time

29/05/2025, 10:03 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: As for oil, the entire chicken had used 1/4 cup in the marinade, quite a bit was left on the cooking sheet. I only had 1 breast but still recorded 5 tsp
Is that good?

29/05/2025, 10:49 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: I used 1 tbsp for the patty! Will add it! Thank youuu

29/05/2025, 11:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can make the patties without oil. They’ll release their own fat so that’s one way to reduce calories.
29/05/2025, 11:42 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: I was really hungry, and I thought I’d get some extra protein in!

30/05/2025, 2:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: 80-90g rice, 2-3tsp sugar (i'd add 5-6 cause of gulab jamuns in it)

Ok?
30/05/2025, 2:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's not 60g of lamb, though it looks like you might be overestimating a bit to be safe
30/05/2025, 2:17 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Yeah, better to overestimate
30/05/2025, 2:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sure, but if you just want to overestimate calories, then increase the oil- not anything that has protein. 
Otherwise, subconsciously you'll end up reducing your protein intake too (because it'll show you've consumed more).

31/05/2025, 4:12 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: So I went out to dinner tonight with my husband. And boosted very proudly that I'll only eat proteins, and avoid as much extra fat I can! 
We ate brain masala!! 😋 
Little did I know that it had less proteins and was very high in fats 🫢🤦‍♀️ what a great learning curve it was! 
Ghar AA ker I tracked my calories n now I feel like a fool 😭 
I'm feeling heavy and bloated! Lug raha Hai I ate a whole camel
31/05/2025, 12:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Brain does have protein, but you're right, it's also got a lot of fat, haha! 😂
While raw brain is quite protein-dense, the way it's often prepared (like brain masala, which is typically loaded with oil) significantly bumps up the fat content and can dilute the protein percentage by weight in the final dish. 😬 That's likely why yours ended up being so high in fat and comparatively less protein!

But it's absolutely okay. You were out enjoying a good time with your husband, and that's what truly matters. One single meal, even if it was higher in calories and fat than you expected, won't undo your progress or negatively impact your long-term goals. I am sure the excitement of eating brain masala would've burned those excess cals 🫠 

Seriously, those 'excess' calories from one dinner out don't count in the grand scheme of things!
31/05/2025, 12:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus, the learning is a win. It may help you make better informed choices next time. 

And when you think of this journey as a marathon rather than a sprint, you’ll realize the importance of these learnings.

02/06/2025, 10:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sugar free has less sugar but calories are pretty much the same so usually one scoop of Baskin-Robbins is 220-290 calories depending on flavor.

03/06/2025, 1:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It varies on the brands too. For BR, this is accurate. Most are lower than what I mentioned. 

Each flavor has two weights mentioned, maybe double check what their scoop weight is 

I usually don’t eat BR though hahahaha

08/06/2025, 1:50 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: How to track calories of popcorn which are available at cinema theatres
08/06/2025, 2:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: > Salted Popcorn: Small/Regular: Around 300–600 calories
> Sweet (Caramel) Popcorn: Typically higher in calories due to added sugar and coatings:
> Small: Approximately 250–400 calorie & Large: Around 800–1,200 calories​

It really varies because different places have different serving sizes also!
08/06/2025, 2:19 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Nachos?
08/06/2025, 2:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha that's tricky!
If it's just plain nachos then that should have an entry in MFP or MF.
But if it's loaded with sauces and whatnot, then can't really say much, but close to 600-800 calories
08/06/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: So much calories in popcorn.... i wasted it all yesterday.. i feeel guilty now
08/06/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Plain nachos

08/06/2025, 2:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: It was just one day... one day out of 365 days! It's okay. Trust me!
It won't do anything to your progress!
Just improve your food choices today- focus more on high protein foods, fruits and vegetables, some nice carbs and fats and you're good! 😊
08/06/2025, 2:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: No!
A small serving of salted popcorn with an iced peach tea. The best combo!
08/06/2025, 2:25 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Wo b 200 calories hujiange

08/06/2025, 2:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No need to feel guilty because it’s just one day plus think of it as a learning opportunity. 

You’re now better equipped to make informed decisions.  

Also, understand there’s nothing wrong with having food whilst watching a movie but at the same time, if you’re there to enjoy a movie, there’s nothing wrong with just getting a diet drink and enjoying the movie.

I've lost 3 kgs and inches as well, and I’m happy with my progress  but in the last 5 days, my face has started to look puffy. This wasn’t an issue in the beginning, so I’m confused and a bit upset. Why does my face look puffy despite losing weight and inches? :(
12/06/2025, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be water retention because of sleep, stress, something you ate, your menstrual cycle or another million reasons. 

Water retention is temporary and eventually goes down.

12/06/2025, 4:30 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): a moderate deficit coupled with good training with progress overload adequate protein intake and good rest recovery will help you build muscle as well along with losing fat
12/06/2025, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Will get to this in a bit.
12/06/2025, 5:18 pm - PF - Asim Mahmood: What’s considered a moderate deficit? I’m usually in a 400–500 kcal deficit on average.
12/06/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Sana Imran: How many calories in Iced caramel latte?
12/06/2025, 5:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That should be fine. 

Did you get your calories calculated and verified?
12/06/2025, 5:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the serving and all. Did you order it from somewhere?
12/06/2025, 5:49 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Xanders ?
12/06/2025, 5:50 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Or black honey?
12/06/2025, 5:51 pm - PF - Sana Imran: Mfp has Costa iced caramel latte but it shows for 299ml 106 cal
12/06/2025, 5:51 pm - PF - Sana Imran: So not sure if it’s correct
12/06/2025, 5:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search Starbucks Venti Iced Caramel Latte.
12/06/2025, 5:55 pm - PF - Asim Mahmood: I usually calculate it with chatgpt. I’ve checked it against mfp, sometimes there’s more of a difference, but I still use gpt by providing more details.
12/06/2025, 5:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No no. I meant how many calories you’re supposed to eat and all. Did use use the community to sort that out.
12/06/2025, 5:59 pm - PF - Asim Mahmood: Yes, your calculator.
12/06/2025, 6:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And got it verified from the community too? If not share what the calculator gave you with some insight if your current weight and goals. 

Share it on Facebook. Not WhatsApp.
12/06/2025, 6:04 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: Hey . Have a question . Do you recommend a pre workout meal if you workout first thing in the morning which is usually an hour of strength followed by 20 min of steady state cardio . If yes can you give some options considering that I can only eat 1400 calories a day and usually not so hungry when I get up
12/06/2025, 6:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t have to. 

It might help performance though. Something as basic as a protein shake and a piece of fruit can work. 

But if you’re not struggling with performance then you don’t have to. And can just have proper post workout breakfast (with protein). 

Coffee or a pre workout (any caffeine) can help with performance too.
12/06/2025, 6:07 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: Ok great I do take a pre workout and an EAA during my workout too

12/06/2025, 6:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This isn’t accurate. It should be around 250ish
12/06/2025, 6:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to post on Facebook. There’s no pending post at the moment.
12/06/2025, 6:12 pm - PF - Eman Ali: I have. Got answers on everything just this verification is left I believe

Just do:
30g cooked lentils
15g cooked rice
15g cooked ground beef
1.5tsp oil
12/06/2025, 7:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No exercise targets fat. 

Exercise helps you build muscle in an area. 

Fat loss comes from your diet and your deficit.

12/06/2025, 11:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. 

Gosht will be 60g cooked ground beef or ground lamb (mutton)

And add oil, usually 3-4tsp.
12/06/2025, 11:39 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: For aaloo, just cooked potato is fine?
12/06/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: <Media omitted>

AOA everyone, I’m looking to bring some change to my diet, honestly getting tired of the usual chicken recipes.

Would it be a good idea to have 100g macaroni with 100g chicken (cooked together) once a day, especially post-workout?

I’ve added a picture for reference, though it doesn’t have the full 100g of chicken in it.
14/06/2025, 3:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it makes you feel good and you enjoy this meal then why not. It's got carbs and protein, and you're eating it post-workout, will help replenish glycogen and also help with recovery. I'd increase the chicken to 120-130g so you're getting atleast 40ish grams of protein in this meal.

And you know you can add spices and low calorie sauces to it to make it yummy, and more sauteed/stirfry veggies. <This message was edited>

Today I don’t have a question I’m just here to share my progress and a little bit of joy.

✨ I’ve lost 3.6 kgs in the last 49 days, and honestly… I’m just so happy.
Last year, I had lost hope. I felt like I was trying everything but the scale wouldn’t move. But this time, things changed and it’s not just the weight loss. I’ve lost inches too, and I can’t even put into words how amazing that feels. 💖

I’ve asked a lot of questions here (even some silly ones 😅), but all of you have helped me more than I can express. Special duas and thanks to @60193244266, @923343773307, and @923441183411  your support means everything.

And the best part?
I didn’t have to give up anything.
Just consistency, better choices, and trust in the process.

Grateful beyond words.
JazakAllah Khair 🌸
15/06/2025, 11:08 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Thats just amazing🎉

Do you guys do any exercises or practices for flexibility and longevity beyond weight training, such as stretching or mobility workouts or you just focus on weight training and daily step count?
15/06/2025, 11:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s amazing. Glad to hear you’re making progress on all fronts
15/06/2025, 11:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re lifting with full range of motion then your strength training is also going to improve flexibility
15/06/2025, 11:15 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok so no need to include any special excericise for flexibility or mobility.
From the past 4-5 months I am just doing weight training and completing 10k steps. That’s all
15/06/2025, 11:16 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes exactly, 
I added a movement for hip mobility as i used to experience alot of stiffness there full ROM k baad bhi but other than that nothing just proper warmup full ROM and progressive overload

Carbs and fats can be eaten as per preference within the caloric limits 

Weigh your foods on the kitchen scale & track n log all your meals.

15/06/2025, 11:03 pm - PF - Samia Najam: 650 really?
15/06/2025, 11:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah most of those things are either fried or loaded with cheese and cream.
15/06/2025, 11:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Looks good. No oil used?
15/06/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Samia Najam: yeah but its all i eat for today
15/06/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Farwa Raza: Just one spray of olive oil on both seprately
15/06/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i thought it must be 1000+ but 650 seems great❤️
15/06/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe add 3-4g oil then
15/06/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not a good way to manage nutrition cause you’re likely not getting any of the nutrients your body needs. 

It’s fine if it’s a one off but don’t let it become a usual thing.
15/06/2025, 11:08 pm - PF - Samia Najam: naah nah its not a usual routine, i ate 90gms of my protein along with all carbs etc you've added in my diet  ... its just for today cause we're planning to go out for a dinner ... thats why i didn't take anything before that ... <This message was edited>
15/06/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Samia Najam: can you recommend me a good protein powder .. the one having a good taste
15/06/2025, 11:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on what’s available. 

I used to get protein works in Pakistan. 

You can also check Alpha Nutrition (I think @923441183411 has a discount code for it)
15/06/2025, 11:15 pm - PF - Samia Najam: suggest me a good one i can source it from UK
15/06/2025, 11:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: MyProtein.
15/06/2025, 11:23 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: @60193244266 Is protein works  available in Pakistan ? Can’t seem to find the link
15/06/2025, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I think the website is called protein factory.
15/06/2025, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://theproteinfactory.pk/

15/06/2025, 11:27 pm - PF - Farwa Raza: I scaned the barcode
15/06/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Farwa Raza: <Media omitted>
15/06/2025, 11:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 169g has 251 calories
251/169=1.485 calories per gram 

16x1.485=23.76 calories.
15/06/2025, 11:33 pm - PF - Samia Najam: is it safe to buy there fat burner range ?
15/06/2025, 11:33 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i haven't take any kind of protein powder before
15/06/2025, 11:34 pm - PF - Samia Najam: <Media omitted>
15/06/2025, 11:35 pm - PF - Farwa Raza: Wow thanks
15/06/2025, 11:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Safe? Probably. 

Waste of money? Absolutely.
15/06/2025, 11:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just get basic protein powder. 

And if you want something else then go for creatine.
15/06/2025, 11:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can help with muscle, strength, brain health and more.
15/06/2025, 11:40 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I typed and erased my msg 😂
15/06/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: @923356063768 just drink some caffeine... Yahe hota hai fat burner main bhi 😂

15/06/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i thought it was something else 😅😅
15/06/2025, 11:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pretty much.
15/06/2025, 11:42 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: @60193244266 kia my during feeding coffee pee sakti ho....🥹

15/06/2025, 11:43 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yeah i just finish this one
15/06/2025, 11:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally no cause the caffeine can pass on. 

I’d consult your pediatrician for this.
15/06/2025, 11:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
15/06/2025, 11:45 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Pragnancy my mana kiya tha abi my ny nai pocha....🥲
Mjy literally ice coffee ki craving horhi hai
15/06/2025, 11:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can have decaf.
15/06/2025, 11:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Waisay it’s safe but I’d still consult your doctor. 

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends up to 200 mg of caffeine per day but it does pass on some caffeine to breast milk which is why I recommend you consult a doctor first. 

And if they allow it have it earlier in the day and maybe not too regularly.
15/06/2025, 11:50 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Inshallah i will
16/06/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 for beginners is whey protein sufficient for building muscle or should they also consider taking creatine?
16/06/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can help everyone. 

Also, whey protein doesn’t build muscle. Whey protein just helps you get to your protein target. it is any and all protein that helps build muscle. 

Whey main kuch special nahin.
16/06/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Which brand’s creatine do you use?
16/06/2025, 12:09 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i use Kevin Levrone's Gold Creatine
16/06/2025, 12:33 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I use rule1 currently. Previously was myprotein.

16/06/2025, 9:13 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u have macros written there for 1 slice ~60 calories 
so 2 will be 120
16/06/2025, 9:14 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 250ml kar lain
16/06/2025, 9:22 am - PF - Gulalai Anas: <Media omitted>
Fine?
16/06/2025, 9:24 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): the bread you showed has less calories than this 
the label says 60 per slice you can be abit at the safer end and log 70 for 1 slice so for 2 it will be 140 calories
16/06/2025, 9:25 am - PF - Gulalai Anas: Wo add hi nai horha
16/06/2025, 9:26 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u can simply adjust the serving size to make it 140 calories

16/06/2025, 2:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Quest is decent but these don’t taste very nice. I personally prefer PURE PROTEIN or BAREBELLS for taste.

16/06/2025, 6:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the size. Sauces are usually hot sauce which has 0 calories. Vegetables again are minimal. 

It’s the garlic sauce, hummus and oil that matters

This is what i logged yesterday for the first time, when i was checking the overall nutrition carbs were more what tweaks can i do to reduce carbs and increase proteins?
17/06/2025, 9:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you measured raw the lentils raw then log raw and if you measured or weighed after cooking then log as cooked
17/06/2025, 9:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks good
17/06/2025, 9:08 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): for tea log the amount of milk used in tea
17/06/2025, 9:08 am - PF - Felicia Carlton: I measured both ways 😂 didnt know which one should go
17/06/2025, 9:08 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): simple chicken ki jagah search the specific chicken part u had n log as raw or cooked depending on how u weighed it
17/06/2025, 9:09 am - PF - Felicia Carlton: Its a tea whitner like millac everyday
17/06/2025, 9:09 am - PF - Felicia Carlton: Noted
17/06/2025, 9:09 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if u r staying within your caloric limits & completing protein intake then carbs are not an issue

1tbsp = ~15g
1oz = ~28g
17/06/2025, 2:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Acc to this. 1tsp = ~5g ghee or 5g fat = ~45 kcal
17/06/2025, 2:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1g protein = ~4 kcal

17/06/2025, 2:21 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: Is having cornflakes  for breakfast a bad idea??
17/06/2025, 2:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): not a bad idea but i wont have protein so if u can add protein to the overall breakfast somehow with another food source then you are good to go
17/06/2025, 2:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: It isn't inherently 'bad,' but from a science-based perspective (my perspective lol), plain cornflakes are refined carbs, right? So this means they digest quickly, causing a rapid blood sugar spike and often leading to hunger soon after due to their low protein and fiber content. However, you can easily make them a "BETTER" choice by pairing them with a good source of protein (like milk, Greek yogurt, or protein powder) and some fiber (like fruit or chia seeds) to improve satiety and manage blood sugar. Dont have to mix them all with each other. You can have your cornfkales separately, then a Greek yogourt protein bowl with some fruits. 

Ultimately, whether it's a good idea depends on how it fits into your overall daily calorie and macro goals and if it helps you stay consistent with your breakfast routine. That's what matters!!! :)
17/06/2025, 2:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup, it’s mostly just carbs and also pretty low in fiber / protein. 

Is it bad? No. But it’s also not a very nutritious choice. 

Though you can make it nutritious. I usually add whey protein to it instead of milk. That covers the protein angle and then have an apple or something on the side to take care of the fiber.
17/06/2025, 2:30 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: I usually add my lactose free milk to it but it does not keep me full for longg..
17/06/2025, 2:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah because that’s at best 5-6g protein.
17/06/2025, 2:31 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: Thinking to add some sort of protein powder in my diet too but have no idea which one to go for
17/06/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: <Media omitted>
Does this look okay? I made french toast for myself with extra egg to increase my protein intake

Hey 
I consistently eat less carbs than I’m supposed to and more fat than I need to. 
Is this an issue in the long run? I try to stick to unsaturated fats but really struggle with being below 59 grams.
17/06/2025, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah cause it can easily add up to 100-200 calories across the day.
17/06/2025, 11:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely not. Calories and protein. The rest is your personal preference.

I will increase that should i add more eggs or ? Also This is what i was recommended as well, so according to what im eating will this work to restart my metabolism and help me with the weight loss or do I need to do anything else?
18/06/2025, 12:23 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: How much can we trust meal sprays/oil sprays?
18/06/2025, 12:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well he suggested closer to 1800. You’re eating 1500. 

So I’d move closer to that goal. 

And yes, eggs or any other protein source like sausages, cheese can also work.
18/06/2025, 12:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In what sense? I don’t think they’re going to cheat on you 😂

Like is it better to weigh out the oil or can we use oil sprays and trust the calories written on the back
18/06/2025, 12:26 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: I don’t trust myself around oil lmao. Everything needs a little bit more 🥲
18/06/2025, 12:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: It says 0 calories for a 0.1-second spray, but we definitely use more than that, don't we?

It's tricky to tell exactly how much we use, but you can always **add a gram or so** when you're tracking your food. It makes it less complicated!
18/06/2025, 12:28 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: For some reason my carbs always go up 😅😅😅 but its day 2 of tracking everything mindfully, so im trying to work things out, in  this case what should the ratio be of carbs and fats as well?
18/06/2025, 12:28 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: U proved my point 🤣
Thanks!
18/06/2025, 12:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. So always better to weigh.
18/06/2025, 12:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No ratios. Carbs and fats are personal preference as long as you’re in your calories.
18/06/2025, 12:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: As long as you're hitting your protein targets and staying under your calorie limits, you have flexibility with your carb and fat intake! Just make sure your fats don't go below 22-25% of your overall daily calories.

This is how I usually like to explain the carb-to-fat ratio:
- If you're craving foods like burgers, pizza, fries, or rice, these are higher in carbs, so you'd keep your carbs high and fats moderate for that meal or day.
- If, on another day, you're in the mood for cheesy pasta or grilled cheese sandwiches, these are higher in fat, so you'd have a higher fat intake with moderate carbs.

Both of these approaches are perfectly fine for the general population. (ALL OF US HERE!) Unless you're training for specific sports, it's absolutely okay!
18/06/2025, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Like Sameet said above, it's a personal preference! :)

Depends on what all you're adding

For example, these are the macros for a KFC zinger burger

But usually it's more carbs than protein
18/06/2025, 12:50 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: And what about beef burger?
18/06/2025, 12:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Both 100g chicken and beef have around ~22-25g of protein (not much of a difference)
18/06/2025, 12:52 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: <Media omitted>
Actually i have left these for my dinner....as my dinner is out for today want to have beef burger....asking for that....now dont know about that cafe have 100g or more
18/06/2025, 12:53 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: <Media omitted>
18/06/2025, 12:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: How have you already consumed 74g of protein in just 841 calories. Hmm. Something's off!!

Lunch ya hai mera

18/06/2025, 1:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hope much protein was there in lunch?
18/06/2025, 1:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Breakfast main tou 20g hai at best
18/06/2025, 1:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can fit a beef burger in this. Single patty.
18/06/2025, 1:41 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Bus yahi samj mjy nai ati ky ya kaisy pata chaly ga hr meal ka alag sy carb fat n protein ka....

18/06/2025, 2:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You used 150g raw chicken
18/06/2025, 2:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or cooked?
18/06/2025, 2:04 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Raw

18/06/2025, 2:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh tou not accurate hai
18/06/2025, 2:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 420-450. 
Let me show you how to track it.

18/06/2025, 2:42 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Quick question 
What’s an appropriate dish to have at Xander’s for dinner?
Considering I just had my first meal and I’m left with 1500 calories
18/06/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: <Media omitted>
18/06/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Almost everything can fit into 1500 but try to have something high in protein since you’re low in that
18/06/2025, 2:55 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Will tarragon chicken work? Should I skip the carbs that come with it?
18/06/2025, 2:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Terragon has a lot of fat (because of the cream), so your calories will add up quickly.

Instead, go for something with a dry base, perhaps with rice. That way, you can include a lot of protein and fewer calories.
18/06/2025, 3:01 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: How about a club sandwich?
18/06/2025, 3:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not much protein
18/06/2025, 3:02 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Moroccan chicken?
18/06/2025, 3:02 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: That also has a sauce
18/06/2025, 3:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Have something from this - focus more on proteins

rated it based on how I like to have it :p you can pick n choose!
18/06/2025, 3:04 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Oh flame grilled chicken sounds good
18/06/2025, 3:04 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Is that fine?
18/06/2025, 3:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup!

18/06/2025, 3:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: They won't be accurate. It's better to add individual entries in the app instead of a whole burger, unless it's from a big chain like KFC, subway, etc.
18/06/2025, 3:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe use roast beef ki entry

18/06/2025, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rice would be 1.25 cup cooked 
For curry maybe add Laksa worth (400ish calories)
18/06/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Laksa and thai curry are different right?
18/06/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Slightly. Laksa is Malaysia. 

Thai curry is from Thailand.

19/06/2025, 6:30 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: Coach Syed Ali qasim had a very nice short video on insta about calorie counting but i am unable to locate it now. 
Summarizing it. 
He said if you are making chicken karahi. The ingredients are chicken oil masala and tomato. 
1-Masala doesnot contribute to calories
2-Tomatoes doesn’t unless used alot (he didn’t tell what was alot but i am guessing 10-12) one day coach sameet told how many grams but i dont remember. 
3- oil ( if used alot 4-6 tsp, moderate 2-4 tsp, less 1-2 tsp) 
4- chicken (weigh it and log) 

That’s how you calculate <This message was edited>

19/06/2025, 10:24 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: But you’re right more like 1/2 cup for this amount
19/06/2025, 10:24 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Pooray batch mai to 1 cup se magi zyada hoga
19/06/2025, 10:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just log rice and oil

Looking forward to having your support!

Thank you in advance!
19/06/2025, 12:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hey Sana, have you gone through the starting guide in the Facebook community. @923343773307 must have tagged you in it.

Is this fine for recording kofta
19/06/2025, 1:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you have extra lean beef or what?
19/06/2025, 1:49 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: actually I'm not sure 🥲
19/06/2025, 1:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then use 80/20 beef. That’s the usual beef we get.
19/06/2025, 1:50 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: <Media omitted>
This?
19/06/2025, 1:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're eating 100g, that's atleast 260 kcal (raw beef), if it's cooked then a bit more.
Plus, 100g raw beef (80/20) has atleast ~15-16g of fat too!
19/06/2025, 1:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha yess!
19/06/2025, 1:51 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Ahhh alright! Thank you for the correction!
19/06/2025, 1:54 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: Please verify this : 
100g of boneless chicken approx 130 calories with 25g protein 
100g of boneless beef approx 250 calories with 25g protein
19/06/2025, 1:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Sounds alright.
19/06/2025, 1:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both raw weights.
19/06/2025, 1:55 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: Ok
19/06/2025, 1:55 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: I usually divide my 1400 calories into:

500-550 - Lunch
500-550 - Dinner
And the rest is divided into either having a 200 cal granola bar, or protein bar, or fruits usually.
On days I have swimming I'm generally hungrier, and this doesn't suffice. Would it be because maybe my protein intake is lesser?
19/06/2025, 1:56 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: <Media omitted>
So this entry is wrong ?
19/06/2025, 1:57 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: <Media omitted>

19/06/2025, 1:59 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: <Media omitted>
Also what about this entry ?
19/06/2025, 2:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's alright. But chicken breast may have more calories because of fat around it - which MOST people don't clean. So overtime that can add up!

I like to track 160 kcal for 100g boneless chicken breast. I am sharing that because I eat around 500-600g chicken everyday :) and those 30kcal x 6 = extra 180 kcal a day

Just nerdy stuff!! Lol
19/06/2025, 2:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be. Also you can use those extra calories and have a proper meal that might be more filling than a granola bar.
19/06/2025, 2:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just do 130 :p. 

But the chicken breast we get has no fat around it. If it does that’s going to my dogs lol.
19/06/2025, 2:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For beef, yeah. Beef has almost double the calories of chicken. Mutton is ever higher.
19/06/2025, 2:05 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: Ok . So I have tracking my beef consumption wrong 🙈
19/06/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: But why do these apps have wrong entries ?
19/06/2025, 2:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: MFP database is mostly user-generated! That's why. People like us have created wrong entries.
19/06/2025, 2:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is the biggest issue with MFP, which is why I was building Kalorist last year - I guess I should get started with it again soon. Hmm!!
19/06/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: ?
19/06/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: <Media omitted>
Is this accurate ?
19/06/2025, 2:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For now, this is why I prefer MacrosFirst. Much better entries.
19/06/2025, 2:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Roughly. Yes.
19/06/2025, 2:26 pm - PF - Saima Khurshid: Ok . Will download that and see how it goes
19/06/2025, 2:27 pm - PF - Mahnoor Aziz: What to incorporate in daily diet if i am targeting 130 grams of protein?
19/06/2025, 2:28 pm - PF - Mahnoor Aziz: And doesnt add up calories.. other than greek yogurt
19/06/2025, 2:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup!
I still go with MFP- much better UI imo 🤷‍♂
19/06/2025, 2:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: You don't need 130g of protein. Check your Facebook, I responded to your post last night.

Also, if you want to know what you can eat to get that much protein, I'd suggest you read this post on Facebook. I have shared two options #samplemealplan ;

1. 1700-1800 calories and 150g of protein
2. 1200-1400 calories and 100-110g of protein

19/06/2025, 11:24 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: Is it true that cooking rice in bone broth increases protein content in the meal or is it fake news
19/06/2025, 11:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: It can increase the protein content  by 1.137% 😅
19/06/2025, 11:29 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: Boo

This is how I found the listing - felt easier than breaking down ingredients
20/06/2025, 12:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but it might not be accurate unless it’s the same recipe.
20/06/2025, 12:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe just add some extra oil to be safe.
20/06/2025, 12:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just record kofta as ground beef.

20/06/2025, 5:03 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: 70% beef

20/06/2025, 5:03 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: If im not wrong
20/06/2025, 5:03 pm - PF - Maimoona Badar: How will I measure it once it’s cooked
20/06/2025, 5:05 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: I feel it’s easiest to develop a menu of some specific items and then upload them with your recipe in My Fitness Pal. Keep the food intake boring but specific. It helps. 
Tbh you can load 5 recipes or ten depending on how much variety you need and it’ll work (a few from breakfast. A few for lunch. A few for dinner. A few for snacks etc)
20/06/2025, 5:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Cooked beef and cooked lentils.
20/06/2025, 5:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Measure it before frying ideally.
20/06/2025, 5:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is a fantastic idea. The more variety you try to add, the complicated you’re making life. 

I usually eat the same 5-6 things on rotation and every few weeks, I’ll change everything up to some new 5-6 things.
20/06/2025, 5:11 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Agr raw chiken or raw daal measure krain tu ik kabab ki value kaisy aygi?.
20/06/2025, 5:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What do you mean? Total raw chicken and daal?
20/06/2025, 5:13 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Yup
20/06/2025, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then you’ll add total raw chicken and raw daal ki calories. 

And divide it by number of kebabs to get one kebab ki calories.
20/06/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I do the same!!
20/06/2025, 5:15 pm - PF - Samia Rao: sorry, can you please explain or correct me ? 
if I have frozen homemade beef kababs 

I'll weigh one let's say its 100g

is that so ?

20/06/2025, 7:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many kebabs did you make?
20/06/2025, 7:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you made 10 kebabs then:

500/10=50g raw chicken breast per kebab
70/10=7g of raw lentils per kebab

Also account for any oil used when frying
20/06/2025, 7:13 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: Thank u i made 10🥰

20/06/2025, 8:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 400g raw lentils will 1400 calories. 

But 400g after cooking is like 1.5kg daal.
20/06/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: After cooking it is 500g 
I made the dry one
20/06/2025, 9:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well 400g of raw daal is 1400 calories so with the oil it’s going to be closer to 1900.
20/06/2025, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If that’s divided into 3 servings then yes, one serving is closer to 650 calories.
20/06/2025, 9:08 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: That’s a lot, right? Or good to consume?
20/06/2025, 9:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Almas Abubakar: Myfitnesspal is showing a plan for 1270 calories and the coach said to take 1400-1500 calories. How I can fix this ?

20/06/2025, 10:39 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: My 15 yr old who would take my photos when i worked with sameet one to one says the same. If i say no to something he says but there’s no sameet anymore 😜
20/06/2025, 10:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. 

Please don’t overcomplicate things for yourself. 

Insulin resistance is multi factorial and limiting foods that spike insulin would end up with you drink oil for energy. 

Your focus should be on overall weight loss and potentially activity levels that can help insulin do its job.
20/06/2025, 10:40 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Sameet is not going anywhere hahahah
20/06/2025, 10:40 pm - PF - Samia Najam: he's got little fans too😂😂
20/06/2025, 10:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you weigh it? Because 200g chicken is a lot. That looks more like 60-70g
20/06/2025, 10:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also 3tsp oil is possible. Not 3 tbsp.
20/06/2025, 10:41 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i divided it into portion ... the other one i ate late at night😅😅
20/06/2025, 10:41 pm - PF - Samia Najam: yeah tsp
20/06/2025, 10:42 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i think i made a mistake in oil calculation
20/06/2025, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhhh. Phir it should be fine.
20/06/2025, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup.
20/06/2025, 10:42 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Thanks for the clarity. I am just so afraid of my insulin resistance and pre-diabetic condition these days 😔
20/06/2025, 10:42 pm - PF - Mahnoor Aziz: In the same boat
20/06/2025, 10:43 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Me also
20/06/2025, 10:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For both of these things, the priority is the same. 

Overall calories and protein /fiber being in every meal. 

Weight loss and activity levels (steps and workouts especially lifting weights) will help massively.

the log looks okay ?
20/06/2025, 10:44 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I have started berberine along with metformin. Adding more fiber, i realised in chasing chicken and rice for so many months i had completely forgotten veggies
20/06/2025, 10:45 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: So we can take dairy products?
Like can I take 1 cup of unsweetened milk in the morning?
20/06/2025, 10:45 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: May I know the brand of berberine you are taking?

20/06/2025, 11:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
20/06/2025, 11:03 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Thanks! 🌼
20/06/2025, 11:44 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Also is gut reset a thing ? Like if you’re not losing weight and someone tells you to go on a meat free diet to heal your gut ?
20/06/2025, 11:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely. Not. 

No scientific angle to this. 

Plus, if meat was that bad for us that we needed to take a break. I doubt it would be allowed in Islam either. 

Many angles to take to debunk this claim.
20/06/2025, 11:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But the best approach is to the person what does my gut need healing from?
20/06/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: “Chronic inflammation “

21/06/2025, 12:53 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks good.

21/06/2025, 12:53 am - PF - Samia Rao: Ok, thanks.
21/06/2025, 12:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Peas and corn aren’t that low. Other vegetables are.
21/06/2025, 12:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because that’s what you’ve been told. 

You did nothing wrong and you managed it really well. 

This is how we remove the guilt over time by embracing it and not judging ourselves for having it.

Because if there’s water retention then by definition your body has water. 

It could just be that you’re thirsty.

21/06/2025, 3:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We’ve trained ourselves to snack all the time so setting meal times and sticking to them can help regulate hunger over time. 

Also making sure your meals are big and satisfying so that you don’t feel hungry later. Protein and fiber are improtant for this.
21/06/2025, 3:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah looks decent.

21/06/2025, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This was just 282 calories so not really a big filling meal. That’s why you’re hungry later.

21/06/2025, 4:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you weigh it cooked, then you recorded as cooked rice in MyFitnessPal. 

And if you weigh raw, then record it as raw rice.

21/06/2025, 8:09 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Hiii. If I am in deficit, but haven’t hit my protein target - should I let it be that way? Like deficit is more important in terms of fat loss right? 

I would still be averaging 80 gms of protein but it should be 140 as per my macros.

21/06/2025, 10:41 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: It’s usually bland in its own taste but takes up the taste of whatever it is cooked with. Has a very silky texture

21/06/2025, 10:42 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: It tasted fantastic with oriental flavours but you can really add anything to it. Make a bhujia or something like andaa bhurji with it too

22/06/2025, 1:17 pm - PF - Fatima Shahid: Is this entry correct for tracking and making portions?
22/06/2025, 1:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Syntha and BPI are good!
@923441183411 I'd let Ali tell you which ones to pick based on flavors, etc.
22/06/2025, 1:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'd suggest you get it directly from their website- don't really trust daraz/their sellers selling food supplements (unless it's Protein Works on page on Daraz, then it's fine)
22/06/2025, 1:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is good. But it's raw!
22/06/2025, 1:19 pm - PF - Fatima Shahid: Yes im measuring raw
22/06/2025, 1:19 pm - PF - Fatima Shahid: Gonna cook from scratch and freeze then
22/06/2025, 1:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: So when you're entering it in the app, you'll need to add oil, yogurt, etc too.

22/06/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: That’s what I do too. But I put in the actual nutrient information of the ingredients I’m using.
22/06/2025, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but it’s not always accurate so you’ll be estimating calories and estimates can be wrong too. 

It makes sense to actual track it. And use estimates for when you can’t track it.
22/06/2025, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this makes it more accurate. With the oil and all other calculations.
22/06/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Maimoona Badar: My fitness pal is a bit confusing to me
22/06/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Maimoona Badar: Specially to add the quantities.
22/06/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Maimoona Badar: Like how actual
Nutrient information ?
22/06/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: The simplest way is adding the weight of the items u are using.
22/06/2025, 9:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Close to 300-350 since it usually has cream and coconut milk.
22/06/2025, 9:01 pm - PF - Prof. Dr. Najia Saher: Hi. Am new here. 
Can someone tell which app being used by everyone to calculate calories ?
22/06/2025, 9:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weigh out your food and ingredients.
22/06/2025, 9:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
I hope you all have read this.
22/06/2025, 9:01 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: I mean, whatever is on the back of the item like milk/mayo with its weight and the weight of any generic stuff, like veggies and oil.
22/06/2025, 9:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s in the Facebook community.
22/06/2025, 9:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: MacrosFirst or MyFitnessPal. Both are fine.
22/06/2025, 9:02 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: You should basically be married to your food scale
22/06/2025, 9:02 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: 🤣
22/06/2025, 9:02 pm - PF - Maimoona Badar: Yes that’s what I did. Weigh the food and add it to chat gpt to get the calories. Will it still be giving the wrong calories or is it fine or do you still think I should learn my fitness pal.
22/06/2025, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha honestly though it takes me like 30 extra seconds to log all the weights. 

You can open up ChatGPT and dictate the weights to it. Taht should tell you calories.
22/06/2025, 9:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Almas Abubakar: Seriously
22/06/2025, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then it’s not bad. As long as you’re weighing out your portions.
22/06/2025, 9:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Again, this is in the Facebook community. But look at how easy it can be. 

Took me 90 secs while recording and explaining it. 

Otherwise less than 60 seconds.

22/06/2025, 10:06 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: https://www.recipetineats.com/creamy-garlic-prawn-pasta/

Make healthier swaps - half n half, low fat milk, reduce amount of butter and oil. Don’t cook the prawn separately in butter instead, add to the sauce as it cooks very quickly.

It's my first day tracking it a bit more attentively as compared to past 2-3 days, I did forget to weight few things so I added an estimate. This is what it looks like for now. I had a leftover chicken hot plate that I combined with pasta but I didn't weigh how much the chicken dish was and I don't have a pic so I added by estimate for today after a bit of research to whatever looked closer to it 🤔 i will however try to weigh more before eating. I hope it looks right.. so I hope it looks fine. I scanned the pasta and cheese by barcode and I did weigh them.

I was just reading that gram flour has way more protein than whole wheat and almost same calories
23/06/2025, 10:24 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes it has more protein
23/06/2025, 10:24 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: But we were discussing that 100g wheat roti is like 240cal?
23/06/2025, 10:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Thats because 100g roti is not all flour but jb aap dough bnaty ho to us ma paani bhi dalta hai
23/06/2025, 10:25 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: You all are so smart 🌸

Genrly round bun is 60-70g which is ~200 calories
23/06/2025, 10:32 am - PF - Farah Salman: Bake parlor and dawn k back pe jo calories mentioned hoti hain are they reliable?
23/06/2025, 10:34 am - PF - Farah Salman: Bake parlor says bran bread 1 slice is 30gm and 59 cals
Bake parlor round bun is 65gm and 154 cals

23/06/2025, 10:41 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Dawn burger bun has 271 calories per 100g 
so for a 70g bun it will be 190 calories & for 60g bun 163 calories 

So both brands have comparable numbers

23/06/2025, 11:21 am - PF - Sana Akbar: Choose "scrambled eggs" option from MyFitnessPal and then choose oil separately?
23/06/2025, 11:22 am - PF - Gulalai Anas: Egg only not scramble egg
23/06/2025, 11:23 am - PF - Sana Akbar: Okay dear, thanks a lot! ❣️ 
Can you please help me in logging 1 slice of 80% fiber bran bread?
Pictures are shared above!
23/06/2025, 11:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): weigh the slice of bread & just log as bran bread
23/06/2025, 11:24 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): or if u have calories for 1 slice written on the pack then log that number
23/06/2025, 11:27 am - PF - Sana Akbar: Actually, I am very new to weighing my meals and counting calories. Kitchen scales wasn't available at my home that's why I ordered it and it will arrive in 3 - 4 days. @923343773307 asked me not to wait for kitchen scale and start sharing pictures of my meal in group and community members will help me counting calories for my meals till I get kitchen scale.
Also no calories are mentioned on the pack I have.

23/06/2025, 1:12 pm - PF - Farwa Raza: Ahhh 🥴🥴
23/06/2025, 1:13 pm - PF - Farah Salman: If we r using mitchells timatopaste around 25 grms
23/06/2025, 1:13 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Do we hav to track it
23/06/2025, 1:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: > Salted Popcorn: Small/Regular: Around 300–600 calories
> Sweet (Caramel) Popcorn: Typically higher in calories due to added sugar and coatings:
> Small: Approximately 250–400 calorie & Large: Around 800–1,200 calories​

It really varies because different places have different serving sizes also!
23/06/2025, 1:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: ^
23/06/2025, 1:13 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thanks Taha. I was thinking in the same ballpark

Can easily go up to 100kcal per serving. Speaking from experience. 😋 <This message was edited>

This is the nutrition label for Mitchells Ketchup.

No no
Im talking abt paste
23/06/2025, 1:18 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Tomato puree and tomato paste and tomato ketchup

23/06/2025, 1:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A diet soda is generally your best bet hahahaha. 

Popcorns can be super high based on the amount of butter used. 

Nachos with cheese can easily crossed 650-800 calories too.
23/06/2025, 1:18 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Calories are pretty much same as regular ones
23/06/2025, 1:19 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: I need help in preparing food in bulk like if in making chicken ka salan or something else
Jisko i plan to consume for 3-4 servings spread out in a week!

How do i track an individual serving?
Can my fitness pal or any other app help with that?

If yes how?

Because i can accurately track a single serving of any item i make, but whenever i cook more food for multiple servings i struggle in tracking a single serving out of the bulk preped food
23/06/2025, 1:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I just record these as tomatoes.
23/06/2025, 1:20 pm - PF - Farah Salman: 25 gm tomato is 5 cals
But im sure 25 g  tomato paste mai ziada tomatoes use hue hunge
23/06/2025, 1:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, but the canned versions are pretty much the same, with added sugar, etc.
23/06/2025, 1:21 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Hmmm
Better to use tomatoes then
23/06/2025, 1:22 pm - PF - Farwa Raza: I swear .. I was addicted to frozen french vanilla from Tim hortons i used to take daily .. According to google before it was 300ish calories so i thought it was under safe zone but later after months i got to know its was 670 cal 😵‍💫
23/06/2025, 1:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
This is the label for Mitchells Tomato paste- what's the difference really?
33g serving has 60 calories!

@923002016595
23/06/2025, 1:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup. Exactly. 
internet has ruined these things, and then people say "we tried calorie counting but it never works for me", yeah, it won't work because it's not being done the right way lol

23/06/2025, 2:24 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: Calculate the calories and macros of the meal in full using MFP and nutrient labels. Weigh out and make equal portions. Divide the weight by number of servings. 

That’s how I do it. @923343773307 please correct if wrong.
23/06/2025, 2:26 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: Hi, how to track Thai green curry?
23/06/2025, 2:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oil
Chicken broth
Coconut milk
Chicken

I think these are the only things used in Thai Green Curry that have calories
23/06/2025, 2:29 pm - You removed PF - Mina Rizvi

23/06/2025, 2:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Post this on Facebook pls
23/06/2025, 2:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's correct. Except for the egg's entry. Why did you add two when you ate one?
23/06/2025, 2:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, you're correct. That's one way to do it for sure. 🙏🏽
I find it the easier also (takes a bit more effort for sure)
23/06/2025, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the brand.
23/06/2025, 2:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Pakistani brands add sugar lol that's why its good to be cautious <This message was edited>

23/06/2025, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you Coach! 😅
23/06/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Arusha Adnan: I track the chicken it’s 100grams and the curry is 86grams.

23/06/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Im finding this more doable and just dividing the whole quantity with number of servings, im usually checking on chat gpt the break up of quantities for calorie tracking so that i can just use that measurement 😬😬

Hey everyone! Quick and important tip regarding MyFitnessPal:

We highly recommend you turn off exercise calories in the app. You can do this by going to Menu/Settings > Steps > Don't track Steps and switching the toggle off.

This prevents MFP from automatically adding back calories based on your workouts, which can accidentally put you out of your deficit! We want to make sure your hard work counts towards your goals, so let's keep that setting off to stay on track.
23/06/2025, 3:08 pm - PF - Maria Saleem: Didn’t even notice it logged 2 eggs! 😅 But I got it fixed now.
23/06/2025, 3:20 pm - PF - Majida Bukhari / Raila: @923343773307

23/06/2025, 3:26 pm - PF - Majida Bukhari / Raila: Sorry typo mistake 22 kababs
23/06/2025, 3:32 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: <Media omitted>
How much oul should I caculate in this 1 cup daal? I didnt make it.
23/06/2025, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Log 1kg beef and 600 lentils in the app as a recipe. And set 22 servings. 

You’ll get calories and macros for one kebab
23/06/2025, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1.5tsp is safe. 2.5 if it had tarka. <This message was edited>

For my learning and support on the group i did it, please check if its okay? 1kg lean beef and 600gms chana daal only 

No oil at all
Please see if its ok? The per kebab macros and the recipie logging on the app
23/06/2025, 3:41 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Protein 15g

And far 6g
23/06/2025, 3:44 pm - PF - Majida Bukhari / Raila: JazakAllah 
I have just started using MFP.
So I'm in my learning phase 🙂
23/06/2025, 3:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Looks decent. 

The usual keema we get is 80/20 so might need to change for that. Otherwise this is okay.
23/06/2025, 3:56 pm - PF - Majida Bukhari / Raila: This message was deleted
23/06/2025, 3:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: As in beef?
23/06/2025, 4:00 pm - PF - Majida Bukhari / Raila: Yes beaf
23/06/2025, 4:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s still 80/20 ground beef when tracking.
23/06/2025, 4:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Beef generally has fat. But yeah if you couldn’t see any marbling then go for the 90/10 option
23/06/2025, 4:03 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: If I’m making stir fry for 2 people with approx 330g raw boneless chicken and some veggies, how do I distribute the calories? I mean one serving might have more chicken than the other. How do I keep a track of that? Or should I stir fry chicken separately and veggies separately and dish out after measuring
23/06/2025, 4:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Half them. Easiest option. Don’t stress about exactly dividing things. 

Just divide the actual dish in half.
23/06/2025, 4:04 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Thankyou! 😁
23/06/2025, 4:23 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: If we consume chia seed water, are we required to log that too?

23/06/2025, 4:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t focus on the sugar content too much. 

Focus on the basics. Don’t overcomplicate things. 

These things are only important if you have a condition like diabetes or high cholesterol.

23/06/2025, 5:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is much easier. Don’t have to wait for the tomatoes to soften. 

Also you need much less of this. 100g of paste is like 500g tomatoes.

23/06/2025, 6:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That you’ll understand once you start. 

First step is share what you’re having and I’ll explain how to track it

Bought myself K&Ns Fiery Chicken Fingers and they are so good! 
I wanted to have a cupcake (I was hungry because I hadn’t had my lunch then) but I made these quickly (no wait time in here for these 🥲)
Enjoyed my cupcake later 👀
23/06/2025, 7:09 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: HI everyone, I am joining back after a gap of 5 months or so. Feels l ike there are more people now than before :) I have a question: If compared by volume, frozen veggies seem to weigh to more than fresh ones, does that have an impact on calories per gram? I dont mention whether they are frozen or fresh while tracking.
23/06/2025, 7:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope, there's no single pre-workout snack, and what helps really depends on your individual situation and when you last ate!

- If you've had a full meal 2-3 hours before your workout, you likely don't need anything extra. Your body will have plenty of fuel
- If you're heading into a workout feeling hungry or haven't eaten for 4-6+ hours, a quick snack about 30-60 minutes beforehand can definitely help. Focus on easily digestible carbohydrates for quick energy (like a banana, a couple of dates, or a small piece of fruit) along with a little protein to keep you sustained (like a banana, a few nuts, a hard-boiled egg, or a couple of sips of a protein shake)
- If you're training first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and feel good, you might not need anything at all. Many people train fasted successfully. However, if you feel sluggish or lightheaded, a small, quick-digesting carb source (like half a banana) can make a big difference without upsetting your stomach.

The main goal is to have enough energy to perform well without feeling too full or getting stomach cramps.
23/06/2025, 7:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: That added weight is mostly because of the ice crystals and water content from the freezing process. This doesn't impact the actual calories per gram of the vegetable itself, or degrade the nutritional value.
23/06/2025, 7:11 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Thanks
23/06/2025, 7:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ah! This is amazing. I want some now. Lol!

I cooked chicken qeema today. Used 1 tablespoon of olive oil and around 250 grams of chicken qeema. I have added 3 tomatoes during cooking. Should I log those tomatoes as well or just oil and qeema?
Actually I want to know if we are supposed to log other ingredients like onions, ginger, garlic or tomatoes as well?

Also I have taken 6 tablespoons of chicken qeema and half plate rice and one cucumber in dinner. How am I supposed to count calories of this?

Picture is attached for your reference. Please note that I have no kitchen scale at the moment that's why I am unable to weigh ingredients of my meals. Need your help!
23/06/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is likely 300-400
23/06/2025, 10:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oil and Qeema is fine. You can add tomatoes if you want for safety. 

I’d record this as 120g raw chicken breast 0.5tbsp oil.
23/06/2025, 10:53 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: And grams of rice?

23/06/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Gulalai Anas: > Salted Popcorn: Small/Regular: Around 300–600 calories
> Sweet (Caramel) Popcorn: Typically higher in calories due to added sugar and coatings:

It really varies because different places have different serving sizes also!
23/06/2025, 11:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this is approx. 225-250g rice

Does a binge of whatever amount of calories really erase the deficit you have built up AND your progress? 
Does that mean you are back to where you started?
23/06/2025, 11:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the amount of calories you had. If Monday to Saturday your deficit was 1000 calories and you had an extra 1000 ka surplus on Sunday then yes.

Okay, so I was bored with my fitbit app today. I have AuDHD, so this happens sometimes. Decided to test GPT. Added instructions about food databases and asked it to track calories and macros today. I will test it against fitbit tomorrow, I guess, but what do the coaches do think? Is it on point or glitching?

24/06/2025, 11:39 am - PF - Nisha Rehman: How many servings shall I log?
24/06/2025, 11:39 am - PF - Nisha Rehman: And how do I know how many gm per serving?
24/06/2025, 11:39 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: We make something called Khichrra in our household. Which is kind of like a Haleem (but different) I have that in my recipes
24/06/2025, 11:40 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: You see however much you eat in one go. Let’s say one cup or two cups and see how many multiples of that come out of one batch that you’ve cooked
24/06/2025, 11:40 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Like my Khichrra I assign it 10 servings
24/06/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: It’s 200gms mutton and 2 cups daal and one cup grains.
24/06/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Just an example

Is this fine for boneless beef?
24/06/2025, 11:49 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just log 80/20 cooked ground beef
24/06/2025, 11:50 am - PF - Nisha Rehman: Is it the same as raw beef?
24/06/2025, 11:50 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u measured raw ?
24/06/2025, 11:50 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then search 80/20 ground beef raw
24/06/2025, 11:52 am - PF - Nisha Rehman: Yes
24/06/2025, 11:52 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then this
24/06/2025, 11:53 am - PF - Nisha Rehman: <Media omitted>
Okay?
24/06/2025, 11:57 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): looks fine
24/06/2025, 12:22 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: Hi. So how many calories would there be in chicken pepper steak/fillet with pepper corn sauce. Made with Half a chicken breast? Thanks
24/06/2025, 12:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Raw is always more accurate but you can do both.
24/06/2025, 12:31 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Fucking hell. 🙈 I'm so glad I still had plenty calories left over
24/06/2025, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track 220g raw chicken and pepper corn sauce in MFP and you'll get the calories and macros

Ideally it's best to weigh your food to know the numbers, or atleast share it's picture so at can guide better <This message was edited>
24/06/2025, 12:39 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: So just to clarify for future entries, I can use the same entry (salmon baked) but I just need to convert the weight from cooked to raw and log it as that? 😬
24/06/2025, 12:41 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
The calories seem to match with what you mentioned above after updating weight
24/06/2025, 12:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s likely a coincidence. 540 is raw salmon so I’d just use raw salmon ki entry
24/06/2025, 12:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But for now this works
24/06/2025, 12:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Thank you ❤️
24/06/2025, 12:50 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: Yes ok I ll start taking pictures from now on. Eating this at a restaurant tonight so was thinking I would get a rough idea so I can track the calories for the rest of the day accordingly. I ll see if I have a picture from before. 

Otherwise I will roughly track with MyFitnessPal.

Thank you

This is what yesterday looked like
24/06/2025, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it was at a restaurant then it wouldn't be 220g. Only 100g as that's the usual serving size, but again can't tell for sure
24/06/2025, 1:52 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: <Media omitted>
It’s about this size and the sauce also the same amount but I can ask for it separately.
24/06/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: <Media omitted>
Can someone guide me on how many calories in this raita, no ml or grams written on the packaging
24/06/2025, 2:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: This looks like 350g
24/06/2025, 2:52 pm - PF - Madiha Asif Bhagat: <Media omitted>
how many calories and proteins in these shami kebabs, made from dice beef
24/06/2025, 2:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just beef or did it have lentils?
24/06/2025, 2:54 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: <Media omitted>
So according to that is this fine in calories?
24/06/2025, 2:55 pm - PF - Madiha Asif Bhagat: beef and channa dal
24/06/2025, 2:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add yoghurt to be more accurate.
24/06/2025, 2:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then do 70g cooked ground beef and 30g cooked lentils for this.
24/06/2025, 2:56 pm - PF - Madiha Asif Bhagat: thanks Sameet 😊
24/06/2025, 2:57 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: Hi. Can you please address this? Thank you 🙏
24/06/2025, 2:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you going to order this? Send the actual picture once you do. 

Ask for sauce on the side so that helps lower calories too.
24/06/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Thats come to 206 calories is that fine?
24/06/2025, 2:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
24/06/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Thanks
24/06/2025, 2:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This looks like 300g chicken breast
150g mashed potatoes 
And 5tsp oil
24/06/2025, 2:59 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: Yes I will but it looks just the same and also I want to have something for lunch 🫣so trying to get the dinner calories straight first
24/06/2025, 2:59 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: Mine will be served with fries. About 10 of them. I can ofcourse skip them
24/06/2025, 3:00 pm - PF - Mariam Imran: Ok
24/06/2025, 3:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 10 fries? That’s probably 40g or so.

Can @923343773307  or @60193244266 

Is this brown rice protein really 24grams per scoop?

And would u recommend this as a pocket friendly protein supplement?

Has anyone from the group tried it?
Taste review?

24/06/2025, 3:58 pm - PF - Uzair Kamal: Which brand should i take supplements like fish oil magnesium vitamins ?
24/06/2025, 4:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Omega 3? Yes.
24/06/2025, 4:01 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Apart from omega 3
What are some of the essentials vitamis generally that everyone should consider having?
24/06/2025, 4:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can have it, but it's not a complete amino acid profile as per my knowledge. So you'll have to combine it with other food /protein sources to get the most out of it
24/06/2025, 4:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're having 2-3 servings of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis, you don't need any vitamins etc, except for Vit D3 (but that too if you're not getting any sunlight) <This message was edited>
24/06/2025, 4:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: These things are individual and not a one-size-fits-all thing
24/06/2025, 4:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: No one needs supplements if their diet is good. But if it's lacking, then supplements can help, but the first priority should always be to improve dietary intake through *whole foods*
24/06/2025, 4:03 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Thankyou
24/06/2025, 4:05 pm - PF - Uzair Kamal: Can we do test? And takes the supplements? Then
24/06/2025, 4:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I personally don’t trust Jacked Nutrition. Having worked with them for a couple of years I know they cut corners. I know they save money and they don’t really care about their consumers.
24/06/2025, 4:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Their omega 3 is also weird. It’s not fish OIL. it’s a pill, omega 3 is almost always oil.
24/06/2025, 4:07 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Speaking of oil

If its fish oil - the omega 3 pill
Does it have calories from fat? Or is it a supplement only with nõ calories
24/06/2025, 4:08 pm - PF - Uzair Kamal: Which brand you recommend or use ?
24/06/2025, 4:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: For people living in Pakistan, it's not easy to procure good quality ones, tbh. But if you can find any sports supplement brand (authenthic ones), then go for it.
I used to get MyProtein only.
Now I am using Blackmores.
24/06/2025, 4:09 pm - PF - Uzair Kamal: .
24/06/2025, 4:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Apparently, their omega-3 has 800mg EPA + 600mg DHA
24/06/2025, 4:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: For Vitamin D, testing is often helpful since deficiency is so common and it guides dosage. 
For other general supplements like vitamins and minerals, and Omega-3 or B12, you usually don't need a test first, as they often offer broad health benefits. 

We only recommend targeted tests if clear symptoms, dietary restrictions, or specific health concerns are present (for a long long time). I'd say be strategic with your resources!
24/06/2025, 4:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1g fat = 9 kcal 
think of this as that too!

but this many calories don't make or break anything, no need to worry about it
24/06/2025, 4:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Apparently. Kahan say aaraha hai? No idea since they don’t mention it.
24/06/2025, 5:04 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: <Media omitted>
Estimated calories for this, please. Didn’t have butter, sausage is chicken and eggs were poached instead. One slice of sourdough bread. Didn’t have the Macon either.

Also had a flat white.

Hello FoMo family! 🌸

I air-fried pre-marinated chicken breast without using any oil for lunch. Should I log it as cooked chicken breast or raw chicken breast?
24/06/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: If u weighted the chicken breast while marinating and u have the raw weight log it raw 

Otherwise just weigh the cooked portion and log it as cooked chicken breast entry
24/06/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: I don’t have a kitchen scale at the moment, so I’m estimating portions with the help of all the community members and coaches. I’ll log it as cooked chicken breast. Thanks so much! 🌼
24/06/2025, 5:25 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Aisa hai to sameet or the other coahes can help you 

Because they can only give you a correct estimate by eyeballing your portion size
24/06/2025, 5:26 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Sure, thanks for letting me know!
24/06/2025, 5:26 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: @923343773307 @60193244266  Please help! 🥺
24/06/2025, 5:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can track it either cooked or raw. Raw volume/weight is more due to water in it. When cooked, it shrinks and weighs less.
If it's measured raw then it's more accurate.

Now since we don't have the actual measured number, I'd track this fillet as 100g cooked chicken or 125g raw chicken
24/06/2025, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: log it as 120g raw breast.
24/06/2025, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh wow. Fairly close hahahaha
24/06/2025, 5:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha I guess we know a thing or two about this nutrition whatever we do here. 😂
24/06/2025, 5:32 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Thanks Taha! 🌸
24/06/2025, 5:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fat white from Starbucks or Dunkin. 

2 whole eggs
KnN cocktails sausage around 30g
Bread 35g
Oil 3tsp
24/06/2025, 5:32 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Thanks Sameet! 🌸

24/06/2025, 5:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: And some sauteed mushrooms, around ~30g?
24/06/2025, 5:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve incorporated uska oil. Mushrooms itself won’t have much.
24/06/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Hello coaches!

If we make curd at home, should we use the whey that separates from it? I’ve heard that this whey shouldn't be used—is that true?
24/06/2025, 5:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why not? Mix it in. Or use it in smoothies or even curries to increase nutrients and protein slightly.
24/06/2025, 5:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: I use that in my pastas - it increases the protein content :)
24/06/2025, 5:43 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Oh, I kept wasting it and got scolded by my Amma every time. She says "Hum apnay bachpan say khaatay aa rahay hain or tum logon say zayada fit hain abhi tak. Tum logon nay apni science nikaali hui hai. 😅
24/06/2025, 5:43 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Woww - it's a great use. Will definitely try. ❤️
24/06/2025, 5:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can now tell her main sun rahi hoon aapki baat. She’ll get happy too hahaha
24/06/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: She already knows that I am following you and Taha now. She will get to know k ye akal mujhe aap say hi mili hogi, mujh main nahi itni akal. 😅
24/06/2025, 5:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha we’ve all been there! I used to tell people in 2011-12 to stay away from zero-cal sodas and that aspartame was the devil. 😅 But honestly, we learn and evolve. That’s the beauty of it. The more we stay curious, the more we grow!
24/06/2025, 5:51 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Sometimes I just wish there were a way to ban or erase those people from the internet, those who spread misinformation on Instagram, YouTube and elsewhere. It’s because of them that so many of us ended up so misinformed. But thanks to Allah, I’ve now found you I can blindly trust and that means everything. ❤️

24/06/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Also a question regarding hung curd,

Can we log it as greek yogurt
24/06/2025, 9:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably. Full fat greek yoghurt.
24/06/2025, 9:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because yoghurt has very less protein from whey. It has more protein coming from casein. 

In the process you also condense the yoghurt down to be higher in protein per 100g
24/06/2025, 9:23 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: yeah but then it becomes Denver and haveair... like you may eat 1 cup plain yogurt but can't have 1 cup greek yogurt at one time.

24/06/2025, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weigh the actual roti instead.
24/06/2025, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do 130g cooked ground lamb and 3tsp oil. 

And then roti ka weight. 50g ki roti is 120-130 calories.
24/06/2025, 10:09 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: I've got ur point but I just need a clarity that plain yogurt is equally good for protein as Greek yogurt or its not the case?
24/06/2025, 10:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Greek yogurt 100g has 9g protein. 

Plain yoghurt 100g has 3-5g protein.
24/06/2025, 10:09 pm - PF - Eman Ali: Also is “Greek style yogurt” Greek yogurt? I am also a little confused
24/06/2025, 10:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. It’s different. Just go with the label on the product.
24/06/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Eman Ali: I wasnt able to find greek yogurt in alfatah they just has greek style yogurt
24/06/2025, 10:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah Pakistan main Greek yogurt is a bit difficult to find.

24/06/2025, 10:51 pm - PF - Maham Haseeb: Speaking of this, my coke zero intake is quite high, and I have 1 every day, like there’ll hardly be a day when I dont have it. I know it doesn’t impact the calories, but will there be any other impact I should be aware of potentially?
24/06/2025, 10:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 a day is high?
24/06/2025, 10:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i have atleast 2 a day😄
24/06/2025, 10:53 pm - PF - Maham Haseeb: Its not? Always thought it is
24/06/2025, 10:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
24/06/2025, 10:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I hope you meant 1 liter per day 🤣

24/06/2025, 10:54 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: <Media omitted>
What to choose?
24/06/2025, 10:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The only potential problem is that carbonation is bad for teeth. But that’s not a diet side issue. It’s everything with carbonation. Even sparkling water.
24/06/2025, 10:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1st one.
24/06/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Thanks! 🌸

todays a little high in calories .... but did the homeworkout + 35 minutes of cycling
24/06/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: 5 almonds contain 164 calories? 😱
24/06/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Samia Najam: also in other news i'm not loosing on scale at all , but lost the inches really quick
24/06/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No you’ll have to change the weight. It’s showing 1 oz.
24/06/2025, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s still progress.
24/06/2025, 11:08 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: 5 almonds have how much weight approximately?
24/06/2025, 11:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It might have 1 almond option.
24/06/2025, 11:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So just add 5 almonds
24/06/2025, 11:12 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Sure Sameet, thank you! 🌸
24/06/2025, 11:26 pm - PF - Samia Rao: 1. peeling ,deseeding and then weighing my lychee so I dont waste a single gram of them 🥹🤪is that okay ,or do we have any easier way ? 
2. can you please guide me about the dates log in? like ajwa and Amber?  one is smaller hence lighter in weight later is bigger in size ..how do we log in these ? also guide about figs,do we need to weigh them or add 1, 2 figs as is ? any leads with correct log -ins would help alot.
3. I am weighing cooked roti 100g and entering it as @60193244266 guided ie 277 cals , what if I am using 50g kneaded dough and then making roti what would be the entry in MFP then ? 
4. If I am hitting the protein goal ,staying within my deficit but using recipes like white sauce pasta, a chicken karai made with cream, or coconut milk 👻 is that okay ? I think if I batch cook karai and pasta with cream my cravings would be satisfied and I can eat the same meals every day happily and stay on track ,would this be disturbing my overall health in the longer run? like using cream, cheese etc etc 🤓 I know I am in a obese postpartum bracket but all of my blood works are totally fine as of now 😂 ido eat fresh veges and walk around but with the nursing baby I keep on thinking about all the cheesy , calorie dense meals 

sorry about such questions but this is what is on my mind right now 🤓
24/06/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1. Weigh one seed and just use that weight for each seed. Like if you eat 10 lychees then minus 80g for seeds. 
2. ⁠weigh the dates for most accurate calorie count. Same for figs. 
3. ⁠this is impossible to tell cause it depends on how much water you’ve used. This is why you either weigh the flour before kneading or weigh the roti. 
4. ⁠yes but adding veggies is always a good idea 
5. ⁠Also, please use Facebook for detailed questions 😂

I think I messed up a little today because I ate a personal pizza, and that’s why my carbs and fats are showing over, while I still have protein remaining. What should I do😅
25/06/2025, 12:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nothing. You’re still in your calories. That’s the important bit.
25/06/2025, 12:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just try to get your protein tomorrow
25/06/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Maria Saleem: Okay thank you 😇

25/06/2025, 12:37 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Guys need help logging 100g of homemade butter chicken (I didn’t make it so confused)
25/06/2025, 1:10 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: How many calories in one grilled/ namkeen  lamb chop?
25/06/2025, 1:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: The problem is when you’re having multiple things it becomes really difficult to track calories. 

Estimating for each bit is very difficult and you’re likely also going to overeat because of something known as sensory specific satiety. 

Which is basically if every bite tastes different, you will eat more.
25/06/2025, 1:27 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: @923012411072 so likely that meal is around 1200-1500.
25/06/2025, 1:27 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Log chicken, cream and butter.
25/06/2025, 1:28 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the size.
25/06/2025, 1:32 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Medium sized, not to small, definitely not big. I couldn't weigh as we were in a restaurant
25/06/2025, 1:32 am - PF - Aminah Aziz: I have logged 1400. Bas isse upar jaanay ka mann nahi hai 😂 
Thanks coach!
25/06/2025, 1:34 am - PF - Aminah Aziz: Yes I understand this. Familiar with the concept as well. Isliye had a huge chunk of calories saved beforehand.
25/06/2025, 3:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: In these instances, pictures always help.
25/06/2025, 3:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: But it’ll likely be around 250-400
25/06/2025, 4:01 am - PF - Bismah Mughal: Hello, I’m very new to calorie counting and this week is insanely busy so I am not able to go through the videos and starter guide for now. But don’t want to overeat. If I eat two baked chicken drumsticks for lunch and two for dinner would I be able to hit my protein goal of 100-110 grams a day. Asking because google is giving me conflicting responses.
25/06/2025, 4:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you share pictures of how big those drumsticks are or if you know what they weigh, then I can guide you more accurately. 

But very likely no. It’ll be likely 30-35g protein per meal. 

Unless they are large AF.
25/06/2025, 4:15 am - PF - Bismah Mughal: null

25/06/2025, 4:16 am - PF - Bismah Mughal: I’ve ordered a kitchen scale but it’s not here yet
25/06/2025, 4:20 am - Taha Ahmed: Nope. You can have 1-2 everyday. Any carbonated drink can damage tooth enamel due to their acidity but only if you drink liters of it for months and months and don't practically eat much food/drink water in between
25/06/2025, 4:24 am - Taha Ahmed: These look large af!! But it'd still be approx. ~35g per meal like Sameet said and if you had 2 for lunch and 2 for dinner then that's approx. ~70g only! <This message was edited>
25/06/2025, 4:25 am - Taha Ahmed: IF you're busy then try convenience foods this week!
Greek yogurt, nuts, nuggets, these drumsticks, protein shakes, protein bars (so that you're atleast consistently hitting your calories and protein) <This message was edited>
25/06/2025, 4:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah those are pretty big so 4 of them are likely 70-80g protein. 

You can add another 20-30 using other convenience foods like Taha suggested. 

Or 3 eggs for breakfast 🤷
25/06/2025, 4:49 am - PF - Bismah Mughal: Makes sense. Thank you! 🙏

@923343773307 @60193244266
25/06/2025, 11:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just log the quantity of milk used in doodh pati
25/06/2025, 12:00 pm - PF - Majida Bukhari / Raila: Ok
25/06/2025, 12:04 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Sorry but I wasn’t sure how much cream and butter to log 🥲
25/06/2025, 12:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It was 100g so do 100g raw chicken thigh
10g cream
15g butter. 

Can’t really say much without a picture because 100g can be full of chicken or it can be just gravy.
25/06/2025, 12:18 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: <Media omitted>
Not the best photo but this is 100g butter chicken on 100g rice
25/06/2025, 12:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This works then
25/06/2025, 12:25 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: <Media omitted>
@60193244266 @923343773307 please guide me
25/06/2025, 12:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What is it?
25/06/2025, 12:28 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: 1 whole egg with small onion n small capsicum 
1 whole wheat bread 
Half cub milk (ghr ka milk) chai banae with stevia
25/06/2025, 12:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Record it as:

1 whole egg
1 slice bread
Oil used for frying
50ml milk.
25/06/2025, 12:32 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: Yes 1 teaspoon
25/06/2025, 12:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also there’s barely any protein here so you ideally want to eat more. 

3 eggs tou hon.
25/06/2025, 12:32 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: Dasi ghee
25/06/2025, 12:32 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: Full or just egg white
25/06/2025, 12:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Full.
25/06/2025, 12:36 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: Ghr ka doodh se fine for a cup of tea?? <This message was edited>

25/06/2025, 1:46 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: Thanks a bunch for guiding 🤍 @923322217301
25/06/2025, 1:50 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: How can we find calories in 10 g low fat cottage cheese?
25/06/2025, 1:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Should be on the packet
25/06/2025, 1:59 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: <Media omitted>
These are the nutritional facts for 100g
25/06/2025, 1:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Divide it by 10 and you'll get the values for 10g :)
25/06/2025, 2:01 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: Ok thankyou
25/06/2025, 2:01 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: And what about 40 g pineapple and 200 g mango
25/06/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: <Media omitted>
What if we didn’t find perfect measurements on MFP, can we weight like this like half cup mango, 1/3 cup pineapple?
25/06/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Are suasuages, bologna slices etc fine to consume specially for kids?
25/06/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Or are these harmful fr kids
25/06/2025, 2:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s always better to check in grams.
25/06/2025, 2:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. Just try that it’s not a majority of their diet
25/06/2025, 2:24 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: So first we can measure grams on scale and check it through MFP
25/06/2025, 2:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
25/06/2025, 2:26 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: A little tip for anyone with pcos: if you have massive cravings like i do, inositol has proven to be a miracle for me ! I’m taking inositol and berberine, i read that inositol can help with cravings and food noise. Its been a major help Allahamdullilah.
25/06/2025, 2:27 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: One more question does it matter if we eat more calories in one time and then we eat less amount of calories in another meal to balance them.
25/06/2025, 2:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Overall daily caloric intake matters 
individual meals do not matter much if you are complying with your overall caloric intake
25/06/2025, 2:28 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: Ok thankyou
25/06/2025, 2:30 pm - PF - Zainab Ahmed: Hey. I have pcos too, you’re right innositol does help, my periods became regular with innositol.
Can you please tell me the dosage of berberine that you are taking because i started with 500mg once daily but it caused me severe diarrhoea..
25/06/2025, 2:31 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Also, is there a number actal grans of protein we can absorb in the body in one single meal?

Like we can have our protein intake divided into two meals like i have to take 130-140 grams of protein

Lets say i have. A meal jisme i take 70grms of protein?  Is it possible?

Ya khaa to mai lu itna protein? But would it be wasted and not optimized in the body

Body bus aik certain amount if protein hi digest kr skti hai in a single sitting??
Any truth to it?
25/06/2025, 2:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no there is not a certain number of protein that your body can absorb at a time 
you can divide as per your convenience
25/06/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: So ur saying even if i am able to consume 140 grms of protein in a single sitting 
Protein shake and a meal 

Body usko completely utilize kre gi
25/06/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I’ve moved up to twice a day now. It does take some getting use to
25/06/2025, 2:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup, lots of positive data behind inositol. Been recommending it since 2019. It wasn’t even available in Pakistan tub. Only recently doctors and all have started becoming aware of it locally. 

Ideal dose for INOSITOL is 2-3g taken 2 times per day.
25/06/2025, 2:44 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Those who dont have pcos but have major food noises n cravings can take that?
25/06/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Can i start taking without a drs prescription
25/06/2025, 2:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes & we have data on it too <This message was edited>

Haleem made with shan easy cook mix
1 kg beef curry 
45 ml olive oil for the whole packet 
how to log 150 grams of haleem
25/06/2025, 3:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this looks like chest not thigh to me but if u know its thigh then fine 
it will be 100ish grams raw 

oil 1-1.5tsp as its BBQ <This message was edited>
25/06/2025, 3:43 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: why do most people recommend cooking in olive oil?
25/06/2025, 3:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): due to its high monosaturated fats content
25/06/2025, 3:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it has less saturated fats

I decided to have pressure cooked rice and chicken for lunch
25/06/2025, 3:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: This is 300g of rice and 300 grams of chicken (with bones). How much would the chicken be without bones (it's half chicken)?
25/06/2025, 3:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: And how much oil should I track for this? Since it's pressure cooked, it's cooked in a lot of water but of course they add oil too in the beginning
25/06/2025, 3:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you weigh it cooked?
25/06/2025, 3:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If so then do 300g raw chicken thigh. 
And add 3tsp oil

25/06/2025, 5:44 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Hello FoMo family! 🌸

I am cooking beef gravy in dinner. Weight is around 750 grams (Estimated, not weighed by scale). I will use 2 tablespoons of pomace olive oil and 3 large tomatoes in making as well.

How to log it into MyFitnessPal as 1 serving? I mean to ask that I will have small portion of it in dinner so how to log it?
25/06/2025, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weigh your portion. Or just divide the total weigh by total portions.
25/06/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: <Media omitted>
Yes dear! Please look into the screenshot attached!
25/06/2025, 5:46 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Which one is correct
25/06/2025, 5:47 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: I don't have a kitchen scale at the moment. Am I supposed to share picture of my plate at dinner time so that you can help me log that in?
25/06/2025, 5:49 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: It depends which one you use. If you have homemade broth then you can choose that from the available options.
25/06/2025, 5:51 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Home made broth out of chiken pcs only
No other ingredients @60193244266
25/06/2025, 5:51 pm - PF - Farah Salman: So y high in cals?
25/06/2025, 5:52 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: <Media omitted>
It's just 14 cal for one cup.
25/06/2025, 6:13 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: @60193244266
25/06/2025, 6:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just search any chicken broth. Won’t be high in calories.
25/06/2025, 6:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this is okay
25/06/2025, 6:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks okay.

@923441183411 bro 45g marble cake. Has 10 choc chips embedded in the top. Store bought. Didn't have any nutrition facts mentioned. Calorie estimate please
25/06/2025, 8:07 pm - PF - Yumna Rehman: While we’re at it
The way I measure that is weigh the slice and then log it in as either “tea cake” or marble cake in MFP
I usually crosscheck from Google 
Please confirm if this method is correct? @923441183411
25/06/2025, 8:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah should be good enough.

Hii guys! 
If you’re struggling with constipation and are using Ispaghol AND dislike its consistency/ texture/ taste- then this alternate is greaaat! 

Its powdery and dissolves in water, so there’s not much of a taste or texture in there.

26/06/2025, 1:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not necessarily and not always.
If you're building muscle mass while losing fat, your BMR will pretty much, more or less stay the same for a while.

That means you won't have to change anything that quickly!

I am pretty sure I had more than 45grams because that was the weight after I had a bite or 2 of it and I am not sure how many calories was that 🤧 any guidance on how much should I log in my tracker and dread it 😂?

26/06/2025, 3:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can track 2oz of chocolate brownie fudge or 50g!
Also, you didn't mess up anything. You ate slightly over the calories we've given you which is your deficit.  I can bet you're still under your maintenance. 
It's prob not as large a deficit, but a deficit nonetheless! :)
26/06/2025, 3:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: 50g cooked chicken

26/06/2025, 4:50 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Hii. Calories of homemade roti and chapati we get outside will be same/ similar? 
I mean can I use the same entry and just adjust the grams?
26/06/2025, 4:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes. Unless that bahir ki roti is basically a sheermaal or a taftan. :p
26/06/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Nooo 😂
The chapati patli wali idk how else to describe that 😂🙈
26/06/2025, 4:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha I know. I get it! 
Calories in atta/flour are practically the same, whether it's used to make roti at home ya bahir.

Are the macros on it authentic, they claim on the packing that it is 24 grams protein per serving

But i cannot find their flavours entry on mfp, so it makes me concerned if its even authentic

26/06/2025, 5:10 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Has anyone tried this brand
26/06/2025, 5:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: MFP doesn’t verify is something is authentic or not. 

Pakistani products aren’t on MFP unless someone adds them
26/06/2025, 5:13 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: then how to add protein 24gms on mfp without its entry in the database?

A single serving will give u anywhere between 20-25 grans protein depending on the brand
26/06/2025, 8:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s your protein target?
26/06/2025, 8:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 650-750.

26/06/2025, 8:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g protein is just 400 calories. So if youre running low on calories then you need to likely cut back on carbs / fats
26/06/2025, 8:50 pm - PF - Samia Najam: calories were almost 1040 before dinner

26/06/2025, 9:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Order one item and ideally stick to that. Paani puri is probably lowest option
26/06/2025, 9:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken breast. Low fat Greek yogurt. Whey protein. 

Lamb and beef are higher in calories.

Correct me if I am wrong…. Divide 503 by 100… and then multiply the answer with the no of grams I am consuming….

27/06/2025, 12:32 am - PF - Maryam Khan: Is it the right way to calculate calories if I want to have a few of these 🥲🥲🥲
27/06/2025, 12:36 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes its the right way 
like 503/100=5.03  so if u have consumed 10g then it will be 50.3 calories n so on

27/06/2025, 12:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: You don't need 130g of protein. Check your Facebook, I responded to your post last night.

Also, if you want to know what you can eat to get that much protein, I'd suggest you read this post on Facebook. I have shared two options #samplemealplan ;

1. 1700-1800 calories and 150g of protein
2. 1200-1400 calories and 100-110g of protein

27/06/2025, 1:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's very hard to tell just by looking at the liquid, so can't be precise honestly. Here's I'd approach this.

- 1litre milk has ~600-650 calories (slightly more based on the fat content)
- With 1ltr milk, you can extract 200-250g cottage cheese (that's around ~500-550 calories)
- And you'll get about 650-700ml whey, that's around 70-120 calories (also has some fat in it)

Hope this helps! You can do the math.
27/06/2025, 1:26 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: How to track 90g restaurant bought shawarma chicken?
27/06/2025, 1:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: How do you think we should?
Give us something so we can guide you.
27/06/2025, 1:27 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: I’m not sure about the amount of oil used but I measured it and it is 90g 🙊 <This message was edited>
27/06/2025, 1:27 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Just chicken
No veggies
27/06/2025, 1:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sure, let's breakdown what all it has?
Name the things you think were added to it that has calories
27/06/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Hot sauce
27/06/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Tandoori masala I guess
27/06/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: And maybe some oil
27/06/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: And maybe a few more seasonings
27/06/2025, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: So the ingredients in a Shawarma that has calories are:
1. Pita bread
2. Chicken
3. Oil
4. Mayo, tahini, or other sauces

That's what you need to track!
27/06/2025, 1:35 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: I just used the chicken
27/06/2025, 1:35 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: No pita, no mayo, no hummus
27/06/2025, 1:35 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Just the chicken
It was total 90g
27/06/2025, 1:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then track 100g raw chicken
1tsp oil
And that's it!

Spices dont have calories
27/06/2025, 1:36 pm - PF - Bisma Ishtiaq: Okay best
27/06/2025, 1:37 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: okay just give ne an idea that if this whey has 70 to 120 g calories and how much the proteins?

27/06/2025, 1:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you're getting their basic version then yes.
If you add a thousand more things then a 6in sub can go upto 700 kcal

27/06/2025, 3:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can be. Though paye should be more fat than carbs.
27/06/2025, 3:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many calories are you on?
27/06/2025, 3:23 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Yes definitely. Cals seemed fine to me. But I couldn’t find a better entry than this? 
Should I let it be?
27/06/2025, 3:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I’d use this. 

@923441183411 what do you think
27/06/2025, 3:28 pm - PF - Maimoona Badar: 1550-1600 but I end up having around 1400 everyday otherwise my carbs intake goes up.

Aap ne aise calculate q kia hai🫣
Im consuming cottage cheese on daily basis
But not entring these calories
27/06/2025, 3:50 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Im using Ali's mentioned calories
27/06/2025, 3:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's not. Lol!

When you make cottage cheese at home (like paneer), you're typically using an acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, right? This is to coagulate the casein proteins in the milk. During this process, the milk fat globules become largely trapped within these protein curds. So even when you strain the curds, you're primarily separating out the liquid whey (which contains lactose and some whey protein), but you're NOT actively "filtering" out the fat that has solidified within the cheese curds.

That's why the fat and calorie content of your homemade cottage cheese will be almost directly proportional to the fat percentage of the milk you start with. If you use whole milk which is what most people use, the resulting paneer will be higher in fat and calories. Always. If you were to make it from skim milk, it would naturally yield a much lower-fat, lower-calorie cheese, simply because there was less fat to begin with.

Commercial level cottage cheese is usually made with either skim milk or low-fat milk, and then they process it even further to make it as low-fat as they can.

Greek yogurt and your topping use butter quantity which falls under your calories
27/06/2025, 3:57 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: thank you mahroz means alot
27/06/2025, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Try to eat more so you’re within your calories. Carbs don’t matter, in fact more carbs mean more energy.
27/06/2025, 3:59 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: @60193244266 @923343773307 please help me log this

27/06/2025, 4:03 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Hey guys, this message may have been missed out, so just topping it up 🫡
27/06/2025, 4:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think it can be tracked as:

Cooked Lentils - 80%
Cooked Meat - 15%
Oil - 5%

@60193244266 @923441183411 kya khayal hai?
27/06/2025, 4:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah somewhat like that. 

I would do it as 70g Cooked lentils, 30g cooked beef or chicken and 5g oil
27/06/2025, 4:11 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: I Dont have a scale right now so can just give me an estimate by looking at the picture ?
27/06/2025, 4:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Those look big so probably 70-80g per piece. 

That would mean 100g cooked beef and 50g cooked lentils. 

Plus whatever oil you used for frying.

27/06/2025, 5:25 pm - PF - Hafiz Anas Raza Barkati: How much in gm
27/06/2025, 5:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro differenr brands have different dosages so just look at the jar/box and use accordingly 
1 scoop for any brand is enough
27/06/2025, 5:27 pm - PF - Hafiz Anas Raza Barkati: Okk sir
27/06/2025, 5:55 pm - PF - Aminah Aziz: Fitfeast. 

They have low carb and hi protein plans and a number of cost options whether you want the meal for a day, two days or three days or a week. However you want it basically.

When it gets too overwhelming for me I subscribe to their hi protein One Meal A Day (OMAD) plan which helps with 50gm of protein per day. And I have the liberty of choosing what meal option I want. Lunch or dinner. I usually go with the one which has lesser calories.
27/06/2025, 6:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Aren’t you just starting workouts for the first time?

27/06/2025, 6:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Still. You’re a beginner. You don’t need pre-workouts honestly. I still don’t use them.
27/06/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Hafiz Anas Raza Barkati: Ok
27/06/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Hafiz Anas Raza Barkati: So any pre-work out meal opt
27/06/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Hafiz Anas Raza Barkati: So what about creatine?
27/06/2025, 6:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s a better use of money.
27/06/2025, 6:45 pm - PF - Hafiz Anas Raza Barkati: Any suggestions of brand
27/06/2025, 6:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on wht you have available.

27/06/2025, 8:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Go through this.
27/06/2025, 8:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bread is usually 3-4g per slice so can be.
27/06/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: do u suggest to take white plain bread instead of bran bread?

Hello jee. Had following for dinner:
120ish gm air fried chicken
105gm cooked rice
Home made mashed potato (made with boiled potato butter and milk) 25gms
Home made moroccan sauce (made with sauces, full fat milk and butter) 30gm

What I tracked 1
27/06/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Aminah Aziz: <Media omitted>
What I tracked 2
27/06/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Aminah Aziz: Okay?
27/06/2025, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both are fine.
27/06/2025, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent
27/06/2025, 9:11 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: <Media omitted>
Does this look ok ?
27/06/2025, 9:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s better if you divide it into 
Ground beef, peas and oil
27/06/2025, 9:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 250g beef with only 15g protein is too low. Especially because peas have some protein too
27/06/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Cyra Inayat: @60193244266
27/06/2025, 9:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. First and foremost calories matter.  

What you eat matters for health though.
27/06/2025, 9:14 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: Should i log cooked ground beef?
27/06/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes it is okay & calorie deficit is the primary thing but you need to understand that these things do not have much interms of the micronutrients and they do not have enough protein they are highly palatable and calorie dense so you can likely endup being in a surplus if u are not mindful

So its better to create a balance. Eat 80-85% of your calories form whole nutritionally rich food & complete your protein intake and the remaining 15-20% can be eaten through these foods it wont be an issue

28/06/2025, 1:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That brown bread entry is wrong. Just add 2 slice of white bread. It’ll be 160-180 calories for 2 slices. 

Also this entire meal will be 20g protein. Not 60g.

28/06/2025, 1:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’re not supposed to add recipes. You’re better off breaking in down into ingredients. 

2 eggs will have the same calories no matter what you do to them. But if you’re using oil to cook then you need to add that oil seperately

29/06/2025, 5:52 am - PF - Bismah Mughal: Hello, just wanted to confirm. The correct way to log cooked chicken pulao is by weighing the rice and logging the exact grams.
Chicken, onions, tomatoes and oil right?
29/06/2025, 6:13 am - PF - Gulalai Anas: Chicken rice n oil
29/06/2025, 6:20 am - PF - Bismah Mughal: Ok thanks

29/06/2025, 1:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The non pressed version will be higher in calories because way more fat
29/06/2025, 2:50 pm - PF - Alina Alam: <Media omitted>
is this accurate for beef pulao?
29/06/2025, 2:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Use 80/20 beef.
29/06/2025, 2:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rest is okay
29/06/2025, 2:53 pm - PF - Alina Alam: what does that mean?
29/06/2025, 2:53 pm - PF - Alina Alam: i weight about 83 g beef and added it separate to the rice
29/06/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ve used 93% beef. Our regular beef is called 80/20 beef. 

Search for that.
29/06/2025, 2:53 pm - PF - Alina Alam: aah okay
29/06/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cooked 80/20 ground beef and add 83g of it
29/06/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Zainab Adil: Hi 
Is there any nutritional difference between types of rice? Like jasmine and basmati? <This message was edited>
29/06/2025, 3:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): they are almost similar nutritionally 
glycemic index of basmati is slightly lower but that doesnt matter much

29/06/2025, 3:59 pm - PF - Aleena Arshad: Okay thank you
29/06/2025, 4:04 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Like making the same dish for my husband and i  for instance if im making chicken pulao i measure my quantity to register calories after cooking? will that work? Or what is the way to go around it since both our macro needs are different
29/06/2025, 4:07 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: <Media omitted>
Had these last night  these are almsot 18 pieces of beef bbg how should i log in this
29/06/2025, 4:08 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: And 1 quarter of poori paratha which was extremely oily 😭
29/06/2025, 4:16 pm - PPF - Shiza Aamir: Same. Will it be accurate if I measure portions after cooking? 

I read somewhere that measurements (for chicken, pasta, rice etc) are only accurate if you calculate them before cooking.

29/06/2025, 4:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Macro / calorie needs are obviously different but you can just divide portions accordingly
29/06/2025, 4:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really.
29/06/2025, 4:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably like 400 raw 80/20 ground beef.
29/06/2025, 4:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And 4tsp oil

29/06/2025, 4:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fine, good option if you want a non whey protein powder
29/06/2025, 4:49 pm - PF - Abdullah Shahid: This 400 raw also calories?

29/06/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Depends on weight and oil 😂
29/06/2025, 5:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depends on how much it weighs and the amount of oil/ghee used
29/06/2025, 5:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 150-160

29/06/2025, 7:45 pm - PF - Daniyal Anees: Qasim?

A general question,
For every beef entry whether its cooked or uncooked we will log  80/20 ground beef 

Is that correct?
29/06/2025, 7:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you are sure that its lean n you dont see marble type pattern on beef then u can log as 90/10 or 93/7 beef but if you are not sure then u need to be at a safe side n log as 80/20 
its always better to overestimate than underestimate
29/06/2025, 9:21 pm - PF - Alina Alam: had 2 eggs in the morning, beef pulao in the evening, greek yogurt, 1 k&n chicken nugget and fruits for snacks and hunter beef on sourdough toast

How would you log a slice of meat lovers pizza ? 🍕
29/06/2025, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. If you used frozen ones then they have flour and oil added to them already. 

If you made them with actual potatoes, then just log potato.
29/06/2025, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks good. 

No cheese?
29/06/2025, 10:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just search dominos or Pizza Hut meat lovers.

30/06/2025, 12:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Subway works well. Any beef burger is usually 550-600 calories.
30/06/2025, 12:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: BBQ options can be great too
30/06/2025, 12:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: One paratha roll will be around 600 calories.

30/06/2025, 2:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you think you've tried everything under the sun to increase your protein intake but can't seem to anymore, without exceeding your calories, then sure.
OR
If you're not getting enough time to prep high protein food for yourself, which is why you can't hit your protein goals, then go for it.

Whey is a convenience food. Helps hit your protein targets easily.
30/06/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: Can a nursing mother take it?
30/06/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Zainab Batool: Because i have same issue and cant prep my high protein food
30/06/2025, 2:42 pm - PF - Yasmin jamil: Thanku
30/06/2025, 2:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes you can. Whey is a by-product of milk. If you can have dairy (milk, yogurt), then you can have whey too

30/06/2025, 6:52 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Tough day today. Just got done with the days' calories! Met the protien target but feel the urge to binge coming on strong. I have binge eating disorder and it is triggered on stressful days and today is an extremely stressful one, made worse by the fact tha I had 3 hours of sleep last night and have been a zombie all day. I hope I can hold off and not destroy the last weeks efforts
30/06/2025, 6:59 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Been there too many times
30/06/2025, 7:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just divide each of those ingredients by 4.
30/06/2025, 7:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And log that portion
30/06/2025, 7:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or you can just allow yourself to not be in a deficit and eat at maintenance for the day. 

That’s a better approach than not planning for it and going over by 1000 calories. 

Also, when you say you have binge eating disorder. Is that a self diagnosis or is that an actual diagnosis? Because if that’s an actual one then are you getting therapy for it?
30/06/2025, 7:09 pm - PF - Sana Akbar: Thank you! 🌸
30/06/2025, 7:42 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Not a self diagnosis. I was formally diagnosed a few years ago. Have been in therapy and on medication on and off. Meds for other issues that trigger the binge eating that is. But I have been off the meds for the last year. Not in therapy at the moment, either. My therapist suddenly became religious, and I wasn't there for that, obviously. <This message was edited>

I was planning my meal for tomorrow and this is the case… 

I can use oil to make the chicken or even air fry it,

If i choose oil to grill the chicken fats will be catered!

Or if i have nuts? Thats a more filling option

Plus how to exclusively have carbs? Without fats?

Lastly?

Agar if i go over board protein thora sa but leave the same amount of carbs in the bank managing overall calories in the same target  as prescribed will that be okay?

Because if i choose to air fry and have nuts instead they will have some fats and protein, also if i have some rice that too will have some protein and carb

So is liye asking that if i stay in the 1850 calories wali range mai
And protein poora ho rha hai/over ho rha hai but at the same time fat ya carb portion manage kr k overall calories same bracket mai rkh lu to its okay right?
01/07/2025, 12:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both oil or nuts are fine. Personal preference hai. 

Carbs without fats? Whole grains, lentils, rice, fruits and vegetables are all carbs. <This message was edited>
01/07/2025, 12:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. You can adjust calories by reducing carbs or fats.

Physiotherapist – Women’s Health Specialist

The night foot pain you’re experiencing after delivery could be due to:

1- Calcium/Vitamin D or Magnesium deficiency

2-Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)
 very common during and after pregnancy.

3- Fatigue or poor circulation


🔸 Consider switching to a supplement with Calcium + Magnesium + D3 (e.g., Caltrate Plus)
🔸 Try warm foot soak + light stretching of calf muscles before bed
🔸 If it continues, get your Vitamin D, Magnesium, and Iron levels checked.

Make them a part of your meals. 

I just had a stir fry which had onions, mushrooms, green onions, eggplant, corn, cabbage and cauliflower

02/07/2025, 10:11 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266, as you mentioned that you cook your own meals, I was wondering do you plan them in advance? I’ve recently started cooking for myself too, but I often have no idea what to make and pora din to decide krne may nikal jata hay.
02/07/2025, 10:25 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: You can use whey protein in smoothies (thank you @923343773307 ) 
Marinate chicken breast in bulk and airfry or bake or cook with minimal oil/ fat. Pair it with fibre (salad or raw or cooked veggies), in snacks you can add edamame. Weigh your marinated chicken and make packs for each meal. You can cook all three together each night for the following day or early morning for the day. Breakfast you can pair with eggs or something. 
Just some ideas.
02/07/2025, 10:45 am - PF - Fatima Ashfaq: Thanku 😊
02/07/2025, 10:59 am - Taha Ahmed: Hi Fatima, welcome to FoMo!
So here are a couple of things you can/should do.

1. Read this post on Facebook where I have explained how/what foods in what quantities you can have to hit your protein targets while staying within your calories. Here's the link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/projectfomo/posts/542848111790138

2. @923322217301 has shared some really nice and easy ideas. You can also do tender pops, nuggets, sausages, etc. Or you can bulk marinate chicken in different flavors. I currently have 3 different marinated chickens in my freezer. I take it out, and sometimes I grill it, sometimes airfry it. That's up to you! You can make your own chicken nuggets/burger patties/fiery fries and use them.

3. If you're struggling to hit protein through wholefoods, then try supplementing it with protein powders like Whey. :) I'm eating 170-180g of protein through wholefoods these days, no protein. You'll just have to make smart, more informed choices around food.

Hope this helps! <This message was edited>
02/07/2025, 11:02 am - Taha Ahmed: We do plan it in advance, but we don't do it on a daily basis, it's more like a weekly effort and what we usually do is we only get the grocery that we know will help us with our nutritional goals. Also, we repeat our meals 5-6 days out of 7, with occasional changes in the spices/marinate. More or less the food remains the same, unless we're eating out, or eating something with the family (for instance, pizza, burgers, etc.)

This way you make it effortless because you don't have to think about what to eat next. You run on autopilot. You don't even waste energy thinking about anything else.

YOU'RE trying to fix each meal separately which is why you end up spending an entire day thinking next meal mai kya khana chahye.

Makes sense?? <This message was edited>
02/07/2025, 11:05 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Batch cook FTW 🙌🏼
02/07/2025, 11:06 am - Taha Ahmed: It works pretty fkcn well, haha!
I'm someone who won't even mind heating up the food, so if there's something I cooked earlier, I eat it as is... directly from the fridge. Esp pastas and sandwiches. IMO, they taste much better when cold. 🙊 hahaha!!
02/07/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: My husband likes cold food too. I honestly don’t understand it. Makes my stomach run! I’m always trying to heat his food and he is forever trying to trick me into NOT.
02/07/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yes, thanks for the insight❤️🙏
Definitely going to try this approach.
02/07/2025, 11:11 am - Taha Ahmed: Well, you should try cold food too. It tastes really good. 😂
Heating up takes so much time sometimes, and I'm almost always running between meetings so I barely get time to sit and eat hot food. 
Eating cold means I eat food atleast. <This message was edited>
02/07/2025, 11:18 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: I can have a cold potato salad. Does that count? Cooked food, if I eat it cold it makes my stomach run. I’ve tried to “fit in” with the elite kids. Failed
02/07/2025, 11:38 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Does anyone know how many calories are there in Nandos Portuguese Lemonade? I hve been googling and cant find it. It doesnt taste very sweet. but since it is spicy, I am assuming the sugar content is hidden.
02/07/2025, 11:42 am - Taha Ahmed: What all's in it?
02/07/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: I gues th emain calories woudl come from sugar. It is just a lemonade with some spices
02/07/2025, 11:43 am - Taha Ahmed: Then atleast 150kcal just like any other lemonade (for 16fl.oz) <This message was edited>
02/07/2025, 11:44 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: It is a sparkling lemonade. I assume they use sprite or 7up as a base. The rest us just a mix of spices
02/07/2025, 11:44 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: How long do u air fry a breast for ? I end up with either dry or then half done
02/07/2025, 11:46 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: I can’t say. I usually bake or grill. For baking in a regular electric oven it take me anywhere between 15-25 minutes. Also depends on your batch. I’ll pay more attention when I make my next batch and let you know

This is what I do. Also, I cook it for max 14-15 mins (flip in half way through). It stays tender and juicy on the inside. Now some may not like it thinking it's raw, but it's not.
02/07/2025, 11:48 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 👍
02/07/2025, 11:48 am - Taha Ahmed: Then track one 350ml 7up

02/07/2025, 1:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search for Starbucks chai tea latte.
02/07/2025, 1:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Mostly just oil.
