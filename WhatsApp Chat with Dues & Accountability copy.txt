09/10/2024, 5:18 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I do have one question regarding it. If I have to add ice coffee made at home. Should I find the closest estimate of my volume of Ingredients or add them separately
09/10/2024, 5:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Adding them seperately will be most accurate. 

What all do you add in your iced coffee?
09/10/2024, 5:21 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Instant coffee one 1 tablespoon 
Stevia 
Half glass water water 
And half whole milk
09/10/2024, 5:21 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: And ice of course 🤣
09/10/2024, 5:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The only thing you need to track in this is the milk. 

Everything else is 0 calorie.

09/10/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): I have one more question 
As i saw workout plan can i know if i can replace them by steps?? Instead of workout can i walk ?
09/10/2024, 10:52 pm - PF - Safwan Jamil: @60193244266 @923343773307 
I do have some questions regarding 3 days strength training 
As from last 2 weeks i have started training my self for 5 km run

Today i have followed day 2 training session in gym, let me draft complete question and will share on fb
09/10/2024, 10:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We recommend that you build your own meal plan and then share it with us and we can recommend changes, if needed.
09/10/2024, 11:05 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
09/10/2024, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes you can but strength training has many benefits such as building muscle, improving bone mineral density and joint health.
09/10/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes please, share it on fb.
09/10/2024, 11:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve added it as an excel sheet in the files section of the Fb group. You can download it from there now.
09/10/2024, 11:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, guys please post your questions in the FB group. 

The WhatsApp is mostly just for announcements since some people might not like the constant notifications on the group. 

Thank you 🤌
09/10/2024, 11:10 pm - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): So can i follow any strength training workouts videos (20-30min) i found that easy to follow. 3 days walk nd 3 days strength workouts? Is that fine?
09/10/2024, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup 👍🏼

I was just going through the food check-ins, and it's a bit tricky to determine if all the entries are accurate.

It looks good overall, but I think we can improve. So when you're sharing screenshots, it would be helpful if you could also include pictures of your meals. This way, both @@60193244266⁩ and I can eyeball the portions and ensure that the entries in MyFitnessPal or MacroFactor match up.
10/10/2024, 12:13 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
@923343773307 just icymi, I posted this on my calorie count post
10/10/2024, 12:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This looks accurate if the chicken is with skin.
10/10/2024, 12:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the weight or size of the chicken too
10/10/2024, 12:16 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: calories in cow milk per 100ml? (Malai removed )
10/10/2024, 12:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: 42-50
10/10/2024, 12:27 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): Same for buffalo milk??
10/10/2024, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, that doesn't make that big of a difference
10/10/2024, 2:14 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Yes it is with skin
10/10/2024, 2:20 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Indeed. The one in the picture is for 750g. They have different marinades and sometimes the size differs by 50g (700g/800g). I was also surprised to see the marinade type also made a difference in calories by as much as +-100 cals. So I take note accordingly and use the Barcode feature on the packet to record accurately for the size/marinade difference.
10/10/2024, 2:20 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: *Barcode feature in Myfitnesspal
10/10/2024, 2:22 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: So far whatever I've scanned I was able to find correct item results
10/10/2024, 2:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Best hai bro
10/10/2024, 2:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also try MacrosFirst. It has AI features as well so it can take a picture of the nutrition facts and make an entry for it
10/10/2024, 3:33 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Hi. 
I have a query, I hope you can answer. I make my meals daily and today I made dal khichri (batch cooking). Using this recipe.
 uncooked mix dal 119g,  boiled white rice 222g
One medium onion
1 TSP ginger garlic paste 
2 small tomatoes
Desi masala
2 tbsp mustard oil

So, the recipe turns out to be a very good portion. And now I measure the cooked khichri once again and one serving is around 150g
How can I measure my macros with such a recipe? 
Do U think this recipe+ ingredients won't be a problem in my weight loss journey?
10/10/2024, 3:35 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: @60193244266 @923343773307 
If you allow me I will share a YouTube channel link where recipes are shared with all the macros calculation.
10/10/2024, 3:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sure, but will have to make sure the macros are accurate.
10/10/2024, 3:42 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: https://youtube.com/@numscakery?si=EMF95P_b1PiC7DXk
10/10/2024, 3:43 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: <Media omitted>
10/10/2024, 3:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s not a problem as long as you are accurately calculating the calories and making them fit. 

As for how to track it. 

I’d go into myfitnesspal and create a recipe with all those proportions you mentioned. 

Then divide it by total number of servings. So that’s how many 150g servings have you divided it into. 

If total quantity is 10 servings then total calories will be divided by 10. 


The other option is just track all those ingredients but divide it by servings. 

So, if you used 119g lentils but made 10 servings then track 12g lentils for one serving and then do this for rice and oil. Can skip tomatoes, onions and masala.
10/10/2024, 3:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh Nums is spot on. I’ve worked with her  in the past and verified her macros.
10/10/2024, 3:57 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: Yes she is too good. Her recipes yummy
10/10/2024, 4:14 pm - PF - Seher khan: I use her recipes too. She is too good.

10/10/2024, 5:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Cod liver oil has a lot of vitamin A, look for omega 3 Fish Oil
10/10/2024, 5:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: And for inositol, look for a brand which has atleast 1000mg
10/10/2024, 5:32 pm - PF - Aroosa Naeem: I have to go to a family gathering today, how should i add/calculate the macros
10/10/2024, 5:38 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: Thankyou. Will again search for it
10/10/2024, 5:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We can estimate (eyeball) them 

Or you can just not track but mentally be aware of portions. 

Focus on protein though.
10/10/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): Hi can i know what is the best age to start taking collagen and is it beneficial?any side effects?
10/10/2024, 6:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you please ask this on the Facebook group

10/10/2024, 7:13 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Hello, 
So, basically I am out for most part of the day because of my job. The easiest meal to get in KL is Mamak. So, daily for lunch I get rice with mixed curry and chicken serving. How can I calculate the calories of this meal?
10/10/2024, 7:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
You mean this? 🤣
10/10/2024, 7:14 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Haha yea exactly
10/10/2024, 7:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Upload a picture of your meal on the Facebook group and I’ll explain how I do it.
10/10/2024, 7:15 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Okayy sure
Tomorrow I'll upload at lunch time. This will be a huge help because eating out really confuses me. 
I have to go to an event on Sunday. And for that one also I don't know how to track calories.
10/10/2024, 7:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In KL, another great option is Ayam tandoori.
10/10/2024, 7:16 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: How many calories in one serving of Ayam Tandoori?
10/10/2024, 7:17 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Is Mamak food really cooked in a lot of oil
Like vegetables deep fried?
10/10/2024, 7:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Uploading a video on this in the group.
10/10/2024, 7:17 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Okayyy sure
10/10/2024, 7:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can be, yes. Egg fried rice and mamak noodles are pretty high in oil content, usually.
10/10/2024, 7:18 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: And the vegetables that they keep separate? Those ones too?
10/10/2024, 9:16 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @60193244266 which flour best for noodle?
10/10/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. Send pictures when you have them

10/10/2024, 11:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re all pretty much the same to be honest. 

Just some minor differences in certain nutrients and fiber
10/10/2024, 11:44 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Ok
10/10/2024, 11:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just search cooked trout or cod and 400g 

Or raw trout around 550g. 

If this had bones and all then remove some weight to account for that

Rice +daal+ vegetables+ mutton lamb and 2 potatoes. How many calories this plate has?
11/10/2024, 1:51 pm - PF - Amna Mir: My question as someone with an ongoig depressive episode who also wants to be consistent with her weight loss journey. How do we make calorie counting easier ? In a way that doesn’t require much mental energy. 

✅ Physical movement is regular and 10k steps are completed daily 
✅ Gym access is available and restarting strength training to help with few of the PCOS symptoms left. 


Thank you ✨
11/10/2024, 1:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Were you not able to weigh the ingredients?
11/10/2024, 1:54 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: No
I don't have the weight machine
How do I get it weighed?
11/10/2024, 2:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to get a food weighing scale for that. Just order the cheapest one you can find. 

For now use:
200g cooked rice
80g cooked lentils
80g cooked lamb
3tsp oil

11/10/2024, 4:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can have Calcium + Vit D3 and Multivitamins. Leave out the middle one as it's just calcium and the first one already has it
11/10/2024, 4:29 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: Both daily?
11/10/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: And what about this?
11/10/2024, 4:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: There are two ways:

1. You can just pick Mixed Veggies entry, mention the serving size (in grams, cups, etc) and track that
2. You can choose the ones that have calories and enter them separately (this can be too tedious so perhaps just stick with the option #1)
11/10/2024, 4:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, ye donon safe range mai he hain

Unless you're eating lots of wholefoods that are already high in minerals and vitamins, then you don't need to take these supplements <This message was edited>

Heya everyone and coaches! @923343773307 @60193244266

 The rest is  weighed but the chicken was cooked earlier ( very simple ingredient like ginger+garlic and soya and chilli sauce) i took 100 gm of chicken and had as lunch! 

Can you explain how should I weigh this chicken as. I cannot find 100gm chicken cooked in macrofirst. 🫥 thank you
11/10/2024, 4:32 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: I have a question can we take creatine monohydrate in black coffe before workout
11/10/2024, 4:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923018502120  this looks good too!

~rabia first time use these multivitamins.
11/10/2024, 4:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: If your diet's lacking veggies and fruits then you can take these
11/10/2024, 4:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, you don't have to, if you're already taking these nutrients from wholefoods :)
11/10/2024, 4:47 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @923343773307 fruits daily zaroori Hain?
11/10/2024, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. This is fine.
11/10/2024, 4:49 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: @923343773307 @60193244266
11/10/2024, 4:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: At least 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit as a minimum goal, to ensure you're getting nutrients like vitamin C, potassium, folate, and dietary fiber (esp fiber)!
11/10/2024, 4:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can but it’s advised to not have creatine and caffeine together. There’s some data to suggest that caffeine interferes with creatine.

11/10/2024, 4:53 pm - PF - Seema Amir: <Media omitted>
11/10/2024, 4:53 pm - PF - Seema Amir: Hi. How do I calculate the calories and protein etc for this. There r 2 pieces of chicken totalling to 100g. Along with that there is spinach and oil in the gravy. Please guide
11/10/2024, 4:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g cooked chicken. 
4tsp oil. 

And then roti.
11/10/2024, 4:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s up to you. Though I recommend pre workout meal be mostly carbs and protein especially if you have it close to your workout time. 

Post workout you can have anything but it’s a good idea to get 25-30g protein in that too
11/10/2024, 5:02 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Thank you so much
11/10/2024, 5:02 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: If we are having something like a palao and don’t know raw Ingridents measurements. Should we estimate the raw ingredients or should we just measure the cooked chicken/mutton separately and cooked rice separately
11/10/2024, 5:04 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Hi
As I'm on this journey of calories deficit... someone told me that it's normal to gain weight before losing when?
Is that correct @60193244266 @923343773307
11/10/2024, 5:06 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Is it okay to track cooked rice and chicken?
11/10/2024, 5:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Measure cooked separately
11/10/2024, 5:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And add an estimate of oil used
11/10/2024, 5:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ummm not really.
11/10/2024, 5:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes, just make sure to use a cooked entry in the app
11/10/2024, 5:08 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): 250 g raw chicken has 53 g protein to hit that how much cooked chicken?
11/10/2024, 5:09 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): And can you pls share cooked rice and chicken entries for mfp
11/10/2024, 5:10 pm - PF - Seema Amir: This 208 calories?with out roti
11/10/2024, 5:12 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: <Media omitted>
I had a half serving of Alfredo in lunch... According to the restaurant these are the caloric breakdown.... Should I need to overestimate?
11/10/2024, 5:14 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266  and @923343773307 i’ve posted questions on the group regarding nutrition calculation. So please let me know
11/10/2024, 5:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just the oil would be 180 calories. So total would be 350-400 without roti
11/10/2024, 5:15 pm - PF - Seema Amir: Ohh okay thanks
11/10/2024, 5:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 185g cooked chicken is 250g raw chicken
11/10/2024, 5:17 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): So when having 185 cooked should i enter 250 uncooked entry or 185 cooked entry
11/10/2024, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not a bad idea. If you had half then maybe use 0.65 rather than 0.5.
11/10/2024, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Both are fine
11/10/2024, 5:19 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): And if taking leg piece or any other part with bone should I estimate bone weight and minus it fron total weight and then enter it or there are accurate entries available
11/10/2024, 5:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: check your post for my response to it
11/10/2024, 5:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can either estimate the bone weight and subtract it, or weigh the whole thing first and then weigh the bones after to subtract for accuracy
11/10/2024, 5:33 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Alright
11/10/2024, 5:37 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): And then use the uncooked breast entry?
11/10/2024, 5:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: This can be worked for both cooked and uncooked meat
11/10/2024, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, that’s what I do.

11/10/2024, 6:55 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: I didn't find it anywhere. I was looking for capsules too
11/10/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: It’s actually really hard to find in Lahore too. Whenever I spot it I grab multiple. Are you in lahore?
11/10/2024, 7:23 pm - PF - Ali Haider: @60193244266 @923343773307 the protein quantity would be different for boneless chicken and the chicken breast?or can we just log them both as boneless Chicken.

11/10/2024, 8:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is fine too
11/10/2024, 8:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is decent too.
11/10/2024, 8:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Powder and capsules are both fine. What matters is being consistent. 

Whatever helps with that.
11/10/2024, 8:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken breast and boneless are going to be the same.
11/10/2024, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also add 2-3tsp of oil as estimate
11/10/2024, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I prefer MacrosFirst or MyFitnessPal
11/10/2024, 9:08 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: How long should I take these?
11/10/2024, 9:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Inositol works over time so you have to consistent for at least 3-6 months with it

Honestly, creating this evidence-based community was long overdue – there’s so much misinformation out there, and we're just glad we can provide a platform that genuinely helps people in the right way.

11/10/2024, 11:10 pm - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): We are glad that u launched it …🙂like Sir Taha said there is so much misinformation… i was fedup eating dry boneless chicken cause our so called dietitians dont have courage to teach us how to calculate calories and eliminate bones weight from chicken 😂but today you teach that in such a simple way i am so thankful for that 👏🏻
11/10/2024, 11:15 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Exactly my previous trainer gave me 4 wings to eat in lunch (each wing size of my pinky finger) I can’t believe i was trying to stick to that plan🙂it was not possible at all. And now I feel like I am having proper meals that keeps me full🥹

12/10/2024, 12:15 am - Taha Ahmed: Thank you!

You know the best part? You're NOT on a diet. You're eating whatever you like/want. This is the way to do fitness.

A lot of people mistake 'dieting' for 'restricting foods,' which it isn't, and try to fit their lifestyle into their diet. We're teaching you how to fit it all into your lifestyle, which is empowering because it teaches you how to do it your way, begair ye feel kiye ke aap koi restriction kar rahay hain.
12/10/2024, 12:31 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: I have always been a yo yo btw all kinds of diet programs! Since the past 20 yrs. I have a love hate relationship with food. 
It's come to a point that I do mindful eating the whole week (caloric deficit btw 1200-1300) , but on weekends I eat something (french fries/ dessert) and then feel extremely guilty over it.
That feeling stays with me for the next 2 days.
12/10/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: I feel pathetic 😔 
E g; I crossed 100 calories benchmark today n it's driving me crazy. Though I behaved really well throughout the past week, both food and exercise wise
12/10/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: I need help with my relationship with food 😭
12/10/2024, 12:42 am - PF - Ali Haider: 100-150 calories doesn't matter much. It can be recovered in the coming days. Overall the weekly caloric deficit should be consistent.
12/10/2024, 1:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That entire piece is 700-800 calories as a best guess.
12/10/2024, 1:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: A normal slice of this is also going to be 400-500
12/10/2024, 1:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100 calories is absolutely nothing. Your daily deficit is 300-500 calories. 

So if you went over by 100, it just means that your deficit is a bit smaller. 

But it’s still a deficit so you’re still losing weight.
12/10/2024, 1:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And even if you go over by 300-500 calories on some days, that just means that on that day you’re just maintaining weight. But the other 5-6 days were a deficit and so you still lost weight over the week.
12/10/2024, 4:11 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): Hi my question is does sleeping pattern effects weight loss results?? As i sleep after fajar wake at zohar i sleep for about 7-8  hours
Once my dietitian said that it will effect my results as i should sleep at night
is that true? <This message was edited>
12/10/2024, 4:13 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): And same goes for eating pattern as i stay up till late night will eating late night effect my weight loss even if i am on caloric deficit??
12/10/2024, 4:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not exactly. 

The most important bit is sleeping 7-9 hours. That covers most of the benefits. 

There are some additional benefits to sleeping when it’s dark but it’s not a do or die situation.
12/10/2024, 4:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely not. Most of my food comes after midnight 🤷
12/10/2024, 1:18 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Is there any good brand for stevia? Or random local koi b
12/10/2024, 1:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Any local brand is fine
12/10/2024, 1:19 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Thank you
12/10/2024, 1:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When it comes to sweeteners, I personally like sucral the most. 

It’s not stevia but tastes better ✌️
12/10/2024, 1:21 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Ohk
12/10/2024, 1:21 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: I never used before
12/10/2024, 1:21 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: So no idea
12/10/2024, 1:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: IMG-20241012-WA0009.jpg (file attached)
This is what I use in Pakistan and have found its taste better than stevia
12/10/2024, 1:22 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: <Media omitted>
Ohk?
12/10/2024, 1:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Canderel is Aspartame
Sucral is Sucralose
Nocal has a Stevia 

They’re all zero calorie and they’re all safe.

They all have different taste so experiment and see what you like the most.
12/10/2024, 1:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is the same thing, but in powder form
12/10/2024, 1:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: The one I shared has tablets
12/10/2024, 1:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but this jar is for baking and cooking 

You can use it in tea but be careful of the amount you use.
12/10/2024, 1:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: I use 1 tablet in 1 cup of tea/coffee <This message was edited>
12/10/2024, 1:23 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: So I should go for tablet
12/10/2024, 1:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ideal for beverages, yes
12/10/2024, 1:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Tablets are easier to use for beverages. Because with the jar you can add too much.
12/10/2024, 1:24 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Yeah only calories that exceed due to sugar and it to hard on my nerves 😬
12/10/2024, 1:24 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Ohk
12/10/2024, 1:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What do you want to use it for?
12/10/2024, 1:24 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Only for tea
12/10/2024, 1:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then try tablets. 

Start with one and if you want to make it sweeter then add 2.

Are artificial sweeteners good for diabetics please?
12/10/2024, 1:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. But just be mindful of calories. 

They’ve recently launched a zero calorie version so that might be better.
12/10/2024, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, artificial sweeteners are zero-calorie, which means they don't raise blood sugar levels, making them generally safe for diabetics.
12/10/2024, 1:35 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Ok SAE
12/10/2024, 1:41 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: @60193244266  what brand of artificial sweeteners would you recommend in the UK please
12/10/2024, 3:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Equal and Splenda

12/10/2024, 8:10 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307, i just wanted to ask you the high bar back squat tends to strain my lower back because of improper form and anterior pelvic tilt, so can i replace that with incline smith machine squats, I’ve been doing them for the past 4 months with a belt and they work for me, so can i just follow that, or are high bar back squats better and i should focus on improving that exercise?
12/10/2024, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s the weight? You can weight them and use chicken breast entry
12/10/2024, 8:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can use smith machine squats or leg press instead
12/10/2024, 8:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Put the cooking spray on the scale, make the scale 0, then spray and put it back. 

It’ll show a negative number. That’s how much you used.
12/10/2024, 8:18 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Thanks, i’ll opt for smith machine squats
13/10/2024, 1:44 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @60193244266 @923343773307 should I post my day 1 workout result on the group directly?
13/10/2024, 1:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can but if you want to post workouts results then maybe do it after the full week is complete. Will have more data to go through that way
13/10/2024, 2:03 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Fair enough. I want to get my form checked out for deadlift. Can I send that to you directly?
13/10/2024, 2:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can post it on Facebook or send it to us directly too

13/10/2024, 9:36 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: I wonder how these myths started in Pakistan 
They all come from doctors mostly
But there's no research really
So how did all of this even start
13/10/2024, 9:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I don’t think it’s doctors.
13/10/2024, 9:37 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: For us Khushi ho chaaye, tension ho chaaye, Kuch b ho solution ha chaaye Tu phir kesay khatam karain chaaye..

13/10/2024, 9:38 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Mostly if we go to doctors, they are the ones advising about all these things 
I've heard so many of them say these things
My dada was actually the one who got me hooked to tea 🫣
13/10/2024, 9:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The chai myth is a special case.
13/10/2024, 9:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Woh kahin aur say ayi hai

13/10/2024, 9:44 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: And every single time I go for a check my first complain from my parents is she drinks too much coffee followed by doctor advising to stop bringing coffee at home. Even when it’s just a viral flu, stop drinking coffee is 1st thing doctors tell me
13/10/2024, 9:46 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: I am addicted to tea 
So many people try to get me off

Then I realized it's not really caffeine that's the problem
Because she has a healthy diet along with coffee

13/10/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Hi @60193244266 @923343773307 
As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety, I please need some motivation to be consistent with calories deficit?
What would you recommend?
13/10/2024, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Honestly, if the problem is depression then I’d recommend getting therapy for that. 

Otherwise any strategy is just hiding the cracks rather than addressing the root cause
13/10/2024, 11:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: IMG-20241014-WA0001.jpg (file attached)
Coach @60193244266 and I grinding in the gym at 2am, to help you hit your goals and get stronger 💪🏽

14/10/2024, 4:57 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): @60193244266 @923343773307  so according to this intermittent fasting helps in fat loss?? Show we combine IF with calories deficit in our lifestyle
14/10/2024, 10:14 am - PF - Safwan Jamil: <Media omitted>
Hello Monday…started my week with a strong weight training sessio
14/10/2024, 11:43 am - Taha Ahmed: @966597223132 so here’s the thing—whether you follow intermittent fasting (IF) or not, weight loss comes down to being in a calorie deficit, meaning you're consuming fewer calories than your body needs. IF just helps create that deficit by limiting your eating window, so many people naturally skip a meal and end up eating less.

People often think weight loss from IF is due to insulin dropping, but that’s not the main reason. When you eat, insulin rises, and when you don’t, it falls—that’s a normal body process. What matters is the overall calorie balance. In fact, insulin will rise and fall whether you’re fasting or not—it’s just the body doing its job and is perfectly normal. The problem would be if insulin doesn’t drop when it should, which is something diabetics deal with, but that's a different conversation. 

IF is really just a tool to help some people stick to a plan. Some find it easier because it structures their eating habits, reduces snacking, or fits into their routine. However, it’s not magic—ultimately, the key is managing calories and finding an approach that works for your lifestyle and energy levels.

I really hope it clarifies any confusion around Intermittent Fasting!

P.S. Yes, you can follow IF too if it allows you to adhere to your plan better!
14/10/2024, 11:48 am - Taha Ahmed: Also, regarding the point he made about fat burning going up when insulin levels drop—yes, that’s true. When there’s less glucose (the body's primary fuel), the body taps into fat for energy. 

However, it’s important to note that *Fat Burning ≠ Fat Loss.*

Just because your body is burning more fat for fuel doesn’t mean you're losing body fat. Fat loss only happens when you’re in a calorie deficit—burning more calories than you consume. If you're not in a deficit, you won’t lose fat, no matter how much fat your body burns for fuel. That’s just basic science!
14/10/2024, 12:12 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: I have this poridge but i throw its packing so how i calcalute its calories
14/10/2024, 12:12 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: <Media omitted>
14/10/2024, 12:21 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: IMG-20241014-WA0003.jpg (file attached)
I use IF for the very reasons mentioned here. Helps reduce snacking and for me personally, I don't have to think too much about what I'm going to have for each meal 😅 since I mostly have either a snack and a meal or 2 meals with a gap in between.
14/10/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just look up oats on MyFitnessPal or a MacrosFirst.
14/10/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re all pretty much the same
14/10/2024, 12:54 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: Ok
14/10/2024, 1:15 pm - PF - Ali Haider: @923343773307 my calorie intake from the calculator was 2450. Please confirm if it's maintenance ones or the deficit. I need to take around 2000 right?
14/10/2024, 1:19 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
14/10/2024, 2:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you make a post on Facebook? I’d recommend you do that so we can look at these numbers and suggest changes if need be.
14/10/2024, 2:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Mention your goals, height, weight and activity levels
14/10/2024, 2:16 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Yes I did. Probably this question got missed in the comments section. That's why I posted here again
14/10/2024, 2:17 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
14/10/2024, 2:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, I missed it! 

Just responded to your comment.
14/10/2024, 2:33 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307 and @60193244266 i wanted to ask you that i refrain from having meat on Monday, so what are alternate sources of protien i can incorporate in my diet for today?
14/10/2024, 2:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Whey, low fat milk, cheese, eggs and Greek yoghurt. 

Even lentils and beans can add up (account for the carbs too)
14/10/2024, 2:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: To add to this^

Tofu, tempeh, seitan (vegan protein sources)
14/10/2024, 2:36 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Oh okay, will look into purchasing these.
14/10/2024, 2:42 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: <Media omitted>
The situation with buying greek yogurt in pakistan
14/10/2024, 2:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahahaahaha punjab has anhaar which is still decent price.
14/10/2024, 2:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Karachi unfortunately has nothing at that price
14/10/2024, 2:46 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Well, i heard about a place called the fruit company that sells greek yogurt desserts, so i’ll check that out
14/10/2024, 3:11 pm - PF - Aroosa Naeem: Truee, it's pretty easy to make it yourself 
I've started making greek yogurt at home since the start of this year and it's been a game changer
14/10/2024, 3:17 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Guys any high protein low calorie dinner idea?
14/10/2024, 3:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: 150-250g chicken tikka, rice/naan and a side of veggies
14/10/2024, 3:24 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Want to hit atleast 60 g protein in  less than 600 calories
14/10/2024, 3:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: 250gm chicken tikka then
14/10/2024, 3:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A tikka is close to 45-50g protein. Add a naan and you’ll still likely be under 600 calories. 

Or add a chapati (even lower in calories)
14/10/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): How many cals in a naan?
14/10/2024, 3:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 250
14/10/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Alright thanks
14/10/2024, 4:18 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307 and @60193244266 I wanted to clarify something you commented on my post, when you said that i should select a weight that allows me to each the lower range of my rep range so that’s 6-8 reps right when the rep goal is 10-12? <This message was edited>
14/10/2024, 4:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If the rep range is 10-12. Then start with a weight that you can hit for 10 reps n
14/10/2024, 4:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Progress to 12 over a week or 2 and then increase weight
14/10/2024, 4:20 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Okay, got it

14/10/2024, 11:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. This is good.
14/10/2024, 11:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ensuring you build muscle. 

Also, making sure that you don’t do a crash diet and loose weight quickly. A gradual approach works better for this.
14/10/2024, 11:04 pm - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): So how many kgs should i aim to lose in a month ?
14/10/2024, 11:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 0.3-0.5% of your weight or so every week is a decent benchmark.
15/10/2024, 2:50 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): Hi i was having sweet craving well i had chocolate just now but a question came in my mind so want to ask can we have desserts or anything we crave to satisfy out sweet tooth on a daily basis?? Or we should take it twice or once a week??
15/10/2024, 4:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can as long as you make sure you’re getting your protein and vegetables in. 

Take care of things that matter for your health first and then if you have calories left, you can definitely enjoy a chocolate.
15/10/2024, 4:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I eat a small 100 calorie chocolate or chips packet almost daily
15/10/2024, 5:50 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): Butter ko melted form mein measure karna hai ya soft ho to bhi scoop out (through measuring spoon)kar k accurate weight(ml) aye ga?? <This message was edited>

15/10/2024, 8:04 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): Should i focus on fiber too ?? Does eating low fiber meals will effect weight loss process??
15/10/2024, 10:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll be the same. You can measure it both ways.
15/10/2024, 10:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No but it can impact health and digestion
15/10/2024, 11:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t necessarily need to track fibre though. 

An easy method is to make sure you’re eating 4-5 pieces of fruit and vegetable per day. 

 For example: 1 apple, 1 carrot, 1 onion, 1 tomato and a bowl of watermelon.
15/10/2024, 3:53 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307 and @60193244266 I’m following the 5 day split and i got legs today. Additionally,  i also got a soccer game at night. So, keeping in mind the soccer game, should I hit legs today or not? Or would that be too much strain on a muscle part for a day?
15/10/2024, 3:54 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Also @60193244266 I’ve also sent you my workout videos on whatsapp, can you just skim through them when you have the time and let me know if the form is right
15/10/2024, 4:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'd recommend doing an upper body session today and rescheduling your leg workout. It would likely put too much strain on your legs, and your performance would probably be affected as well
15/10/2024, 8:46 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307 i’ve reposted my calories on the group, can you please take a look at your convenience
15/10/2024, 9:09 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
How do I know the calories of this biryani? At event so idk about the oil used etc and I ate in a small plate so I don’t overeat
15/10/2024, 9:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'll take a look at it shortly and get back to you.

Just recorded a video and shared our bodyweight and body girth tracking sheet in the group. It should be available to everyone soon.
15/10/2024, 9:29 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Oh okay, thanks
15/10/2024, 9:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Love the plate approach. 

It’s likely around 150g cooked rice and 2.5tsp oil
16/10/2024, 12:11 am - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): @60193244266 @923343773307 if someday i hit extra 20g protein can i decrease protein next day like we can increase and decrease calories and weekly deficit matters so same scene for protein or not?
16/10/2024, 12:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally you want to keep protein the same. 

So if you go over protein, that’s fine. But next day still aim for regular intake.
16/10/2024, 3:24 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): It doesn’t matter if our carbs are high than protein intake?
16/10/2024, 3:25 am - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): <Media omitted>

16/10/2024, 11:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No it doesn’t.
16/10/2024, 11:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You only need a certain amount of protein to get the benefits of it, you’re getting that from the 110g. 

Once that is met, having more is almost pointless. So it’s better to have carbs or fats for remaining calories
16/10/2024, 2:35 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: <Media omitted>
Hey is this possible? Aik tbsp main itni calories?
16/10/2024, 2:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A tbsp of oil is 120 calories

How to approximate calories in a Paratha? I usually eat one or two in a month
16/10/2024, 2:40 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
16/10/2024, 3:02 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: <Media omitted>
16/10/2024, 3:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: A paratha is essentially just a roti with added oil, and the oil contributes significantly to its calorie content.

Here's a breakdown based on 2-3 teaspoons of oil:

 *Calories from oil:* 

2-3 teaspoons of oil = 80-120 calories

 *Calories from the roti (flour):* 

A typical roti (made from 50-60g of flour) = 100-150 calories




Total calories for a paratha:

With 2 tsp oil: 180-230 calories

With 3 tsp oil: 220-270 calories


So, a typical paratha has around 180-270 calories depending on the amount of oil used.
16/10/2024, 3:55 pm - PF - Ali Haider: @923343773307 I weighed it. It was around 216g and only desi ghee was used. It was around 2-3 table spoons.
16/10/2024, 3:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But most people make thicker parathas than rotis so calorie can be 350-400. 

Since, you have it 1-2 times a month. I’ll just account for it and move on
16/10/2024, 3:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: PTT-20241016-WA0018.opus (file attached)
16/10/2024, 3:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Whaaattt? That’s quite a big paratha. Are you sure it was 216g?
16/10/2024, 3:56 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Yes actually! 😅
16/10/2024, 3:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then probably 800-1000
16/10/2024, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A frozen dawn paratha is 85g I think
16/10/2024, 3:58 pm - PF - Ali Haider: My estimate was around 916 cal. Since I have to eat around 2400 so I thought to experiment a little bit
16/10/2024, 3:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s a decent estimate
16/10/2024, 3:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But think of it this one paratha was equal to a Macdonalds burger and small fries 🤣
16/10/2024, 4:00 pm - PF - Ali Haider: But nothing beats paratha with chai!! 😂
16/10/2024, 4:04 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: @60193244266 sir how we will calculate before kneading the flour or after like pera
16/10/2024, 4:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ideally, before kneading because some people add oil during kneading as well
16/10/2024, 4:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is going to be most accurate
16/10/2024, 4:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Otherwise we can guesstimate afterwards
16/10/2024, 4:06 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Ok I got it
16/10/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Sir jalebi ka kia portion ho ga? MacroFirst aap main just one serving show ho raha gram main nhi hai
16/10/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Amna Awais: <Media omitted>
12g
16/10/2024, 4:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d estimate 120-150 calories and move on
16/10/2024, 4:17 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Thank you
16/10/2024, 4:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just sharing my way of tracking jalebi (for educational purposes), as it's primarily made up of sugar (carbs) and oil (fat).

Here's the breakdown:

6g carbs x 4 kcal/g = 24 kcal
6g fat x 9 kcal/g = 54 kcal

Total = 78 kcal

You could also just track whatever and move on like Sameet said, but if you're a number nerd like me, this approach could work too 😅
16/10/2024, 4:53 pm - PF - Humaida: @60193244266 @923343773307 
I make cottage cheese at home with low fat milk ( 106 cal / 250ml ). On myfitnesspal low fat cottage cheese is 76 cal per 100g, would that be accurate 'cause i dont know how i'd calculate the calories for this.
16/10/2024, 4:55 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Is calculation method se dil ko tasalli ho gi
16/10/2024, 4:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Just use that. Not a big different.
16/10/2024, 5:48 pm - PF - Humaida: Alright thanks!
16/10/2024, 6:14 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 how do i measure calories for foods like chicken cury and rice
16/10/2024, 6:14 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: <Media omitted>
Something like this
16/10/2024, 6:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Measure the rice. 
Add that. 

Measure the chicken and the potato and add oil estimate. 

So for example:
200g cooked rice
50g potato
Chicken 100g
3tsp oil
16/10/2024, 6:20 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Well, i should have done it before my meal, now might have to rough estimate it based on the 20% rule
16/10/2024, 6:21 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Sir all kind of oils have same equal calories 1 tbsp =120
16/10/2024, 6:22 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: ?
16/10/2024, 8:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
16/10/2024, 8:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
16/10/2024, 9:44 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Assisted pull ups Alternative exercise please?
16/10/2024, 9:45 pm - PF - Minahil Kashif: Lat pull downs 
Bent over rows are some alternatives but @60193244266 @923343773307 will confirm
16/10/2024, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Lat pulldowns.
16/10/2024, 10:05 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: <Media omitted>
How can a shawarma in a saj wrap have 1000 calories? Does this make sense
16/10/2024, 10:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It can. Garlic sauce is super high in calories.
16/10/2024, 10:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus the chicken tenders are deep fried.
16/10/2024, 10:07 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: But they barely put any I saw 😂
16/10/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A regular shawarma doesn’t have fried chicken
16/10/2024, 10:08 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: Yeah this is just sad
16/10/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha 

I’d still go with their calorie count. But 1000 for a wrap is insane. 

People can eat two of these in one go. 2000 calories in a meal. Add a drink 🤯🤯
16/10/2024, 10:09 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: I knoww I was hungry even after having 1
16/10/2024, 10:12 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: <Media omitted>
How many calories would this have?
16/10/2024, 10:12 pm - PF - Minahil Kashif: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DA3VUkgIkPG/?igsh=d3c0MDhodHcwam9v

Agar mein eik chay hoti mein calories k naam per ye order kerti. Mighty zinger k baad 4 katray bye bye cals
16/10/2024, 10:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol
16/10/2024, 10:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 850-1250 depending on serving size
16/10/2024, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fries are easy to track, just use McDonald’s li entries (small, medium or large based on serving size)
16/10/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: Yeah I was going to ask you this.
16/10/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: Sounds good.
16/10/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: It’s so difficult to maintain like if I’m supposed to have 1600 calories in a day then meals like these would just ruin my day.
16/10/2024, 10:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s where eating out a lot can be problematic because restaurants don’t care about calories. 

The goal is to make food delicious and that usually means high calorie food. 

Also, one reason why obesity rates keep going up.
16/10/2024, 10:46 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: Also, if im consuming 2000 calories for example but im exercising so im burning calories too right? So if i lose 300 calories at the end of the day im doing fine?
16/10/2024, 10:47 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: Just wondering 🤔😂
16/10/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui: Also, I’m not sure how accurate are these Apple Watches. Lol. Like they show im losing 300ish calories when I do like 14k steps or something. I don’t know if that makes sense.
16/10/2024, 10:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The 1600 takes movement into account. 

Plus a proper workout burns 150-200 calories AT BEST.
16/10/2024, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re pretty accurate when it comes to heart rate or steps. 

But calories aren’t even close. I personally never look at that number. Just use them to make sure I’m getting my steps in.
17/10/2024, 12:48 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @923343773307 n @60193244266  Aslam o alikum.kal stomach infection ki waja say nestle yoghurt aur pediatral water istamal ki tha.so no calories update
17/10/2024, 12:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine. When not feeling well, the focus is on recovery and getting better. 

Try to keep yourself hydrated and eat whatever you can digest.
17/10/2024, 12:52 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Shukarya 🙂
17/10/2024, 12:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Hey everyone, I know I have a lot of messages and comments to respond to, and I’ll get to them tomorrow.

Not feeling my best today, so I’m taking the night off.

See you soon! 🙏🏽
17/10/2024, 12:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Or you can ask Sameet if it's urgent

How many approximate calories in this, it’s  a pistachio milk cake slice and a chicken bread
17/10/2024, 4:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 450-500ish is what I’d estimate it at
17/10/2024, 4:30 am - PF - Gulnaz: For both or just the cake slice
17/10/2024, 9:45 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both. I’m saying this cause the slice looks small
17/10/2024, 9:58 am - PF - Gulnaz: Gotcha
17/10/2024, 1:03 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Just a question. If 1 tea spoon of sugar is only 16 calories, can it be a part of a regular diet if it's under the caloric limit? Will it have negative effects on health like cholesterol etc.?
17/10/2024, 1:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse, it can be a part of your diet.
17/10/2024, 1:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is exactly why the sugar fear-mongering makes no sense. 

If your diet is full of sugar then that’s a problem but if it’s just a few (100 or so calories) then there’s absolutely no problem. 

If you’re getting your protein, fiber and other nutrients in then yeah remaining calories are mostly energy anyway.
17/10/2024, 1:11 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: How many calories in two homemade chicken shami kebab? <This message was edited>
17/10/2024, 1:15 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: <Media omitted>
17/10/2024, 1:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Does it have daal in it or just chicken?
17/10/2024, 1:34 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Yeah egg,dall and chicken
17/10/2024, 1:36 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: If I have to take total 117 g of protein 93g toh ye hi hai😀😳if m not wrong
17/10/2024, 1:37 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Remaining only 24g left
17/10/2024, 1:41 pm - PF - Ali Haider: 100g of chicken will have around 25-30 grams of Protein.
17/10/2024, 1:41 pm - PF - Ali Haider: 1 Egg around 6-8g.
17/10/2024, 1:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is 117 of chicken and daal. Not 117g of protein
17/10/2024, 1:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup.
17/10/2024, 1:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ll divide this into 60g chicken and 33g cooked lentils
17/10/2024, 1:48 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Ohk I got it now
17/10/2024, 1:49 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: What about calories?
17/10/2024, 1:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: An egg has about 70 calories
17/10/2024, 1:49 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Ohk
17/10/2024, 2:28 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Is it only me or my fitness pal is glitching today? It keeps logging me out

17/10/2024, 2:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But maybe someone else can confirm
17/10/2024, 2:49 pm - PF - Parishy Noor: It happened with me yesterday…
17/10/2024, 2:50 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I think it’s because of internet situation and all the other apps glitching in Pakistan
17/10/2024, 2:52 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: <Media omitted>
I had this slice of pizza. How should I log it? Don’t know about the calories in it. I tried to find on cafe’s website but couldn’t. It’s coffee bean’s margherita pizza
17/10/2024, 3:17 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I use an average of 265-300 calories/100g slice for every type of pizza.
@60193244266 or @923343773307 please confirm?
17/10/2024, 3:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use dominos for track similar style pizza.
17/10/2024, 3:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So 250-350 per slice for a standard style pizza is a decent estimate.
17/10/2024, 3:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll find all dominos entries on MyFitnessPal
17/10/2024, 3:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, I’d just track the Domino’s pizza and if you’ve added extra toppings, you can log those separately. But typically, I keep it simple and track the closest entry I can find.

17/10/2024, 3:50 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: <Media omitted>
Should I log this one? As 2 slice though I had one but just in case? It was a very small slice tho and had just a lil bit of cheese, thin crust, jalapeños and chicken
17/10/2024, 3:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe find a chicken pizza cause that’ll have more protein too. 

Or just track 1.5-1.75of this one.
17/10/2024, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hey. Please go read the pinned posts on the Facebook group

17/10/2024, 5:51 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: Hello @923343773307 and @60193244266
As of now I follow a Push Pull Leg split with an added arm day 

Can i edit the document according to my split and update it regularly?
17/10/2024, 5:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, you can.
17/10/2024, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why this specific split though? Do you want to focus on your arms specifically?
17/10/2024, 6:00 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: Not necessarily,
I usually hit biceps and triceps at the end of my push and pull days but I feel i can’t perform those sets at the intensity that i want to

So, after PPL and arm day i take a day off and repeat this split 

I’ll edit the doc sheet with all my sets and weights then share it asap
17/10/2024, 6:04 pm - You changed this group's icon
17/10/2024, 6:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t need to share it if you are just using it to track progresss.
17/10/2024, 8:22 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Kari pakora ko kis trah track kr skte hain?
17/10/2024, 8:23 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: Same question✌️
17/10/2024, 8:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just estimate 40ish calories per pakora.
17/10/2024, 8:23 pm - PF - Amna Awais: <Media omitted>
17/10/2024, 8:24 pm - PF - Amna Awais: N how much kari?
17/10/2024, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the portion. 

If you have 200g of it. 

I’d estimate 50g of gram flour (chickpea flour), 50g yoghurt and 3tsp oil
17/10/2024, 8:25 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Do we have to calculate calories of soy sauce and other sauces while cooking?
17/10/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can. It’ll have 20-30 calories at best. You can estimate it too.
17/10/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Vinegar, hot sauce and mustard are zero calories so you can skip those
17/10/2024, 8:26 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Yeah I just used few drops so I guess it’s okay not to
17/10/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: That’s great
18/10/2024, 5:26 am - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): @60193244266 @923343773307  i had a burger yesterday from KGB and now am confused how would I login the calories 🫥 can you please assist? 

It was a grilled chicken burger.
18/10/2024, 5:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search grilled chicken burger from Burger King
18/10/2024, 9:36 am - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): May I know what is a 1 serving of the fruit?
18/10/2024, 9:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Of what fruit?
18/10/2024, 11:18 am - PF - Aroosa Naeem: <Media omitted>
@60193244266 @923343773307 estimated calories 
It's with cibatta
18/10/2024, 11:27 am - Taha Ahmed: I’ve had that sandwich too, and honestly, it felt like it had a secret stash of extra calories hiding in there! 😅 The mayo was definitely working overtime. 

If I don’t want to stress about it, I’d track 1225 calories and call it a day. But if I’m really playing it safe (you know, just in case that sandwich had ambitions of being a 5000 calorie meal), I’d add an extra 5-10% for good measure—because sandwiches like this always have a sneaky way of packing more than you expect! 😆

So 1225 x 0.05 (5%) =1290 kcals
18/10/2024, 11:34 am - PF - Aroosa Naeem: .______.
18/10/2024, 11:35 am - PF - Aroosa Naeem: War gaye

Yolo 🥲😅
18/10/2024, 12:38 pm - PF - Aroosa Naeem: @923343773307 how should i enter this in mfp?
18/10/2024, 12:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay, so my brain was clearly on autopilot earlier—fever must’ve been in charge because I somehow thought the price was the calories (yes, I know, not my best moment 🤦‍♂️). 
Fever: 1, Me: 0. 😅

But here’s the fix: Search for “Grilled Chicken Ciabatta Sandwich” on MyFitnessPal, and instead of going for the lowest calories, pick the entry with the most. If you see options ranging from 600 to 950 calories, go for the 950 one! It’s always safer to overestimate, esp when trying to lose weight.

And then search for "Pan Fried Potato Slices" and add 30-40g.
18/10/2024, 12:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: I took a closer look at the image you shared, and it’s looking more like a 900-1000ish calorie meal! 😅 The mayo situation actually seems under control this time—no sneaky overload here. <This message was edited>

For this is this estimate okay  half brownie and icecream whole
18/10/2024, 1:12 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Chocolate brownies have around 350-450 calories per 100gm. To be safe, it looks like around 80 gm so it's easily over 300 calories.

Ice cream looks fine. Is it right @923343773307 ?
18/10/2024, 1:14 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): 300 calories for whole brownie or for half?
18/10/2024, 1:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, that's right.

This looks like a 80g brownie and 1 scoop of ice cream (typically 60-70g). 
80g brownie = 240-250 kcal
60g icecream = 130 kcal

total kcal = 120 kcal (40g brownie) + 130 kcal (1sc icecream) = 250ish kcal
18/10/2024, 1:21 pm - PF - Ali Haider: My guess was for the whole brownie which was in the picture.
18/10/2024, 1:25 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Oh okay thankyou
18/10/2024, 1:26 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Tips on how to leave the gym after leg day? 😂
18/10/2024, 1:38 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Ditto! 😅
18/10/2024, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ah, the classic leg day struggle! 😅
18/10/2024, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: I guess the only way is to embrace the penguin walk 😂
18/10/2024, 1:45 pm - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): Dragon fruit! White
18/10/2024, 1:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Or... use all the available surfaces, walls, rails, or random people haha, whatever helps you make it to the exit
18/10/2024, 1:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1 serving of dragon fruit is typically around 100 grams or about half a medium-sized fruit
18/10/2024, 1:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's also true for most fruits.
A standard serving size is typically around 80-150 grams or about one medium-sized piece (like an apple or orangee)
18/10/2024, 1:49 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): I wanted to ask this too you said  try to have 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables so like 100g 100g is one serving or one serving is based on calories
18/10/2024, 1:50 pm - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): Alrighty!!! Perfect!
18/10/2024, 1:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Great question! When I mention aiming for 4-5 servings of fruits and vegetables, each serving is generally around 100-150 grams (or one medium piece for whole fruits), not necessarily based on calories. This way, you’re getting a variety of nutrients and fiber, which is more important than just counting calories. Think of it as a guideline (not a scripture) to help ensure you’re incorporating a range of colorful, nutrient-dense options into your diet!

Here's an example for everyone in this group of what 4-5 servings of fruits and veggies could look like:

1 medium apple (about 150g) – 1 serving of fruit
1 medium carrot/cucumber (about 60g) – 1 serving of vegetables
½ cup mixed berries (about 75g) – 1 serving of fruit
1 medium banana (about 120g) – 1 serving of fruit
1 cup steamed broccoli/zucchini/cauliflower (about 150g) – 1 serving of vegetables

That's 5 servings - 3 fruits and 2 vegetables.

Hope it helps improve your intake! 🙏🏽
18/10/2024, 1:56 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Thankyou so much for the detailed answer understood
18/10/2024, 1:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse. We're here to help. 🙏🏽😊
18/10/2024, 1:58 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Do potatoes have fiber?
18/10/2024, 1:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g (raw) has around 2g or so I think
18/10/2024, 2:06 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Don't go to gym on leg day!! simple!! ... 🤓
18/10/2024, 7:22 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Hi @60193244266 @923343773307.... is it okay to track calories per week e.g. I'm on 1400 calories and yesterday I had 2500 calories because of biryani... so today I'm only having 300 calories for lunch and that's all
18/10/2024, 7:24 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Basically, having high calories one day and fasting the next
18/10/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Maha Zakir: <Media omitted>
Hello! Approximately how much calories in this pastry?
18/10/2024, 7:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can but I’m not a fan of that approach. Cause you’ll be starving the next day and there’s a chance you go overboard.

I usually just go back to my usual calories the next day if something like this happens. 

One day doesn’t make that big a difference.
18/10/2024, 7:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 450-600 is a decent estimate

19/10/2024, 12:21 am - Taha Ahmed: Around 225-240
19/10/2024, 12:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Half naan -125
1tsp oil

How to track allo naan..i am sure its not 300
19/10/2024, 3:39 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Naan has around 250 cal + boiled potatoes 50g (around 50-70 cals) so 300 is a good estimate. Rest @923343773307 can confirm!

Around how many calories would be in one sachet of these
19/10/2024, 4:01 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
19/10/2024, 4:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah exactly. Not a bad estimate but you can use 1.25 of the serving to overestimate if you feel it’s higher or has extra oil
19/10/2024, 4:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Must be written on each sachet or the back of the box.
19/10/2024, 4:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup

These are "pie in the sky's" chocolate drizzled cinnamon sticks.
How many calories in each stick? Plz guide
19/10/2024, 5:04 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: <Media omitted>
Any of these?
19/10/2024, 5:39 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Hard to guess. But from the pie in the sky website the ingredients include puff pastry, brown sugar, cinnamon powder and icing sugar. Net weight is 200gm per bag.

So total calories (without chocolate) should be in between 750-850. Divide it by the total number of sticks.
 Add around 70-100 calories for chocolate per stick.

That should give you a rough estimate.

19/10/2024, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So sorry for this, how did it happen? 

3 weeks isn’t that long. You’ll be back on your feet before you know it. 

Focus on eating maintenance calories and protein. Both those should help fast track the healing process.

20/10/2024, 2:04 am - Taha Ahmed: Really sorry about that! Hope you're taking care of yourself now. 

It's okay if you can't workout ATM, focus on recovery. 

You'll be back at it in no time. And no, I'm not just saying it. 

I can actually understand how it feels when you're injured and aren't able to exercise because of it or anything else for that matter. 

Wishing for your speedy recovery! 🙏🏽🌻

20/10/2024, 2:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Approximately. 

It can be anywhere between 430-470 calories.
20/10/2024, 2:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d do 100g cooked chicken
10g oil
7g butter
10g cream

Any idea what else went into it?
20/10/2024, 2:19 pm - PF - Maha Zakir: I have no idea at all🫠
20/10/2024, 2:19 pm - PF - Maha Zakir: Maybe yogurt
20/10/2024, 2:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just go with this
20/10/2024, 2:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Increase cream to 15g
20/10/2024, 2:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100g+10+15+7 =132 g

20/10/2024, 4:37 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I would have just eaten it and then pretend that I didn't. That helps staying in a caloric deficit!.. 😅
20/10/2024, 4:41 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: lol i just started sticking to 1600 calories a day so I’m trying to stay within it😭I was trying but it was hard but I have figured out now so I don’t wanna mess up
20/10/2024, 4:42 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: For me weekends are so easy because I wake up at 4pm and spend rest of the day in panic that I haven’t done enough work and forget to eat. It’s the week days when I am out all day long 🥲so calorie banking on weekends makes it a lil easier for week days
20/10/2024, 4:48 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Calorie banking certainly helps. I wish I knew this concept before I started my fat loss journey

21/10/2024, 9:07 pm - PF - Um Hashir (Iqra Ilyas): Hi i want to know what kind of rice is better? In one case if we boiled and stain the water this is better to have or the one which is cooked on its own water?
21/10/2024, 9:20 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: Laddo peethi😅... Any idea how to estimate it's calories
21/10/2024, 9:27 pm - PF - Ali Haider: That is some PhD level stuff! 😅.

If you know about the recipe then it can be estimated.
I found one online 

https://foodfusion.com/recipe/laddu-peethi/

Using the ingredients we can estimate the calories.
21/10/2024, 9:28 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: Thank you.... It was just impulsive street food munching while shopping
21/10/2024, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Honestly doesn’t matter much. 

Starch has a lot of benefits and can help you feel fuller too.
21/10/2024, 9:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I didn’t even know this exists hahahaha first time I’m hearing about this food
21/10/2024, 9:31 pm - PF - Ali Haider: You must be too rich for this! 😅
21/10/2024, 9:44 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): mashAllah 🤣 Kuch reh na jaye

21/10/2024, 10:07 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Yes most common in Lahore. Even I got introduced to it just last year  when I stayed there
21/10/2024, 11:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both are decent brands but you need 2-4g per day. So 4-8 capsules

22/10/2024, 8:10 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Help me with the calorie count for these
22/10/2024, 9:58 am - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
I'd multiply it with 1.25 to approximate around 60 calories
22/10/2024, 9:59 am - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
Amul nankhatai seems like a close estimate.
(374/100)*18 should be around 70 cals
22/10/2024, 10:00 am - PF - Ali Haider: @923343773307 or @60193244266 please confirm!
22/10/2024, 10:01 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Thank u one more thing I am starting  from today currently  at 86 with 5 '1 height no gym near me what should be the basic start for workout and stamina building
22/10/2024, 10:04 am - PF - Ali Haider: @923343773307 or @60193244266 will guide about this. They are the designated experts in this field
22/10/2024, 11:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Not a bad estimate
22/10/2024, 11:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you seen the workout sheet? It has home workouts too
22/10/2024, 11:23 am - PF - Seher khan: Ohhh. Even I thought it was just gym workouts. So haven’t been doing any exercise 😔
Will check the sheet today.
22/10/2024, 11:38 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Can't open links in workout  program  may be due to Android  phone
22/10/2024, 11:38 am - Taha Ahmed: Hi @923014593333 and @923332078732, tagging you both again in a post with a video that explains how to use the training sheet.
22/10/2024, 11:42 am - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
There are 5 workout plans in total (look at the bottom)
22/10/2024, 11:42 am - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
If for any reason you can't make a copy of the sheet for your own use, you can download it from the Files tab in the group
22/10/2024, 11:47 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I might sound dumb but I can't open links or references for body measurements  in these files🙁
22/10/2024, 11:48 am - Taha Ahmed: Is there any error you're getting? Can you share a SS?
22/10/2024, 11:49 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): <Media omitted>
By clicking the workout  I get this
22/10/2024, 11:49 am - Taha Ahmed: You probably don't have a browser installed on your phone. Looks like you're using an android. Go to the Google Play Store, download Google Chrome and this should work for you then
22/10/2024, 11:50 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I have chrome  for android  but still ....np I will search on it and do workouts 💪
22/10/2024, 12:05 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: That is quite strange. I'm using an android phone and when I tap on the link, it takes me to YouTube app directly
22/10/2024, 12:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Maybe it's opening up within the specific application web browser and possibly why you can't access it
22/10/2024, 12:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Try it on your laptop and see if you're still experiencing this issue
22/10/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
22/10/2024, 12:19 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: You may want to try this and see if it resolves the issue @923332078732
22/10/2024, 3:29 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Hi
Is it okay to exercise right after eating?
22/10/2024, 3:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Depends. If you don't feel pukey/sick, then yes, there's really no harm in exercising after eating. Just don't do any high intensity exercises or you'll actually throw up
22/10/2024, 5:52 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Is anyone using mfp premium? useful?
22/10/2024, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. You don’t need it
22/10/2024, 6:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: MacrosFirst alllows you to do everything MFP premium lets you do FOR FREE.
22/10/2024, 6:46 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So many times, i have headaches after exercising, even if it is a light session...is there any solution for that?
22/10/2024, 6:48 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Normally I have to eat something sweet and that's helps me
22/10/2024, 6:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you generally eaten before the workouts?
22/10/2024, 7:28 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Pls send the links for the workout sheets , unable to open them through Facebook
22/10/2024, 7:30 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Yes, normally I do eat before

23/10/2024, 1:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d say try having a lower fat meal
23/10/2024, 9:39 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Thank u it worked 🙏
23/10/2024, 11:43 am - PF - Umamah Abbasi: <Media omitted>
How do I know the calories of this? This isn’t cream but banana milk shake. Also, 2 tsp sugar was used in the dish in total. Apple, banana and grapes and 2-3 walnuts.
23/10/2024, 11:44 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you weigh the total dish by any chance?
23/10/2024, 11:52 am - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Unfortunately no
23/10/2024, 12:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then I’d do 100g banana
50g grapes
30g apple
150ml
Milk
1tsp sugar or less (if total serving was a lot)
2-3 walnuts
23/10/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Aoa @60193244266  once you have told in group the calorie of one fritter count 40 k/cal

23/10/2024, 1:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fritter?
23/10/2024, 1:58 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Pakoray
23/10/2024, 2:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah 40 isn’t a bad estimate for one.
23/10/2024, 5:34 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): Calories in 58g of roghni naan. It has 158 calories according to mfp
23/10/2024, 5:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Usually a 80g naan is 250.
23/10/2024, 5:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So 58g is 3/4 of it?
23/10/2024, 5:43 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): Quarter of whole naan
23/10/2024, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then 80-100ish should be good enough
23/10/2024, 6:52 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: Hello 
@60193244266 
@923343773307 

Chronometer says that a Kfc zinger has 220 calories and 15g protein 

While 8 Nashville wings have 1065 cal and 40g of protein 

Is this accurate?
23/10/2024, 6:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
23/10/2024, 6:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A zinger is about 570 calories
23/10/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: Okay
And the macros?
23/10/2024, 6:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Zinger is close to 30ish
23/10/2024, 7:01 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: Okay
Thank you

24/10/2024, 12:04 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: How many calories would be in this sandwich? It’s italian chicken sandwich by coffee bean. It has chicken, cheese, pesto, tomatoes
24/10/2024, 12:04 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: And if we also consider the lettuce, peanuts and sundries tomatoes on side. How much would be the total
24/10/2024, 12:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: @60199004077 brought up a great question, and it's something I was planning to cover in a video, but I couldn’t resist responding since she asked in the group!

*Context:* How to prevent feeling hungry while trying to lose weight.

Feel free to check out my response in the link below, as it might be really helpful for many of you on your weight loss journey.

https://www.facebook.com/share/p/a3iE6VDde12qTwfU/
24/10/2024, 12:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: So here's what you have in your sandwich:
Chicken (1 grilled breast): ~180 calories
Cheese (mozzarella 1 slice): ~90 calories
Pesto (1 tbsp): ~80ish calories
Tomatoes (2 slices): not counting
Bread (looks plain): ~220 calories

Sides would be:
Peanuts (small handful, 0.7 oz): ~130 calories
Sundried tomatoes: ~20ish ? calories

Total would be around: ~720 calories
24/10/2024, 12:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Here^
24/10/2024, 12:25 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Alright thank you
24/10/2024, 12:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: You're welcome! 😊
24/10/2024, 12:30 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: The chicken wasn’t generous to be honest
24/10/2024, 12:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: 90-100g tou hoga?
24/10/2024, 12:31 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Yeah I guess it’s was boiled so may be that’s why it felt lighter
24/10/2024, 12:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks a like a fillet (chicken breast)
24/10/2024, 12:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: why boiled? :o
24/10/2024, 12:32 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Boiled and then grilled I mean it has grill marks but seemed like boiled inside
24/10/2024, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, most cafes/restaurants poach chicken in the morning and then only grill it before serving, so it makes sense
24/10/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Oh makes sense
24/10/2024, 1:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Some of you haven't adjusted your calories and macros in MyFitnessPal app

Posted a video showing how you can change it

24/10/2024, 6:31 pm - PF - Suleman Sadiq: I have a query.
How to deal with the cramps during or after the workouts.
How can one avoid them. Though I was drinking enough water throughout the day.
24/10/2024, 6:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's not always the hydration, could be due to a lack of electrolytes (like sodium, potassium) or even calcium. Try eating a banana 30 minutes before your workout and see if it helps!
24/10/2024, 6:36 pm - PF - Suleman Sadiq: Ok 👍🏼
24/10/2024, 6:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Also, adequate warm up if the cramps persist
24/10/2024, 6:55 pm - PF - Suleman Sadiq: Ok. Someone suggested to take ORS. Does that help?
24/10/2024, 7:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it's got electrolytes, so yes.
24/10/2024, 7:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: IMG-20241024-WA0007.jpg (file attached)
Electrolytes plus sugar, around 20gm
24/10/2024, 7:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: It may help with your performance too
24/10/2024, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Maybe try Gatorade or other sports drinks
24/10/2024, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: But also be mindful of the calories
25/10/2024, 12:30 am - PF - Mariya Rehan: Calories in a beef cheese burger?
25/10/2024, 12:33 am - Taha Ahmed: @923452203212 Plain Beef Cheeseburger has approx. ~550-650 calories (depending on the fat content of the beef... the estimates I've given is for 80/20 ground beef)
25/10/2024, 12:34 am - Taha Ahmed: 1 Beef patty - 4oz or 115g
1 slice of cheese
Burger bun
Ketchup, mustard, mayo
25/10/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Mariya Rehan: Alright. Thanks!!
25/10/2024, 12:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is without cheese.
25/10/2024, 12:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For burgers I just use a much easier method
25/10/2024, 12:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If I’m having Any single patty beef burger (plain)
25/10/2024, 12:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ll track it as a quarter pounder and move on
25/10/2024, 12:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And have been doing this for 10 years 🤷
25/10/2024, 12:37 am - Taha Ahmed: @60193244266 that's a convenient way to track burgers - great tip! 👍🏽
25/10/2024, 12:38 am - Taha Ahmed: Esp if you don't want to get into the nitty gritty of it
25/10/2024, 12:38 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Double patty is double quarter pounder
25/10/2024, 12:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pizza is dominos or Pizza Hut. 

Fried chicken is KFC. 

And so on.
25/10/2024, 12:39 am - PF - Mariya Rehan: Got it

I am depressed 😔
25/10/2024, 10:17 am - PF - Safwan Jamil: Same happened with me today

Raised around 0.5 kg of my last logged weight 😩
25/10/2024, 10:32 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s just water weight. 

Scale weight will fluctuate based on sleep, stress, food, bathroom routine, weather, climate and so much more. 

Stop focusing on daily fluctuations and look at the longer picture.
25/10/2024, 10:33 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
If I got depressed here and didn’t focus on what I was doing (habits) then I would see that new low after just a couple of days
25/10/2024, 11:06 am - Taha Ahmed: I know how it feels like but like Sameet already said, these fluctuations will happen no matter what you do and is mainly just water weight fluctuation. They are not in your control and are based on several factors.

That's why we want to focus on averages and not daily entries. 

You could experience 2kgs increase this week but overall weekly average would show that you have lost 0.75lbs (that's a lot).
25/10/2024, 11:07 am - Taha Ahmed: So focus on the bigger like it's shown in this screenshot!

Don't just look at the bump!
25/10/2024, 11:11 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): So yeh weight chk kernay ki azeeat roz li jaye ya weekly <This message was edited>
25/10/2024, 11:13 am - Taha Ahmed: It's better if you could do it daily, and take weekly averages (the sheet we've given will do it all for you)
25/10/2024, 11:14 am - Taha Ahmed: That way, you will see how your daily fluctuations change and don't matter as much as compared to your weekly change
25/10/2024, 11:16 am - Taha Ahmed: @923332078732 Are you using the tracking sheet we provided? <This message was edited>
25/10/2024, 11:16 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Yes
25/10/2024, 11:17 am - Taha Ahmed: Alright, and have you watched the accompanying video that I shared with it as well?
25/10/2024, 11:17 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Yes
25/10/2024, 11:18 am - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I have downloaded  the file removed previous  entries and started adding mine ....as much as I know to use it🙁 on phone
25/10/2024, 11:23 am - PF - Ali Haider: You guys are worried about 0.5 kg. My scale got up from 100 -> 103. What should I do? 😅

P.S. it is because of increased carb intake [water weight] and bad sleep cycle
25/10/2024, 11:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Best hai.
25/10/2024, 11:24 am - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
1. Daily entries (fluctuations can be seen here).
2. Weekly averages (you can see the weight is going down).

Starting weight was 70kg, and in week 2, the weekly average was 67kg – showing a loss of 3kgs in just 2 weeks!

Remember, weight naturally fluctuates daily due to things like water retention, sodium intake, digestion, and even stress. These changes are completely normal and don’t reflect actual fat gain.

So, focus on the bigger picture and stay consistent with your routine, calorie deficit, and exercise. This process takes patience and trusting the journey. Stay resilient and know that each week, you’re making real progress – the scale is just one tool to track it.

It’s all about building a healthy lifestyle that lasts, like Sameet has mentioned above.
25/10/2024, 11:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah sleep always makes my weight jump. I’ve started not checking my weight if I know I haven’t slept well. 

It’ll also jump if you are food outside the previous day, because of added sodium (salt)
25/10/2024, 11:26 am - Taha Ahmed: Another great strategy for y'all!^ 

I struggled with this for most part of my life and I wish someone had told me this earlier haha.
25/10/2024, 11:34 am - PF - Safwan Jamil: Yeah i had a very had sleep yesterday 

Still my muscles are soaring 

Also last week i started taking creatine regularly which could be the reason of an extra water retention
25/10/2024, 11:35 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, there you go! Creatine also retains water, so that could be the reason you weight went up. It's normal.
25/10/2024, 11:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100% creatine will make weight jump 1-2kgs
25/10/2024, 1:17 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: OMG same here....i was so depressed as i gain weight on daily basis😭
25/10/2024, 2:27 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Can someone please remind me how many calories are in a slice of margherita pizza
25/10/2024, 2:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 250ish
25/10/2024, 2:39 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So I had 2 slices now for breakfast... so that's gonna be 500 ish calories
25/10/2024, 2:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
25/10/2024, 3:24 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So I just asked a question on Facebook as it's not an urgent one, but I don't know if it went through....
So with calorie deficit, we lose weight.. how do I lose body fat?
25/10/2024, 3:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Calorie deficit + protein intake + training
25/10/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Amna Mir: <Media omitted>
How many calories would be in a large cup of Iceland mosambi juice. 

This is breakfast
25/10/2024, 3:45 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I started with 82.6kgs and for first two weeks whenever I checked I was 83kg + but this week I started weighing my self every day like recommended in the video. From 83kg + to it directly went at 82.2kg which I haven’t seen before. Specially for women, which part of your cycle you’re at impacts a lot on what you will see on scale. I even had to wear pants with a belt this week which were tight on me just 2 months ago :) not only my weight changed a lot, I felt more leaner and clothes got baggier too 

I am sharing this to help motivate anyone who is feeling down. As someone on the same journey I understand sometimes how demotivating scale can be but try your best to not let it get to your head. Just keep going, your efforts won’t go to waste. Again like Sameet said if you stopped at this point you won’t see your lowest. If I stopped, thinking even after two weeks my weight is more than what I started with. I wouldn’t have seen my lowest

It’s challenging I know but it’s worth it
25/10/2024, 3:47 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: And also the very next day it went back to 82.4🫣making scale matter everyday is not gonna be good for your mental health at all
25/10/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: While I am at it, let me share this too. Everyone around me knows I’m on weight loss journey so they keep asking how many kgs I have lost which also made it me upset sometimes but then I realised it’s not their validation on how many kgs I lose I am working for. I need to stay focused on long term goal. Crash diet tu ni hai na ye Jo foran 10kg down. It’s a lifestyle I am striving for
25/10/2024, 3:52 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Apki body shape mein aati hay inches loose hotay hain mera 2 months say stuck ho gaya tha weight laykin body shape mein aarahe the abb weight inches dono  jaa rahay hain bass calorie deficit mein hona zaroori hay ager app proper defficet mein ho tou result 💯 ayein gay
25/10/2024, 3:56 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Yes also my waist was 35.9 last week tk I was so bloated but this week It measures 35.2 which was such a huge change all of a sudden. Because there were so many other factors contributing to bloating calorie deficit tu same 1600 hi hai last 2 weeks sy. It was just other factors contributing to bloating
25/10/2024, 4:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Love this. 

And yes, your menstrual cycle will have a big impact on this. 

Most women gain a kg or so in their luteal phase (1-2 weeks before the period) but some can also gain weight (water weight) on the week of your period.

25/10/2024, 4:18 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): ?
25/10/2024, 5:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Minimum 200ish
25/10/2024, 5:35 pm - PF - Amna Mir: What entry do I add for this?
25/10/2024, 5:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did it have any sugar?
25/10/2024, 5:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Or was it pure mosambi juice?
25/10/2024, 5:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d do like 500g of oranges or something like that. 

Can also search fresh orange juice and add 500ml or whatever quantity it was
25/10/2024, 5:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cause large can be more than 500ml
25/10/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: It might be a silly question but... there is enough fat in my body so why do I need to take it in my meals?
25/10/2024, 6:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not silly at all! While our bodies have fat stores, it's different than dietary fat, which is essential for hormone production, nutrient absorption, and overall cell health.

My dinner 484 calories with 36 g protein 😋
25/10/2024, 7:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks brilliant.
25/10/2024, 9:05 pm - PF - Mariya Rehan: Is eating animal fat healthy? Like how they make kababs wrapped in fat. Is it recommended to eat?
25/10/2024, 9:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it can be part of a balanced diet (BUT IN MODERATION), as it provides energy and fat-soluble vitamins. 

It’s best to keep saturated fat intake within safe limits tho—like about 10% of your daily calories, or roughly 20-22 grams for a 2,000-calorie diet. Usually kebabs wrapped in fat we get are quite high in saturated fat, so you'll have to be very mindful.
25/10/2024, 9:14 pm - PF - Mariya Rehan: Alright. Thanksss

26/10/2024, 4:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Best guess would be 1200-1500
26/10/2024, 4:42 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): So i am done for the day in one go 🤯
26/10/2024, 4:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha that’s what can happen if we’re not mindful of eating food outside. 

I personally prefer ordering one thing and then focusing on that. 

The more you try different things the more calories you’re likely going to eat. 

If you eat the same thing, we generally get bored and get full faster. This concept is known as taste fatigue. 

This is why people eat loads more in buffets or always have room for dessert because it’s a different taste. 

You don’t have to starve yourself though. Just try to keep rest of the day, as basic as you can and then go back to usual calories tomorrow.
26/10/2024, 5:00 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I am not hungry yet but if I get hungry  I'll  be having protein  only as it was very less in whole meal
2 homemade kababs 24g protein  and 160 cal ....will it be good ?
26/10/2024, 5:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. If it fills you up. It can be a good option

How much time is left in project FoMo? 
Do we need to renew our membership please?
26/10/2024, 10:09 pm - PF - Mariya Rehan: I have the same kind of question.
Haven't reached my goal weight so should I do it another month? Of following the same work out and calorie count would do
26/10/2024, 10:11 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Honestly, I felt so good that I wanna get a lifetime membership 😌 
@923343773307 thanks a million 😊
26/10/2024, 10:12 pm - PF - Mariya Rehan: Haha same. It's been such a breath of fresh air
26/10/2024, 10:17 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Main to subscribe  hi 17th oct ko kiya hai
26/10/2024, 10:30 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: I also don’t want to finish it☹️
26/10/2024, 10:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: @447438584129 Hey! There's actually no time limit in Project FoMo—you can stay as long as you want! The project itself isn’t ending; we’re just grouping members into different cohorts to keep things organized. You're part of Cohort I, and our next group will be joining as Cohort II.

Think of Project FoMo like a Netflix subscription—you have access as long as you’re subscribed. If you decide to pause, you can step away and rejoin anytime. For payments, if you paid through Stripe, you’ll be automatically charged each month on your joining date (e.g., if you joined on October 6th, the next charge will be on November 6th).
26/10/2024, 10:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923452203212 If you’re enjoying the group support, accountability, and personalized guidance, it’s definitely worth sticking around! Project FoMo is designed as an ongoing journey, and it’s common for goals like weight loss to take more than a month. You could certainly take what you've learned and try it solo, but having our support can really make a difference in staying consistent and on track. And this is precisely why some of our 1-on-1 clients have worked with us for years, even after achieving their goals. 

With us, you’ll have guidance right at your fingertips to make things easier and to adjust as needed. Let us know if you’d like to continue, as there’s a lot more to unlearn, relearn, and apply as you move forward. Plus, we have even more educational content coming up soon! Sameet and I have been traveling, so things have been a bit tricky, but we’re still doing our best to keep everything valuable and consistent for you all.
26/10/2024, 10:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: And speaking of consistency… it's time for our weekly check-in! 🥳
Head over to the link shared below and spill the tea... haha. I mean share your wins, slips, and everything in between! Let’s keep this momentum rolling together, please! 🔥

We appreciate everyone pitching in and keeping this community alive, so thank you! 🙌🏽🙏🏽 

https://www.facebook.com/share/p/vNSZL2TFhhvCG5Uz/
26/10/2024, 10:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923204696944  good thing is that it's not! haha 💪🏽
26/10/2024, 10:51 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: How can we pause the subscription? How will it work?
26/10/2024, 10:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923224958005 You can let us know, and we'll manually pause your subscription for you. 

Just a heads-up, though: "pausing" means you'll lose access to both our Facebook and WhatsApp community groups, which also means missing out on valuable resources, ongoing support, and the motivation that comes from being part of our community.

If you must pause due to whatever reasons, we understand. That said, staying engaged is really beneficial; it's where the magic happens! The group support can help you stay accountable and keep the momentum going, even if you're taking a break from the active program. 

If you have any specific concerns that we haven't yet addressed, feel free to share, and we can find a way to work through them together!
26/10/2024, 11:54 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: Hey i want to pause for like 2 year
27/10/2024, 12:07 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: So when this group started, I was very motivated and enthusiastic. I wanted to learn all the anatomy of eating healthy and losing weight with portion control. First week was 9/10 & then life happened! Lost someone dearest to me n then my dad got sick too! I tried to log into the app daily. 
Some days are good & other days r really stressful. Managed to workout 3 days a week. I have this weird feeling of hopelessness 😢 
I feel that I will fail myself again
27/10/2024, 12:13 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: I have a history of losing + Gaining weight all my life! I'm 36 yrs now married for 14 yrs, have 2 kids. I lost 20 kgs with a keto diet in 2022. N now gained back those 14kgs! This yo-yo has always been part of my life! It's stressful and exhausting
27/10/2024, 12:18 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @923343773307 @60193244266 salaam group changing ho rahi hai ya new group or members add ho ray Hain?
27/10/2024, 12:21 am - Taha Ahmed: @923130576941 we'll be adding new members in this same community group
27/10/2024, 12:21 am - Taha Ahmed: @923338613147 for 2 years?
27/10/2024, 12:22 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): New session kab start hoga?
27/10/2024, 12:31 am - PF - Sadia Naeem: Yes i am mommy to be so i took me almost 2 years to come back
27/10/2024, 12:33 am - Taha Ahmed: @923224958005 I’m truly sorry to hear about the challenges you've been going through. It takes a lot of courage to share that and even to show up. Losing someone close and caring for a sick parent are incredibly difficult experiences, and it’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and less motivated. Life throws unexpected hurdles at us, and those ups and downs are a natural part of the journey. It’s actually a huge win that you’re still finding the strength to stay connected, and work out when you can—that resilience and commitment speak volumes.

I can definitely relate to the feeling of having life suddenly change direction. Earlier this year, I was working out regularly, eating well, and finally seeing progress in building my nutrition startup. Then, I was diagnosed with cancer for the second time, and just like that, everything shifted. The plans I’d carefully set up were put on hold as I adjusted to my "new normal". After pausing completely for the first four months, I’ve slowly resumed, doing what I can, and taking things day by day.

The purpose of sharing this isn’t to minimize what you’re feeling—far from it. It’s to share that life’s journey often isn’t linear; it ebbs and flows, especially during challenging times. 

And when it comes to grief, it’s something we carry with us, gradually learning to live around it. We may never stop grieving, but over time, it becomes a part of us in ways that add depth and resilience, not weights that hold us back.

As for weight fluctuations, I understand how discouraging it can feel, especially after all your hard work. But this time, we’re building something sustainable, something that doesn’t rely on extremes (like keto, etc.) but rather on balance, allowing room for life’s ups and downs. The process might be slower, but every step forward—however small—brings you closer to lasting change.

If you ever feel like you’re losing hope, reach out to us within the group or privately. We’re all here to support you, both through the setbacks and the wins. And it’s okay to go at a pace that feels right for you, especially given all you’re balancing right now. It's already HARD for you. And please, remember to give yourself grace and tell yourself that this journey isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress, one step at a time, and finding a rhythm that fits your life. 

You’ve got this, and remember, you’re not alone!!
27/10/2024, 12:39 am - Taha Ahmed: If you're finding value in the group’s support, accountability, or guidance, then staying on might be just the boost you need to keep making progress on this path. You’ve got 45 amazing people here cheering you on and 2 coaches who deeply care about everyone in this group—it’s a powerful support system! <This message was edited>
27/10/2024, 12:41 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Taha has covered everything I was going to write so I’m going to just tell you that you can’t ever fail yourself unless you give up. 

Just because you tried and didn’t succeed the first few times isn’t failure. 

This isn’t a race and everytime you go through the journey you learn something (for example; how keto worked in the short term but didn’t work long term), and that helps you in the future. 

This is a marathon and the goal is to cross the finish line even if it takes longer than expected.
27/10/2024, 1:07 am - PF - Rahima Shahid: Thankyou coach @923343773307 @60193244266 
Every word that U just said is so comforting ❤️ 
I really appreciate all your efforts 🙏

27/10/2024, 11:15 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923224958005 Since @923343773307 has already covered everything I was going to say, I want you to know that you are not alone in this journey and I too have lost and gained weight multiple times. After learning the reality of nutrition based on scientific evidence and how our bodies actually work, I worked with a personal trainer who helped me and guided me much like @923343773307 and @60193244266 are doing for us right now. Alhumdullilah I lost 16 kgs over a period of 3 months AND gained muscle as well (had never done strength training before). In fact, he was the one who introduced me to @60193244266 and now I'm a proud member of Project FoMo 🫡

When I had to take a break for a few months because of life and health issues, I did end up gaining back a few kgs but that only happened because I realized challenges will always appear in life but giving up is not the solution. Time to get back up and get back in the fight 😎💪🏼
27/10/2024, 11:16 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: My journey is far from over and I will be staying In Sha Allah. @923343773307 @60193244266

Is this accurate?
27/10/2024, 4:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you walk around a lot?
27/10/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Not that much. It was Just one day.. 😅
27/10/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Normally not more than 1 hour per day
27/10/2024, 4:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: I mean you must have moved around a lot, that's why it's 13k, unless you took a very bumpy ride and it considered those bumps as a step movement 😅
27/10/2024, 4:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: I won't focus on the calories burned, that's not accurate for sure
27/10/2024, 4:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I once drove to and from Hyderabad when the highway was a mess. Ended the day with 45000 steps.
27/10/2024, 4:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 😂😂😂
27/10/2024, 4:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahahah 😭😭
27/10/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Ali Haider: What would be the estimated calories burned with this much walk? Not even 300 calories?
27/10/2024, 4:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Can't say for sure. It varies and depends on each person's fitness level. Someone who's regularly active will burn fewer calories than someone who's doing it for the first time.

These apps/watches don't account for that factor.
27/10/2024, 5:08 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: If I dont remember to take off my band before bed, and I'm on the phone and moving around my arm a little while talking I have easily done anywhere from 250-500 steps lying down depending upon how long the band has been on

27/10/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Large
27/10/2024, 10:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Will be 250-350

How many calories in this chat? It's without the bara. Only dahi phulki with sauces, salad & papri
28/10/2024, 3:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just a quick heads-up that both Sameet and I are traveling/in-transit at the moment, so we might not be able to respond as quickly as usual. Please expect a bit of a delay today, but we’ll be checking in whenever we can. 🙏🏽
28/10/2024, 3:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: 250-300

28/10/2024, 6:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah I’d go with 300ish as well
28/10/2024, 8:48 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: Assalam o alaikum
sometimes I don't hit my target macros... but stay in my targeted calories
How badly it would affect my progress
28/10/2024, 8:49 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: Most importantly my protein intake
29/10/2024, 3:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll still lose weight if your in your calories. 

Protein intake is importantly for muscle retention and overall health though. 

So if protein is low consistently (occasionally, isn’t a an issue) you might lose muscle with fat <This message was edited>

Daily update upload karna hai bas apni accountability ke liye, toh woh karte rahain if you want to. Aur agar aapko lagai ke walk aur exercise dono manageable hain to mix kar sakti hain, lekin agar heavy lagay tou bas yeh exercise hi continue karain. Slow and steady is what allows for greater progress and wins the race! 😊

29/10/2024, 6:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sure, you can take both together (that's what I do too sometimes)
29/10/2024, 6:56 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: Is there a specific way to take this supplement or we can take it daily?
29/10/2024, 6:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: But I try not to rely too much on supplements like magnesium or melatonin. Instead, I’ve established a pre-bedtime routine that really helps. This means no screen time at least an hour before sleep, allowing my mind to unwind. I only lay in bed when I actually want to sleep, which helps create a strong mental association between my bed and rest.

Sometimes, I incorporate calming activities like reading a book, practicing deep breathing, or gentle stretching to signal to my body that it’s time to wind down. This consistent routine has made falling asleep much easier and has improved the quality of my rest overall. I lay in bed and pass out in a few minutes, like a baby.
29/10/2024, 6:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, not really. I take it after dinner and 2-3 hours before my bed time
29/10/2024, 7:03 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: MaashAllah.. you said the best thing. I will try to practice it
29/10/2024, 7:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: That’s exactly the right mindset! It can definitely take some time, so don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t feel natural right away or if you don't see any change.. For me, it took around 2-3 months to fully build this pre-bedtime ritual into my routine, but the benefits have been so worth it. Just stick with it and keep adjusting until it feels right for you. Consistency is key! 😊
29/10/2024, 7:15 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: insha'Allah

Sometimes I have to stay up till late night and then due to late night cravings I mess up the whole diet plan for that day and the next one. How should I manage this?

29/10/2024, 8:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Something like IF can’t help where you push your first meal back so you have calories left for later. 

I also sometimes rely on Coke Zero when up late to just help with cravings. 

Another approach is using low calorie snacks such as fruits
29/10/2024, 8:22 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Apk room KO aik completely change ki zaroorat hai jab tak k ap is project Mai in ho.
29/10/2024, 8:23 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Means push dinner and breakfast (next day). Seems doable. Will try it this time

Is this helpful for managing the symptoms of PCOS that I feel like ⬇️
✅ fatigue (feeling sleepy in class even after sleeping well at night.
✅ midday energy crashes 
✅ PMDD (pre menstrual depressive disorder)
✅ insomnia and accompanying anxiety 
✅ muscle aches after walking 9-11k steps daily 
✅ occasional muscle cramps 
✅ tensed and stiff shoulder muscles that ache a lot 
✅ migraines

29/10/2024, 9:00 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Do I need to add anymore supplements?
29/10/2024, 9:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: This supplement could potentially help, especially with energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity

The myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol may improve insulin resistance, which is often linked to fatigue in PCOS. Coenzyme Q10 and B vitamins support energy production, which could help with daytime energy levels. (tho not linked to PCOS directly and I'll also have to check the RDA for vitamin B and CoQ10)

While helpful, we'd suggest give it some time -atleast 3 months- to see if there’s any improvement!
29/10/2024, 9:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: For muscle aches, cramps, and stiffness, Magnesium is often recommended and may alleviate these symptoms
29/10/2024, 9:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: Is there anything else you're taking?
29/10/2024, 9:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: And while we provide RDAs and educate around supplements, please remember that individual needs can vary. We highly recommend consulting with a healthcare professional if the symptoms persist (especially for PCOS, PMDD, etc.), or before adding new supplements to ensure they align with your unique health profile and needs.

30/10/2024, 5:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it was an almond croissant like the one shown in the picture above, it'll probably have 400ish calories

How many calories will be in this sugar stick one weighs around 18-22 grams and i removed the upper sugar coating.
31/10/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 70-80
31/10/2024, 12:54 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): And how much calories will sugar coating add?
31/10/2024, 12:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d estimate 100ish for the full thing
31/10/2024, 4:54 pm - PF - Annam Saeed: Damn
31/10/2024, 5:12 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: A.O.A everyone,
I wanted to ask advice on a serious matter (serious for me at least).

Past one year I faced a lot of menstrual problems. A lot of blood loss happened during this time. Alhamdullilah everything is normal and my tests are also normal now but I have this extreme weakness now. My weight didn’t reduce during this phase but I feel lethargic all the time. I just go for grocery and get so tired and irritated that I want to lay down on bed immediately. I want to start building some strength but I don’t understand how to start. I kept asking questions in the group to get motivated but still I don’t know what to do. Even less than 1k steps a day make me super tired. 
Can you guide me on this how to start again to get my health back as I am extremely worried right now
31/10/2024, 5:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Walaikum Assalam @60199004077,

Thanks for sharing this—it sounds really challenging, and it’s completely understandable to feel this way after heavy blood loss. Start small: focus on iron-rich foods (like leafy greens, red meat, and citrus (vitamin C) for better absorption) to help with energy. Consider an iron supplement if a doctor recommends it, as it might speed up your recovery, esp. with blood lose and increased Hemoglobin.

For movement, aim for light stretches or seated exercises, gradually adding steps each week if you can. Hydration also makes a difference, so keep water handy throughout the day.

You’re already on the right track by seeking support—just take it one step at a time. It’s about the small, consistent efforts that allow your body to adapt without exhausting you. 😊

That's from me.
31/10/2024, 5:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Have you consult your GP/Gynae about this?
31/10/2024, 5:26 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: They just look at the tests and say everything is fine we don’t know why you experience lethargy
Medical system in Malaysia really messed up my mental health also
31/10/2024, 5:27 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: I don’t know which one is red meat
Also, I have to walk daily due to my job
Right now I book indrive for travelling 
But only 20 mins walk makes me super tired
31/10/2024, 5:35 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: @60199004077 I can understand your feelings as I am going through the same physical pains and when I asked the doctors they said everything is okay.. I don't feel like even getting up, talking to anyone or doing anything for myself..
I wish, hope and pray for you to get well soon.
31/10/2024, 5:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Couple of things to mention;

1. If possible get iron levels checked. 
2. ⁠lethargy can also be because of low vitamin D levels (Malaysia doesn’t get much sun)
3. ⁠also, think about not being in a deficit and trying to lose fat during this time. Instead, aim for maintenance and improving overall health and energy levels.
31/10/2024, 5:47 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: This is a very difficult thing as it doesn’t show up in tests and there is really no way to explain what the body is going through 
I hope we can get okay some day
31/10/2024, 5:48 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: I didn’t try to lose weight that’s why till date my weight is maintained 
But still I feel lethargic and irritated after a few steps only
31/10/2024, 6:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did any doctor get iron levels checked? 

Cause when you lose blood, you lose iron and lack of iron can cause tiredness and lethargy.
31/10/2024, 6:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or even thyroid levels
31/10/2024, 6:07 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: No one got these checked
They just tell me “you seem fine there is nothing wrong that we noticed”
31/10/2024, 6:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is why I don’t trust doctors 🤦
31/10/2024, 6:14 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: They also say maybe you’re stressed out
Try controlling your stress levels
31/10/2024, 6:16 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I want to know how to control stress .......stress na liya Karen....matlab ham kia khareed  k letay hain stress
31/10/2024, 6:17 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Yesssss
It’s like thank you for telling me
Mjhe pta hi nhi tha k stress ko ese control krtey hain
31/10/2024, 6:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Managing stress doesn’t have to mean just “letting it go”—often, stress gets stored in the body. Here are some effective, body-centered techniques that I have learned in therapy myself (I work with a trauma-informed psycho-somatic therapist for myself) and here's what I learned and that has helped:

1. Box Breathing: Breathe in, hold, exhale, and hold each for 4 counts; it calms the nervous system.
2. Tapping (EFT): Tap gently on acupressure points to release tension and lower stress hormones. (you'll have to explore more as its a more advanced method, but honestly, it does wonders, atleast for me it has!)
3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Tense and relax muscles from head to toe. It helps releasing stored stress. (ofcourse, it doesn't happen in just one or two sessions, you have to make it a habit/a practice that you consistently follow)
4. Gentle Movement: Activities like tai chi or yoga help ease stress from the body. (TaiChi has helped me significantly after my surgeries when I wasn't able to exercise. It grounded me and helped with focus and letting go of stress- I can share a 5-min YouTube tutorial to get started)

Oh, and Daily Mindfulness Meditation too! Can share a free course on that if anyone wants that I have previously done myself as well.
31/10/2024, 6:22 pm - PF - Parishy Noor: Stress relief therapies hoti hain…. Stres Mainly cause hota ha 2 bato sy ya to ap situation ko control krny ki kosish krty hain or wo ho no raha hota Weasy…ya ap expectation zayada rkh laity hain kisi cheez ko ly k or result Weasy ni aty …..
31/10/2024, 6:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: We all have stressors in our life and some that we can't ever let go of or control. But it's important for us to learn how to react or navigate that terrain without feeling overwhelmed, to better regulate our nervous system, that makes our daily life easier.
31/10/2024, 6:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: The goal here should be to NOT FIX anything, but regulate
31/10/2024, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Love the recommendations for stress management. 

But this level of lethargy IS NOT being caused by stress. 

There’s an underlying issue that the doctors have failed to recognize. 

This is why i recommend getting iron levels / thyroid checked.
31/10/2024, 6:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, for sure. So many things at play here. Iron/thyroid/VitD, etc.
31/10/2024, 6:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And these therapies are great but there’s one thing that will probably have a much bigger impact than this. 

It’s also something that most people aren’t getting enough of. 

That thing is SLEEP. 

I don’t care how stressed I am, if I’m well slept i will 100% handle that stress better.
31/10/2024, 6:36 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): @60193244266@923343773307  can we talk about obesity in kids. My daughter is 9. She's 42 kilos. I never thought k wo obese hai. But now the kids have started bullying her in school. Also she is on spectrum so she gets really upset and even refuses to go to school. I've talked to school as well they are very supportive but kids can be means sometimes. Aj bhi she came back for school and had a proper meltdown I can't see my kid like this. Plz help me how can I manage her diet without restricting any food. Or do I need to enroll her separately for the coaching 
Plz let me know
31/10/2024, 6:37 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): My daughter  is 8 and she is also on spectrum
31/10/2024, 6:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Kids that young don’t really need coaching or ANY restriction. 

I’d focus on improving eating habits instead. 

And a great way to do that is changing the food you guys eat as a family. More focus on protein, vegetables and things like that.
31/10/2024, 6:40 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Usually  kids on spectrum  tends to have more sweet mine love choclate and cookies plus u can also try adding some physical  activities
31/10/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): Exactly. And they do not follow any instructions
31/10/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I take mine for swimming  on weekends and am planning  to take her for walks as she on antisezzure med and have gained 3 kg in 20 days
31/10/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): So I have to keep eye on that too
31/10/2024, 6:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes, focusing on physical activities is another brilliant idea
31/10/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): I know but she's very very stubborn in this. Doesn't go out much. I think she notices that people are staring at her n gets embarrassed. 
Can I track her meals??
31/10/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): I'm in the same boat. May I ask if she's on early spectrum?
31/10/2024, 6:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can on your own but don’t involve her in the tracking. She’s too young for that
31/10/2024, 6:45 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): Yes off course I would never do that
31/10/2024, 6:45 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I second sameet u can alternate her cravings but don't restrict  its her growing age
31/10/2024, 6:48 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): I don't want to. That's why I posted here. Can you plz share how you manage
31/10/2024, 6:55 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Yes, can you please share the video @923343773307
31/10/2024, 6:58 pm - PF - Summiya Syed: Yes please do share.
31/10/2024, 7:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Absolutely, Sameet’s advice is spot-on. Given her age, it’s key to keep things positive and empowering, with a focus on building healthier habits rather than focusing on weight itself and restriction of any sort.

Focusing on family meals is key here—prepare balanced meals together, focus on protein and veggies and fruits while keeping the atmosphere relaxed. Show her that these type of foods are good for overall health.

As a role model and a parent, your own healthy habits will inspire her, as kids often emulate their parents. 

If she doesn't like getting out of the house because others stare at her and she feels embarrassed, try finding fun home-based activities, like dance or family workouts, can make movement enjoyable rather than a chore. Do it with her to she feels at ease and again, don't make it feel like a 'Chore' she must do.

Also, creating a positive food environment with healthy snacks that she can choose from will empower her without any restrictions. You won't need to track food per se, but this way you'll know she's eating more nutritious foods. 

Lastly, it’s important to nurture her self-esteem by encouraging her interests outside of food and body image. Great recommendations for that above, like taking her for swimming, or other sports perhaps. 

And this is tricky, but be mindful of avoiding conversations about weight loss in front of her. Remember, she’ll pick up on your attitudes and beliefs, so focusing on positivity and enjoyment will guide her towards a healthier mindset, and an overall better health.

31/10/2024, 7:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Tai Chi 5 minutes - for beginners: (you may feel stupid doing it the first time, but trust me, it gets better every time and your flows/movement becomes fluid - to me, it's more mental than physical. I try to not rush and just do whatever I am able to. Somedays are great, some days are meh, but again, consistency is what I strive for!)

01/11/2024, 2:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Most phones today have built-in motion detectors or step counters, so if you carry your phone while walking, it can automatically track your steps.

That's what I do and I don't own a smartwatch/fit band, etc.
01/11/2024, 2:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: You'll need to set up the Health app on your phone to track steps accurately. For Samsung users, use the Samsung Health app, and for iOS, there's the Health app. Make sure they're properly configured to start tracking.

01/11/2024, 10:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Single patty 600ish.
01/11/2024, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cause burger lab uses ALOT OF sauce.
01/11/2024, 10:33 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Phir? Na keroun order 😂
01/11/2024, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just use quarter pounder ki calories for single patty beef burgers
01/11/2024, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Burger lab tastes horrible 😂

But you can definitely fit it in your calories

What would be the calories in this candy. It weighs 5g was unable to scan barcode
02/11/2024, 3:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's possibly all carbs so 5g x 4 kcal = 20 kcal

1g carb = 4 kcal
02/11/2024, 6:43 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): What will be Arox calories  in quetta hotel ka paratha
02/11/2024, 7:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I used to estimate 400
02/11/2024, 8:02 pm - PF - Ali Haider: That's oil plus a lot of maida.. still 400? Not bad!
02/11/2024, 8:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A regular dawn paratha is 280-320 calories if I remember correctly. 

So this has more oil so 400-450.
02/11/2024, 8:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus, another way to look at it is that a naan is 250ish calories. So you add oil and top of that. 450 sounds decent. 

If the paratha was deep fried then it could be higher
02/11/2024, 8:33 pm - PF - Mariya Rehan: Calories in 250g haleem
02/11/2024, 8:33 pm - PF - Mariya Rehan: ?
02/11/2024, 8:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Divide it like:

160g cooked lentils
90g chicken or beef
3tsp oil
02/11/2024, 8:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or actually 100g lentil
60g aata
90g cooked chicken or beef
3tsp oil

How many calories are in an oreo milkshake
02/11/2024, 8:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: 150-200ml milk
1-2 scoops of vanilla icecream
3-4 pieces of oreos

If using 1 scoop of ice cream and 3 Oreos: ~420 calories
If using 2 scoops of ice cream and 4 Oreos: ~680 calories

And then added sugar (if there's any)
02/11/2024, 9:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Alternatively just add a McDonald’s chocolate milkshake entry. 

I think it’s about 550 calories.
02/11/2024, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So almost the average of what Taha shared.
02/11/2024, 10:06 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: I'm not regretting because I shared that with my family😅

02/11/2024, 11:20 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I have a query. 
when tracking our meals daily, should we  track all the ingredients separately or just a dish on the whole? 
E.g. should I  add 150gms chicken boneless handi OR I need to track down all the ingredients separately added to make the specific dish?
02/11/2024, 11:21 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Usually when I make the food for the entire family, I take my portion out and  weigh it. Or should I make my meals entirely separate? (That's a hassle)
02/11/2024, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ingredients is always going to be more accurate. 

But if you’re cooking in batch then you can just estimate ingredients (since you’ll know what went into it)

Share a picture of your food and I’ll guide you how to track it then
02/11/2024, 11:26 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Ok great 👍 will do it tomorrow

03/11/2024, 12:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: At the moment we only have stripe. 

Payments are a pain to handle online when working with Pakistan because we don’t have much services. 

Even this stripe is only available to us because I don’t live in Pakistan 🤦

03/11/2024, 2:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you weigh out your portions then tracking will be a lot more easy and accurate.
03/11/2024, 2:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, things like how much milk and sugar you add to tea can change calories completely

03/11/2024, 2:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Everything looks great but add 2tsp oil for the keema. 

And you used 1.5tsp ghee for the paratha?

03/11/2024, 2:44 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Was it too much🙁 I wanted to have desi nashta today
03/11/2024, 2:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Actually a pretty good meal.
03/11/2024, 2:47 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
I used to log desi ghee 1 tbsp 10 grams until I saw my mother using this much. It's Definitely not 10g. What would be a better estimate. 25g or 30?
03/11/2024, 2:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Difficult to tell. Maybe just weigh it once so you get an estimate.
03/11/2024, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1tbsp is usually 15g but a heaped one can easily be 30g too
03/11/2024, 2:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: 😦
03/11/2024, 2:58 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Mine was metled
03/11/2024, 3:00 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Measured it. 

It is almost 25 grams
03/11/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Weight should be the same for both right? Either melted or not?
03/11/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Nope melted is less as itgets more space
03/11/2024, 3:04 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Volume is different for both of them. But at the end the weight should be the same
03/11/2024, 3:56 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
Also these are the nutritional information for raw flour that I use.
Would it be the same for roti or less?
03/11/2024, 4:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A roti is generally 120-150 kcals
03/11/2024, 4:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But this works also
03/11/2024, 5:25 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Now I'm gonna eat a paratha and I did this calculation:
150g kcals of roti
And 1 tsp of butter 
In total 250 calories 
🙏🏻
03/11/2024, 5:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. 5g of butter is 1tsp

This is homemade mutton kunnah. I used 1/3 cup oil in 2kg mutton, 1 medium sized onion, ginger garlic paste 2 Tbsp and basic Spices. I want to know the calories in this plate
03/11/2024, 10:32 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: There are two pieces of mutton in here 👆🏻
03/11/2024, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many servings roughly from the total dish
03/11/2024, 10:36 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: 7-8 appx
03/11/2024, 10:36 pm - PF - Seher khan: I am doing intermittent fasting, any advice on what type of food should I focus on for breaking that fast initially? Proteins??
03/11/2024, 10:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, ideally, but it's better to have a balanced meal that includes protein, healthy fats, and some fiber-rich carbs to keep energy steady
03/11/2024, 10:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then just divide the portions you mentioned by 7.
03/11/2024, 10:39 pm - PF - Seher khan: Perfect. Thanks.
03/11/2024, 10:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So 2kg meat divided by 7 is 285g of meat. 

Do the same for oil and ginger garlic paste. You can skip the onion and spices
03/11/2024, 10:41 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: That's 10g oil per 285g of meat. Right?
03/11/2024, 10:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: ⅓ oil is around 2.67 oz
1 oz is 28ish g

28 x 2.67 = 74.76g / 7 = 10.68g
03/11/2024, 10:42 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: So total calories in this plate is 300? Haina?
03/11/2024, 10:44 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: This is great! Thank you @60193244266 
Now I'll be able to calculate most of my calories on my own 👌🏻
03/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Alot more than 300 kcals

95ish cals from oil
285gm meat will have at least 700 cals
03/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think 285g meat is with bones
03/11/2024, 10:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Minus that and you'll have a lot more accurate estimate <This message was edited>
03/11/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Yes it is
03/11/2024, 10:52 pm - PF - Annam Saeed: 🤤

03/11/2024, 10:54 pm - PF - Annam Saeed: 😂
03/11/2024, 10:55 pm - PF - Annam Saeed: They add a lot of atta/corn flour to thicken the gravy
03/11/2024, 10:55 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: It's so finger lickin good 🤦‍♀️
I've had so much kunnahs all my life 😂
03/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Sahi baat hai
03/11/2024, 11:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And a lot more oil possibly
03/11/2024, 11:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d do 220g meat but yeah definitely more than 300 calories
03/11/2024, 11:03 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Actually I misunderstood. I was just calculating the weight together, n forgot to turn them into calories. That's how I thought 300 cal 😂
03/11/2024, 11:04 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I'm learning gradually!
03/11/2024, 11:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahaha we’ve all made these errors
03/11/2024, 11:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Initially, When I first started tracking in 2012, I used to think 300g chicken is 300g protein.... so yeah! Haha!

Like Sameet said, we've all made our fair share of mistakes. That's how we all learn!
03/11/2024, 11:40 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Taha sir after doing so much internships, taking lectures still I had that concept 300 g chicken is 300g protein 😏😏😏
In this group Sameet sir ny concept clear Kia and one of group member here then I came to know oh acha it’s not like that 100g chicken only 21-23g protein
03/11/2024, 11:42 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Not only this so many other confusion are also resolved by sameet sir and you
03/11/2024, 11:43 pm - PF - Maham Aslam: Thank you so much @60193244266 @923343773307 Although thank you is not enough
04/11/2024, 12:06 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923014593333 may I know how many hours is your fasting window? I too use IF to stay in a deficit
04/11/2024, 12:07 am - PF - Seher khan: 18hours.
04/11/2024, 1:21 am - PF - Maham Rafi: @60193244266 @923343773307... can you please let me know why we don't need to track vegetables
04/11/2024, 1:27 am - PF - Maham Rafi: So, for example, if I eat 4 carrots and an eggplant and 100 grams of brown beans, would that not be 400 to 500 kcal ?
04/11/2024, 2:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can track them if you’re using 4-5 carrots then it’ll be 150ish calories.
04/11/2024, 2:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Mostly people have half a carrot and that’s like 20 calories so you can skip that
04/11/2024, 2:10 am - Taha Ahmed: Generally, we don’t need to track non-starchy veggies like carrots, eggplant, or leafy greens because they’re low in calories, packed with fiber, and super filling, so you naturally won’t eat huge portions anyway.

But, like Sameet said, if you’re using 4-5 carrots, that can add up to around 150 calories or so — that’s where tracking might be useful. Beans and starchy veggies like potatoes, corn, or peas, on the other hand, are a bit denser in calories, so it makes sense to track those if you’re counting everything closely.

If you’re juicing veggies, though, then yeah, tracking would help because the calories can add up quickly when you’re drinking them instead of eating them whole.

04/11/2024, 11:16 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Magnesium
04/11/2024, 11:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s 500mg of oxide. Oxide is pretty useless.
04/11/2024, 11:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your body can’t convert that basically.
04/11/2024, 11:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So if these are the two options, I’d go with the other one
04/11/2024, 11:17 pm - PF - Amna Mir: My brother got me the multiple vitamin one. 
So in order to increase the dose can I have two of these ?
04/11/2024, 11:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just search garlic sauce. It’ll most be fat based so you can also just track it as mayonnaise
04/11/2024, 11:18 pm - PF - Amna Mir: It has magnesium gluconate 200 mg
04/11/2024, 11:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh dosages 2 capsules ki hi hain. You can have 4.
04/11/2024, 11:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh no. You’re right. This is for one capsule.
04/11/2024, 11:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So have two then.

05/11/2024, 11:48 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 is shilajit a really good supplement to increase testosterone and energy levels?
05/11/2024, 11:55 am - Taha Ahmed: Hi Jaish! good question—so, shilajit is often marketed as a natural enhancer for testosterone and energy, but let’s see what the research actually says.
05/11/2024, 11:59 am - Taha Ahmed: When we talk about “energy,” we’re technically talking about calorie intake. Energy is the fuel your body gets from calories in food, so if you’re consuming adequate calories, your energy levels will naturally be sustained. Shilajit itself contains no calories, so it won’t provide energy in the same way that food does.

There’s little to no strong scientific evidence to support the claim that shilajit significantly boosts testosterone levels in 'healthy' individuals. While some studies have shown very slight increases in testosterone in specific cases (e.g., men with low testosterone), that's the same with Vitamin D as well. If you've very low testosterone levels, then shilajit or taking Vitamin D can increase the levels a lot.  The effects aren’t consistent or well-established across broader populations. For a meaningful boost, focusing on sleep, strength training, and nutrition is generally more impactful, unless your body can't produce more testosterone, then TRT is the way to go. (I'm on TRT now)

Shilajit may have some potential for general vitality, largely due to its antioxidant content. It’s rich in minerals and compounds that might help reduce fatigue and oxidative stress, which could, in turn, support overall health and recovery. However, these effects are mostly anecdotal (could be placebo); rigorous studies are limited, so we can’t fully validate these claims, yet.
05/11/2024, 12:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: I know Shilajit is being marketed as a miracle supplement, claiming to improve hormonal regulation and overall health. But in reality, for healthy individuals, it’s unlikely to have any significant impact beyond providing some minerals. unless it is loaded with something else, which is very possible. Pakistan mai kuch bhi kiya jasakta hai.

But remember that it won’t work any magic on its own, for men or women alike.

I've been doing "my version of caloric deficit" for two months i.e Aug & Sept not shed a single pound!!  but it's been three weeks in project FOMO and I've lost 2kgs 🙃 I could feel that I was loosing inches but I've been so demotivated after those two months that I never checked my weight or inches! 
I feel I did nothing special, followed the caloric deficit, worked out thrice a week and lost 2kgs 💃
05/11/2024, 1:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s AWSOME

Calorie estimation of samosa chaat
05/11/2024, 1:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d estimate 500ish probably
05/11/2024, 1:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: That's wonderful news 🎊🙌🏼 keep going you've got this 💪🏼
05/11/2024, 2:21 pm - PF - Ali Haider: That's because samosa is deep fried? Or other ingredients?
05/11/2024, 2:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, deep fried Aalu Samosa + raita + chutni (meethi chutni has a lot of sugar)
05/11/2024, 2:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: And then chickpeas (if it had any)
05/11/2024, 2:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Samosa is deep fried so can easily be 250-300
05/11/2024, 2:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Really miss samosa chaat and even regular chaat though. 

Haven’t found those here in Malaysia
05/11/2024, 2:26 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Thanks. It's small things like this that matter a lot.

I remember I used to drink sugarcane juice just to complete my water intake goal, without knowing that a glass (~350 ml) will have more than 400-500 calories.. 😅

05/11/2024, 2:56 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Just had 265g of Murgh Cholay. Tracking it with the following ingredients:

- 3 TSP oil
- ⁠50g cooked chickpeas
- ⁠200g Raw Chicken thigh

This turns out to be 561 calories. Just have two questions:

- Do I need to track other ingredients that make up the gravy?
- ⁠The chicken was not boneless, do I need to change the ingredient or maybe adjust the weight?
05/11/2024, 2:57 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I was out since morning  just had my coffee  plus was sleep deprived ( my lil on will have tooth removal under GA she is on spectrum) ..so kuch banany ki himmat nahi thi  that was my breakfast and lunch
05/11/2024, 2:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I hate chow kit. Too dirty and crowded hahaha
05/11/2024, 2:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just adjust the weight slightly. Did you measure the chicken to see how much was it with the bones?
05/11/2024, 2:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay. Makes sense r
05/11/2024, 2:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: If those other ingredients are calorie-dense, then yes. I've heard some people use maida or atta to thicken the gravy, so if that was added, you'll need to track that too!

For the chicken, you can either remove the bones later and just track the meat or use an average. For example, if the chicken has about 50g of bones, you can track 150g of boneless chicken thigh.
05/11/2024, 3:00 pm - PF - Bisma Asghar: Haha samosa chat was good tho
05/11/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Nope unfortunately

06/11/2024, 12:49 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Idk what i’m doing wrong
06/11/2024, 12:51 pm - PF - Ali Haider: As long as your form is correct and you are progressing with weights, it's perfectly fine.

Most of the time we don't feel it but the muscle growth depends on the mechanical tension it gets from the weight lifting.
Right @60193244266 ?
06/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you send me your form video again?

It’s a compound movement so maybe that’s one reason why you can’t feel
It specifically. 

If form is on point then you’re definitely loading your back and that is the end goal however, you can switch it out for chest supported rows or a chest supported row machine and you might feel those better.
06/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely

06/11/2024, 2:38 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Yesss!!that’s why I’m making it a regular instead of thinking everyday ke kya banaun 🥹

06/11/2024, 3:27 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): Then how we calculate this
06/11/2024, 3:27 pm - PF - Aaish Khan (Saba Fahad): If this normal vanilla
06/11/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): What could be the calories in a chapati of 100g perra
06/11/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): Whole wheat
06/11/2024, 3:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Will have to see normal ice cream ki calories. Just search vanilla ice cream by Baskin and use 1 scoop. 

1 scoop is 65g too
06/11/2024, 3:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: About 200-250
06/11/2024, 3:30 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: Use fitscoop ice-cream if you want low calorie ice cream
06/11/2024, 3:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s protein ice cream. Low calorie too

06/11/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Oh wow I didn’t know about this😭I haven’t had ice cream for so long. Gonna order it now
06/11/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
this was 2 eggs. 1 cucumber. 1.5 carrot. 1 slice of bread. half a tbsp of ghee. should i add it in MFP as is?
06/11/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: question - does drinking alot of water during eating bad?
06/11/2024, 4:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How are you not having ice cream? You can easily fit in ice cream into your diet. I have it 3-4 times a week.
06/11/2024, 4:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. It’s fine.
06/11/2024, 4:35 pm - PF - Moeeza Arshad: Nutty salted caramel was too sweet for me 😂

2 eggs
1.5tsp of ghee
1 slice of bread
06/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: thankyou
06/11/2024, 4:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How was the overall meal? I’d suggest adding more protein to it. Maybe an extra egg or some cheese
06/11/2024, 4:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Or maybe some chicken nuggets 😋
06/11/2024, 4:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha or sausages
06/11/2024, 4:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: I wish I had a coach 10 years ago who'd tell me to have chicken nuggets and sausages with egg and cheese for breakfast 😅😭
06/11/2024, 4:38 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I was scared of calories in it🥲I drink coffee like 5 times a day and I love fruits too so my snacks can easily take up calories
06/11/2024, 4:39 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Sameeee😆
06/11/2024, 4:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Get some coffee flavored ice cream then 😅
06/11/2024, 4:40 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I need to do that, I wish I could have Americano all the time but unfortunately my stomach would never accept it😭
06/11/2024, 4:41 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I want to ask regarding exercise. My ribs hurts like hell some days due to my condition, so which exercises/ machines can I use those days at gym?
06/11/2024, 4:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: I blend a triple shot Americano with 30ml of milk, sweetener, and ice. It’s a game-changer! Definitely recommend trying it out if you’re into coffee drinks. I don't even want to have ice cream after this 😬
06/11/2024, 4:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t mind him. He’s trying to test at what level of caffeine does his heart explode.
06/11/2024, 4:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus he’s numbing his emotions through caffeine 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣
06/11/2024, 4:43 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I’m sorry ! Triple shot? But would love to know Which milk do you prefer with this 🫢I might try
06/11/2024, 4:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahahaha

06/11/2024, 4:44 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Oh I can tell🤭 but dw I am not judging I have same reasons of having coffee 5 times a day
06/11/2024, 4:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: I drink other stuff to deal with emotions 😀
06/11/2024, 4:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Jahaha
06/11/2024, 4:45 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Love cortado ✨
06/11/2024, 4:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, a triple shot is fun. And any fresh milk to go with it! 

Not a fan of almond/oat/soy milk, etc.

06/11/2024, 4:52 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Where did you study for masters
06/11/2024, 4:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’d recommend focusing on low-impact exercises like the stationary bike or elliptical for cardio, as these won't put too much strain on your ribs. For strength training, you can target your lower body with exercises like leg extensions and leg curls. For core work, try pelvic tilts and gentle bridges to avoid straining your ribs. Pls steer clear of heavy lifting or any twisting movements that might aggravate the pain.
06/11/2024, 4:56 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Haye! Same 😂
06/11/2024, 4:57 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Ribs pain are just the result of advanced stages of pregnancy. I can't help it.

Haha, I really appreciate both of you! But trust me, I'm very aware of my habits, and I work with a trauma-informed, psychosomatic therapist for my emotional and mental health. And no, I don’t drink to numb my emotions—Sameet just likes to pull my leg because I’m a huge coffee fan and he hates how well my body's able to tolerate it! 😅
06/11/2024, 4:59 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Hahaha as a coffee ☕️ affiando I wish I could stomach it well too 🥹

But glad to know your well being.
06/11/2024, 4:59 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Hehe not our alumni then🤭
06/11/2024, 5:00 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Which is yours ?
06/11/2024, 5:01 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Add me to the list of being envious of you in this matter and so glad you have been working with a professional✨that’s definitely rare in desi people
06/11/2024, 5:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahh makes sense then
06/11/2024, 5:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or how well he believes his body can tolerate it. 

Fun fact: you can build caffeine tolerance over time. 

There was a time I’d have a double espresso and be asleep and hour later. 

Then I stopped having all caffeine for a while (didn’t like relying on it all the time). 

And now a Coke Zero and I’m up for the next 8 hours. Lol
06/11/2024, 5:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Now you're getting older, that's why!
06/11/2024, 5:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: I could also have 10-12 cups of coffee, 2-3 redbulls and go to bed and fall asleep right away. Now I can't!
06/11/2024, 5:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: I guess I am getting older too 😋
06/11/2024, 5:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thanks for the update! Since the rib pain is due to pregnancy, it's important to focus on exercises that provide relief without straining the body. Have you tried pelvic floor exercises like Kegels for core stability? Some women also like gentle side stretches and cat-cow stretches for mobility and also seated leg lifts or knee extensions to target the lower body. 

@60193244266 any specific suggestions for her?
06/11/2024, 5:07 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): 10-12 cups of coffee bravo 👏
06/11/2024, 5:08 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I have started doing pelvic floor exercises, but for ribs I haven't found anything that can help ease pain
06/11/2024, 5:08 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: I’m glad you made a better choice for yourself
06/11/2024, 5:08 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: Okay… I have met a lotttt of caffeine addicts but not anyone who would claim this😳
06/11/2024, 5:09 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: This is next level
06/11/2024, 5:09 pm - PF - Abeeha Ali: And thank God ? Because this is insane
06/11/2024, 5:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’ve worked with various therapists over the years, but this time I went for someone who isn’t just focused on CBT. I wanted something more transformative, and this somatic approach feels like the radical shift I needed. It’s a totally different way of working through emotions, and I’m really liking it so far.

And not many Pakistani therapists are into this kind of work, so it feels even more refreshing! 

P.S My therapist is Canadian!
06/11/2024, 5:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Atleast I am honest about it haha!
06/11/2024, 5:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: That was me back in the university

06/11/2024, 5:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, the variations are due to differences in protein, fiber, and carbohydrate content, but are more or less in the same range
06/11/2024, 5:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: Pakistan mai har cheez ka yehi haal hai. Aap Nutrition aur Dietetics ki degrees dekhlain. They're still teaching the most outdated concepts to date. It's insane.

06/11/2024, 5:29 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Alright.
06/11/2024, 5:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you don’t mind updating it, go ahead and edit it. If not, don’t worry—small details like this won’t make a big difference overall!
06/11/2024, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just add 100g of apple and 100g of pomegranate to track it. If the chutney had sugar then add 1tsp sugar otherwise that’s it

Questions that you want quick replies too. 

Facebook is where the real coaching and detailed answers happen.
06/11/2024, 7:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What sort of coffee? 

Coffee itself has no calories so you need to track the milk and sugar you’re adding to it.
06/11/2024, 7:08 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Somatic and esoteric healing is SOO overlooked in our Pakistani and even commercialized university curriculum.  I had to teach myself this through certifications not offered in Pakistan. 


Mind body and soul all function together in healing. Ignoring any one aspect of the triad will not result in the growth we ideally aspire to.

06/11/2024, 8:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I generally eat out 3-4 times a week. 

Because at the end of the day, you’re always estimating when eating outside. And estimates can be off.
06/11/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Ali Haider: No doubt diet planning is the hardest thing in a fat loss journey .

06/11/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): Am sorry but am just having two meals a day in which u try having lower calorie breakfasts and then this kind of dinner. 

Trynna enjoy more Pakistani food while am here
06/11/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Why is that bro? Are you not enjoying different foods during the week? @923015190891
06/11/2024, 8:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. Comes down to your goals to an extent as well. 

I’m very stubborn with my goals and so I don’t mind sacrificing some of this for achieving my goals. 

I’m a lot more lenient when bulking and trying to gain muscle / weight.
06/11/2024, 8:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well usually one normal naan is 80-110g. So that’s 250 calories. So yeh bhi 150-200 hoga.
06/11/2024, 8:29 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I'm enjoying different foods but the problem is that sometimes I enjoy too much and then regret it later
06/11/2024, 8:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s understandable. I ate out everyday when I was in Pakistan lol. 

I knew I’m not coming back for 15-16 months after this so didn’t care about weight loss or weight gain. 

Now that I’m back home, game face is back.
06/11/2024, 8:29 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: How much gap should be there between a meal and workout?
06/11/2024, 8:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahaha
06/11/2024, 8:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends from person to person. I can workout while having a subway lol (upper body)

But usually 60-90 mins is good enough.

Had chicken handi with minmimal gravy. The weight was 160g. Tracking it as:

160g thigh chicken raw
2 TSP Oil
25 ml dairy cream 

Total Calories: 350

Make sense? Sorry for the non-aesthetic picture.
06/11/2024, 9:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, that looks good! 👍🏽
06/11/2024, 9:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah looks good.
06/11/2024, 9:47 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: <Media omitted>
Had two piece chicken breast with sauce in lunch. Let me know if tracking make sense.

200g chicken breast (weighed)
1 tbsp Margarine (estimate)
50ml Milk (estimate)
Maida 10g (estimate)

Total Calories: 400


Veggies were tomatoes, carrots and capcisum. Do I need to track them too?
06/11/2024, 9:54 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: <Media omitted>
My first meal of the day, infact first meal on Project FoMo
06/11/2024, 9:54 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: <Media omitted>
06/11/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks fine. There might be some sauce there too. No?
06/11/2024, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or cheese?
06/11/2024, 10:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Great job with the tracking. 

If you want suggestions, I’d recommend adding more protein to this meal. 

You want each meal to have 30-40g of protein.
06/11/2024, 10:14 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Hello hope you guys are doing well just joined today. I am looking for suggestions regarding a healthy and balanced breakfast something that is also quick and easy to make in the morning due to time constraints because quite frankly I am sick of eating boiled eggs 😅
06/11/2024, 10:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923161092719 You could do something like cheese omelet or scrambled eggs (2-3 eggs) with 1-2 pieces of bread and 2 sausages or 3-4 chicken nuggets on the side. It's a good balanced meal that'll keep you satiated for hours.
06/11/2024, 10:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: This may take a bit longer though lol
06/11/2024, 10:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's defo got either cheese or cheese sauce
06/11/2024, 10:20 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Can you tell me estimated calories for this?
06/11/2024, 10:20 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Apparently the sauce was made from maida, margarine and milk which is already accounted for. So no cheese.
06/11/2024, 10:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse! So,

Option 1: Lightly Fried with 2 tsp Oil
2 eggs (140 calories) + 1 slice of cheese (70 calories) + 2 tsp oil (80 calories) + 2 sausages (150 calories) + 1 slice of bread (70 calories)
Total: 510 calories

Option 2: Air-fried with No Oil
2 eggs (140 calories) + 1 slice of cheese (70 calories) + 2 sausages (150 calories) + 1 slice of bread (70 calories)
Total: 430 calories
06/11/2024, 10:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: These estimates are approximate and may vary!
06/11/2024, 10:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Interesting!
Yeah okay if it doesn't have any cheese then it looks good already y
06/11/2024, 10:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: What tracking app is easiest to use. The one I use doesn't count macros
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: I like MyFitnessPal
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: To me, it's the easiest
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's shows macros . Do I have to buy subscription
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope, it's free
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The free version is fine
06/11/2024, 10:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is MFP @447723402200
06/11/2024, 10:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I use MacrosFirst. You can try that one too
06/11/2024, 10:30 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Omlet in airfryer?
06/11/2024, 10:31 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Yes you can in a baking dish
06/11/2024, 10:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Everything tossed together in a baking dish. You can add some olives/mushrooms etc too and make Frittata 😅
06/11/2024, 10:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oh and it tastes better with sundried tomatoes and cheese
06/11/2024, 10:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: 🤤
06/11/2024, 10:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also make it a non stick frying pan without oil. 

Just cover it with a lid
06/11/2024, 10:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah that too!
06/11/2024, 10:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: I will add these tips in the next newsletter 🤞🏽
06/11/2024, 10:35 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): In breakfast Mostly i have 2 boiled egg whites with either a frozen paratha or 2 bran slices with a cup of tea.
06/11/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I make my eggs in 1 tables spoon oil everyday and my breakfast is same everyday . I thought it's ok to consume oil in moderation. Correct me if I'm wrong. I also put 3 4 grams of butter on my sourdough toast
06/11/2024, 10:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s barely 10g of protein so we can definitely improve here.
06/11/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I use extra virgin olive oil
06/11/2024, 10:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s okay to use oil in moderation but oil has calories. And calories are what matter for weight loss. 

The easiest way to cut calories is by reducing oil. 

Example: if you use 1 tbsp oil (120 calories) 

I make the same thing without oil, so even though we’re eating the same food, mine is 120 calories less. 

Which means I’ll lose more weight
06/11/2024, 10:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you sure it’s 3-4g? That’s like the size of your nail.
06/11/2024, 10:39 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Mine 2 eggs
6 tablespoon egg whites 
56 to 60 gram sourdough bread 
Tea with 1 teaspoon jaggery( powdered) 
6 to 8 blueberries 
Kefir 50ml
06/11/2024, 10:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s better. If possible check egg whites in grams so it’s easier to track.
06/11/2024, 10:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes sometimes I only have one toast . Sometimes I don't use it at all
06/11/2024, 10:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: 50 grams
06/11/2024, 10:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but usually when you butter one toast, it’s takes up 10-20g of butter. So just be mindful
06/11/2024, 10:41 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): How I increase protein by keeping calories under 350?
06/11/2024, 10:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s decent. Should be total 20g protein or higher
06/11/2024, 10:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: When I don't use egg whites I have cottage cheese with honey . But I'm assuming adding this stuff just add calories
06/11/2024, 10:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I try to increase protein but may be ending up adding more calories
06/11/2024, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any specific reason behind keeping calories under 350? 

You could have a 4 egg omlette without the paratha then. That’s 280 calories without oil and 320 if you use 1tsp of oil
06/11/2024, 10:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But this breakfast I have it after I break my intermittent fasting . 16 hours . And I workout while fasting in morning after dropping kids to school. So I'm starving
06/11/2024, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cottage cheese has protein too. So not a bad option. 

Once you track calories using a scale weight then you can better judge portion sizes and make substitutions if needed
06/11/2024, 10:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: All the more reason why it needs to be a meal with atleast 25-30g protein.
06/11/2024, 10:43 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Nothing specific i just try to save calories for the day by keeping breakfast low calorie.
06/11/2024, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay.
06/11/2024, 10:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I thought I need to have 25 to 30 g protein for recovery after workout.
06/11/2024, 10:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. That’s what I’m saying that if you’re having a meal after your fasted workout then make sure it has 25g of protein at least.
06/11/2024, 10:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And then I have tea again in evening and at 7 or 7.30 I have dinner 
With salmon or chicken or lamb with any carb and some vegetables and salad .
06/11/2024, 10:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I skip lunch
06/11/2024, 10:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Don't have time
06/11/2024, 11:16 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: How to put in calories for chicken pulao 🫣 or should I just avoid it.. 

My understanding is weight is chicken separately, and rice separately but I could be wrong
06/11/2024, 11:17 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Yes that's correct.
Add the estimated amount of oil also
06/11/2024, 11:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Spot on. Just add 2-3tsp of oil too. More if it’s really oily.
06/11/2024, 11:21 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: Thanks

07/11/2024, 1:31 am - Taha Ahmed: You could drizzle some olive oil for some healthy fats too
07/11/2024, 1:31 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I would rather use that olive oil to fry my anda for breakfast
07/11/2024, 1:33 am - Taha Ahmed: I'm sure you can spare a tsp of olive oil for both your breakfast eggs and this meal

I had this chicken bread how do it enter this in mfp?
07/11/2024, 1:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's kinda like chicken tikka pizza
07/11/2024, 1:25 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): There was ketchup or some chilli garlic sauce in stuffing ig
07/11/2024, 1:27 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): So should i enter chicken tikka pizza?
07/11/2024, 1:27 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
?
07/11/2024, 1:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: I mean, that's the safest and convenient option for me. That's what I'd do if there's no chicken bread option in the app.
07/11/2024, 1:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you have the whole thing?
07/11/2024, 1:28 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
This much
07/11/2024, 1:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Probably just one large slice then
07/11/2024, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is one of my favorite Tracking Hacks!

So if you can’t find an exact match for a specific food or are just unsure, use a similar food entry that has a comparable nutrition profile. For example, we tracked a slice of chicken tikka pizza in place of chicken bread, since they both have similar ingredients and macros (protein, carbs, and fat). 

Just remember to:
1. Choose a reliable entry in MyFitnessPal (ideally a verified one).
2. Adjust the portion if your food is smaller or larger.
3. Save this as a custom meal entry if you eat it often—this way, you can quickly add it next time with a single tap!
07/11/2024, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oh, let me share more hacks with you all! :p
It'll be helpful since many of you have just started tracking... <This message was edited>

07/11/2024, 1:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’ve tried these bars myself, so I can give you an honest opinion. Nutritionally, they’re solid, but the taste leaves a lot to be desired—especially the oat ones. I’m not usually picky about food, but even I struggled with these. The only ones I actually enjoyed were the ones with dark chocolate.
07/11/2024, 1:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Good idea. I'll try making a pdf document that I can share with you all!
Protein hacks or something 🤷🏽‍♂

Would you all want that?
07/11/2024, 1:42 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Yess it will be really helpful.
07/11/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I just checked  their site and which products I thought were low in protine  were high ones like peperoni etc
07/11/2024, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: When looking for a good protein bar, a helpful guideline is to check for a 1:10 protein-to-calories ratio. So, for example, if a bar has 200 calories, it should ideally contain at least 20 grams of protein.
07/11/2024, 1:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Will take picture of my breakfast today . Sent you dinner picture last night with trout
07/11/2024, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Here, another hack for you all!^ 😁
07/11/2024, 1:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: It would be much more helpful if you could post screenshots along with food pictures directly in our Facebook group. That way, we can give you more detailed feedback. 

This WhatsApp chat is best for quick questions and queries.
07/11/2024, 1:46 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Do we have any good protein  bars or yoghurt  in karachi we don't even have Greek yoghurt
07/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly, we don’t really have a ton of affordable protein options here. That’s why I mostly rely on meat for my protein goals, and I also make Greek yogurt at home, which helps a bit too!

Sure, you can get protein bars from places like JackedNutrition, but they’ll set you back 700-1000 bucks per bar, possibly more now. Unless you’re fine with spending that, it’s not the most practical option!
07/11/2024, 1:51 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Hanged yoghurt  is Greek one but how to track that
07/11/2024, 1:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: For homemade Greek yogurt, weigh it after straining. Track it as "Greek yogurt" based on the grams you have post-strain, which will be close in macros to store-bought Greek yogurt.

I get around 300-400g of Greek yogurt from 1kg normal yogurt, and I don't discard the liquid whey (that's technically protein as well) :p

I use that liquid whey when making things like white sauce for pasta, etc.
07/11/2024, 1:54 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will do that today
07/11/2024, 1:55 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
07/11/2024, 1:58 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): <Media omitted>
That's my lunch with approx 41 g protine  and I already logged  my expected dinner so I can adjust accordingly
07/11/2024, 1:58 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): <Media omitted>
07/11/2024, 2:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you fry them?
If so, the oil's missing in your entries :)
If not, then it's good!
07/11/2024, 2:01 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Nope airfryed
07/11/2024, 2:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Perfect 👌🏻
07/11/2024, 2:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ayesha, can you please share these on Facebook. Way easier to give feedback there.
07/11/2024, 2:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Btw protein options that I used to swear by in Pakistan. 

1. Sabroso Chapli Kebabs
2. ⁠Sabroso Shami Kebabs
3. ⁠Dawn Zinger Patties
07/11/2024, 2:06 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Will definitely  get these because I usually  take 2 meals so ya to breakfast proper desi chahiye ya full gourmet  I don't like eggs so ready to cook is good option  for me
07/11/2024, 4:01 pm - PF - Amna Mir: <Media omitted>
How do I measure this? Aaj meri fav dish khatam hogayi thi 🥲

Late breakfast+lunch , post workout meal.
07/11/2024, 4:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll be similar in calories. Mostly same ingredients.
07/11/2024, 4:06 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Any home made greek yogurt recipes?
07/11/2024, 4:07 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Guys, does anybody know how to deal with desi aunties and uncles that tell you in a gathering that you have to lose weight 🤔 I really want to say them, ke me apke ghar se nahi khati lekin pir bichme taneez ah jati he
07/11/2024, 4:08 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: And Masha Allah they themselves are even more than overweight... obese
07/11/2024, 4:09 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: I just put down my confidence
07/11/2024, 4:09 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: And creates social anxiety
07/11/2024, 4:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well, I used to add half a scoop of protein powder to it and turn it into flavoured pudding with some fruits and nuts or chocolate chips.
07/11/2024, 4:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s two approaches that work depending on the kid of person you are. 

1. Pretty much answering back with what you mentioned so that they shut up once and for all (I’ve done this but keep in mind I hate humans 🤣)
2. ⁠letting them know that you’re working on it and them making such comments isn’t welcome or helpful 
3. ⁠or just learn to ignore them
07/11/2024, 4:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Once an unknown aunty said something to a friend of mine at a wedding. 

I was like aunty iskay paas tou abhi bhi time hai but apki age and weight daikhtay way mujhay aap kay liye dur lag raha hai. 

Khair chorain, Gulab jamun la doon aapko?

She said no and I walked away 🤣
07/11/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Tbh, lemme give you some reverse psychology tip. 

The more attention you give to anything (literally anything) the more importance it gains. 
This is gonna be a bit hard but if you just ignore them and literally walk away from that place. With a straight face, trust me it’s gonna be much better for you. 

1. It shows them that their words have consequences and no one is going to listen to their judgement. 
2. ⁠ nobody can misconstrue your silence (words can be used against you) 
3. ⁠ you can use those words as fuel to get back at them once you’ve achieved your goal (anger is a valid emotion and I’m just letting you know how you alchemize it for your goal achievement) 

Personally I lost 35 kgs and whenever I worked out and wanted to slack off, I remembered what these people had to say and imaged how their faces would react once I reached my goal. 

Lool and I did see it happen in really what I had visualized. 
Feels better than COCAINEEE. <This message was edited>
07/11/2024, 4:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: If it were me, I’d just calmly let them know their behavior isn’t okay. If they still don’t get it and keep it up, that’s when I draw the line and cut them out.

Honestly, cutting people off when they show a lack of respect comes as naturally to me as drinking water. It’s just my way of setting boundaries. You cross that line intentionally, you’re out. Simple as that.
07/11/2024, 4:14 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: ❤️🌹🌹
07/11/2024, 4:14 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Hahahaahah
07/11/2024, 4:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: That being said, I get it’s not easy for everyone to do the same. I know that, as a guy, I have the privilege of being able to make these kinds of decisions without dealing with the same consequences others might face.^
07/11/2024, 4:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Love this 🔥🔥🔥
07/11/2024, 4:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely. It’s definitely easier for men to be this way than women (parents and what not come into play here)
07/11/2024, 4:20 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Thank you 😊
07/11/2024, 4:20 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Yeh sub Ka BOhot bara masla hai aur Saath yeh k nai Khao na nai Khao na yeh kya BAAT hai. apny ghr jaa k diet Kar layna.Khair hamari Tou Amma tak naraz ho jati Hain k mairay ghr ak yeh diet wali Baatain na Karo 🥺
07/11/2024, 4:22 pm - PF - Marium Khan: Just ask her app kay baap ka leh kaar naahi khaah rahai. So tension-free rahai. 

There is no point in respecting this kind of people. What have they done for you to show your tameez? Badteemazi ka jawab tameez seh won't work with this kind of people at all. Just do you. 

Body shaming in Pakistan is the worst thing ever. I avoid social gatherings with this kind of backward uncles and aunties. A fat person is struggling with so many unforeseen circumstances and self-love is hard.
07/11/2024, 4:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: But honestly, sometimes family and close friends can feel more like adversaries than allies. There’s this unsettling assumption they have—that just because they’re close, they’re entitled to a say in everything: HOW YOU LIVE, WHAT YOU DO, and even how you think. They push their unsolicited advice or opinions under the guise of “helping” or “caring,” yet often, it’s more about their own need for control or validation than any real support.

Mentally, this can be exhausting and damaging, especially when you’re trying to establish boundaries. This sense of entitlement often comes from a place of insecurity or the need to assert authority and it's important to acknowledge that. They might be projecting their own fears or frustrations onto you, trying to shape your life to fit their view of the world, which is something NOT ON YOU, but them... It’s a tough cycle because, while they may mean well, the reality is it can leave you feeling trapped, unheard, and disrespected.

This is precisely why I choose to cut people off. It's very harsh, I know and most people won't understand this behavior, but it comes from a place of security, atleast for me. I choose to not engage or interact, or give any energy to such toxic people anymore. I do kinda what @923111711757  said above!
07/11/2024, 4:26 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Hahahahahhahaha fit people can act this way ✨💅🏻😂
07/11/2024, 4:29 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Very well analyzed and it’s exactly due to understanding the deep insights of behavior and giving myself all away to people throughout my life. I realized I had none of the energy left for me. 

It’s BEST to keep your energy protected and never engage with anyone with even the slightest hint of ill will for you. 

Khalil Jibran was right when he said “people can’t destroy what they don’t know” 

Better to shock them with your results than convince them with your plans 👍🏻 <This message was edited>
07/11/2024, 4:29 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am sorry, but I am one of those who keep.shaming people
07/11/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Aan aannn...not for their personal stuff but when they keep bringing other people down....
07/11/2024, 4:31 pm - PF - Amna Mir: I do that too cause I’m not attached to others. 

But with family it’s a different scene.
07/11/2024, 4:31 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: And keep advising their magical potions to people for losing weight and what not....improving complexion..increasing height
07/11/2024, 4:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahahahaha
07/11/2024, 4:32 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Gora beauty standards got our elders in a chokehold 💀🤣

Since they can’t be any of that they want others to be this way
07/11/2024, 4:33 pm - PF - Amna Mir: @60193244266 has the male equivalent of the pretty privilege  😂💅🏻
07/11/2024, 4:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahhahaa
07/11/2024, 4:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When I’m gaining weight on a bulk, I start getting such comments too. 

And then I start replying hahahaha
07/11/2024, 4:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fun for me. I like putting people to the sword. 

I feel I’m a bit sadistic that way
07/11/2024, 4:35 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Hahahaha no that’s not sadistic if it’s reactionary. 
It’s sadistic if it’s intentional and actionary. Meaning you’re the first one to pick on someone (which I dearly hope and know you’re not😅)
07/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Adha Pakistan sadistic hai, that’s why ronay dhonay wale dramay hit hain, they like seeing others in pain and seeing others happy aches their bumpy
07/11/2024, 4:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I genuinely keep to myself so nope, it’s never actionary. 

Plus everyone close to me knows me by now so they don’t say much and that’s better for our relationship.
07/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Disrespect them. They deserve it
07/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: bumpy :p xD

Couldn't have come at a better time
07/11/2024, 5:00 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Where are these aunties and uncles when we are suffering? They always have something to say, why you so fat? Why you so thin? How will some guy marry you, you are so tall, or your height is not good enough to be labelled as normal, you are short, your complexion is dark or your complexion is too fair. If that's not the case then they say why so many pimples. If non of the above things then next thing is why you aren't married yet? If married then they say haye is se shadi hovi hai? Shakal dekho oski. Or why not having kids, when you will have more. Aur sab Kuch Ker lo akele suffer Karo tau sab k sab scene se hi ghayab
07/11/2024, 5:01 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: And interesting fact is ab ye sab sirf female nhi sunti Hain, males bechare b sunte Hain.
07/11/2024, 5:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: It sucks, but it's important to recognize this type of stuff as their own projection and insecurities!
IT'S NOT ON YOU, but them!!
07/11/2024, 5:01 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: If a guy isn't going to marry tau ESI stories ayengi that confirms that guy is kind of LGBT lol
07/11/2024, 5:03 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I heard one more thing from these aunties, "beta why you count pronounce "s" sound sharply?" I mean what the hell?
07/11/2024, 5:03 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Matlub Kuch bhi
07/11/2024, 5:14 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: in my years I've learned to accept that people who are stuck in such petty crap, unki duniya bus itni he hai. clothes, weight, shakal and what not. and I've spent a major part of my life overthinking their comments too but now i tell myself k my world is bigger than just this and there's alot that i need to do or accomplish so they can enjoy living in their menial issues while i focus on important stuff. 
and stop trying to understand or reason with them 😅 you'd just be wasting words and energy. wo becharay kum aqal hein xd
like silence is my best defense against the world too. you just vibe different. and thankfully (THANKFULLY) i now have a community of people like that too. 
so yay 🎉

07/11/2024, 6:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do you know what fries were they? 

10 fries would be 60-80g.
07/11/2024, 6:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
This is the brand I use.
07/11/2024, 6:21 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: <Media omitted>
Can you let me know the approximate calories in this, or how do I track
07/11/2024, 6:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: 4-5 tbsp boiled rice (about 60-75 grams): ~80-97 calories
1 piece chicken wing (medium size): ~43 calories (idk why i think its chicken wing)
1 tsp oil (about 5 ml): ~40 calories
07/11/2024, 6:29 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: I usually check in all the ingredients used but had lunch outside today so I was bit confused , this was wing and chest combined so I just took the boneless part
07/11/2024, 6:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh then use nandos breast
07/11/2024, 6:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Was it deep fried?
07/11/2024, 6:31 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: No it was mandi
07/11/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: How are you people tracking it...?
07/11/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I mean over excel sheets?
07/11/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Or over apps ?
07/11/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Thank you, I’ll look for its pack. And try adding in again
07/11/2024, 6:37 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: My fitness pal
07/11/2024, 6:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use any frozen fries ki entry. Opa fries ki works too
07/11/2024, 6:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 80g cooked rice
160g cooked chicken thigh
3tsp oil
07/11/2024, 6:57 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Did that and made another food entry of sabrosso chicken poppers too.
07/11/2024, 7:12 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 3tsp in this small portion?😮
07/11/2024, 7:15 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Yeah the rice did seem a bit oily 😶‍🌫️
07/11/2024, 7:28 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Different apps. Eg. macros first or My fitness pal.
I personally use Macros first to log daily meals
07/11/2024, 7:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 for chicken. And 1 for rice.
07/11/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: So are all paid ?
07/11/2024, 7:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Each of these apps offers both free and premium versions—we use the free one
07/11/2024, 8:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, you don’t have to pay for any of these apps.
07/11/2024, 8:04 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: oh God ... i am so naive in all of these things
07/11/2024, 8:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine. We’re all here to learn

07/11/2024, 9:15 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Hello, just a quick question... Are the workouts per day or per week ?
07/11/2024, 9:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Same for steps
07/11/2024, 9:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Workouts/per week
Steps/per day
07/11/2024, 9:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you do 2 workouts per week and hit 5k steps everyday, you'd select Light Exercise
07/11/2024, 9:21 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I go to the gym 3 to 4 days a week and my current target is 10k steps, which some days i achieve and some days don't... So i selected moderate is that ok ?
07/11/2024, 9:24 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: What if we do 5k steps and go to gym 4 times a week along with that?
07/11/2024, 9:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s definitely light exercise.
07/11/2024, 9:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Both light and moderate are ok. 

You can play it safe and select light if the goal is to lose weight.
07/11/2024, 9:26 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Okay I'll do that
07/11/2024, 9:26 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Since the calories i got are 2k+
07/11/2024, 9:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: These calculators are just a starting point, giving you a baseline to work from—so don’t stress too much about choosing the “perfect” one. The real progress comes from starting with a set baseline and then making adjustments over time based on your tracking data, feedback, and insights.

07/11/2024, 9:34 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Currently my steps are around 2-3k per day as I have a remote job .  I am trying to go to the gym 3 days a week ( doing 30mins 12 incline treadmill at 4pmh) and strength training a bit. If I keep that up for now + increase my steps to 10k do you think thats a good enough starting point? Can you also advise me on how I can combat low energy levels and lethargy?
07/11/2024, 9:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Fb
07/11/2024, 9:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, increasing your steps and keeping up with three gym sessions a week is a great foundation. If you're currently doing 2-3k so even doing 5-6k will be great as well! Studies show that regular movement and moderate exercise boost energy, improve mood, and enhance cardiovascular health, so don't just focus on 10k. Do what you can, but slightly better than the previous session.

For low energy, aim for balanced meals with protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats. Stay hydrated and try for 7-8 hours of quality sleep to keep your energy steady throughout the day.

How many meals do you have in a day?
07/11/2024, 9:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s not showing in the pending posts list. You can also check from your profile. If you still don’t see it, we may have already responded to it, or it might not have posted properly. 🤷🏽‍♂
07/11/2024, 9:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I posted mistakenly on my own profile 🤦🏻‍♀️

Now my friends can see
07/11/2024, 9:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Aww, it's okay! It happens.

I've mistakenly posted Admin stuff on this group so many times. Haha. 🙈
07/11/2024, 9:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sooo many times hahahahhaa
07/11/2024, 9:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: HAHAHAHH
07/11/2024, 10:04 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i apologize if this sounds like a dumb question 
but do toddlers need air fried stuff? i mean rather than deep frying their nuggets would it be healthier to air fry them? someone around me said so, just wanted to confirm.
07/11/2024, 10:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not a dumb question at all—it’s actually a common one! Air frying is generally a healthier option than deep frying because it uses much less oil, which means lower fat and calorie content. For toddlers, it’s best to limit deep-fried foods where possible, so air frying nuggets or other foods can be a good alternative.
07/11/2024, 10:06 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: but given their energy levels, dont they need the calories?
07/11/2024, 10:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nuggets are made with bread crumbs (carbs), meat (protein), some fat and each nugget has about 55-65 calories
07/11/2024, 10:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's got enough calories already!
07/11/2024, 10:08 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: okay
07/11/2024, 10:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: If the toddlers struggling to eat then sure, you can enhance their calories/per meal by adding olive oil, etc.
07/11/2024, 10:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: But if they are able to eat just fine, you can give them whatever
07/11/2024, 10:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: And in this case, both airfried and deep fried food have its place
07/11/2024, 10:09 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: got it, thankyou for explaining
07/11/2024, 10:14 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Tracking raw minced beef but there are quite a few option on mfp, does 2 cal per gram make sense?
07/11/2024, 10:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not really!!
07/11/2024, 10:15 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: What’s a fair ratio?
07/11/2024, 10:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Can you show me the options on MFP? I think I am a bit confused
07/11/2024, 10:18 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: <Media omitted>
07/11/2024, 10:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: 4th one seems more accurate to me
07/11/2024, 10:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: 2cal/1g is okay too, that just means it has very less fat content
07/11/2024, 10:20 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I have to consume 150 gns of carbs
07/11/2024, 10:20 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Why is it sounding too less
07/11/2024, 10:21 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: <Media omitted>
07/11/2024, 10:21 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: I usually use agave for my coffee. What’s a better/less calorific alternative?
07/11/2024, 10:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any sweetener like canderal or sucral.
07/11/2024, 10:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: I use Sucral
07/11/2024, 10:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Have you posted this on the group?
07/11/2024, 10:23 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Yepppp on Facebook  ..you altered my protein ro 100 gms
07/11/2024, 10:28 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Wat about stevia ?
07/11/2024, 10:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's also fine, as well as MonkFruit
07/11/2024, 10:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: They're all zero calorie sweeteners
07/11/2024, 10:30 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Since stevia is branded as natural sweetener i thought its better than aspertme or any other sweetener <This message was edited>
07/11/2024, 10:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Stevia is a natural sweetener with little to no calories, like sucralose or monk fruit. While it’s plant-based, all these zero-calorie sweeteners are safe in moderation. Personally, I dislike the taste of aspartame and stevia, but sucralose works best for me. It really comes down to personal preference!
07/11/2024, 10:34 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you for explaining
07/11/2024, 10:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: 🙏🏽
07/11/2024, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. So you can now increase carbs to 210.
07/11/2024, 10:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, there’s actually more research behind aspartame than stevia. 

They’re all safe though.
07/11/2024, 10:43 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: I have 3 meals but they are like 3-4 hours apart and quality sleep is not possible atm with a baby😅 I only get about 4-5 hours
07/11/2024, 10:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Probably why you feel low energy...  because you're not getting enough sleep/rest/recovery
07/11/2024, 10:46 pm - You added Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo)
07/11/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Thankyou! Ill try to incorporate this

08/11/2024, 12:08 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Hi I posted all my meals for today on Facebook. With macros . 

My question is . My total calories are usually within 1300 . I'm stuffed right now. When I started eating healthy I was on deficit. And been on it. I don't lose any weight eating like that anymore. I do eat more on weekends when I eat out or get takeaway.
08/11/2024, 12:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Some days I have dessert so the calories increases
08/11/2024, 12:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: To lose weight if I try to lower the calories. It effects my energy levels.
08/11/2024, 12:10 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Please assess on the group. I tried to put all the small nibbles I took apart from my meals.
08/11/2024, 12:10 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Tracked on the app
08/11/2024, 12:10 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I find tracking really really time consuming
08/11/2024, 12:25 am - Taha Ahmed: I completely understand how frustrating it can be when your energy levels dip and weight loss stalls. 

It seems like you’re eating a lot of voluminous foods (low-calorie, nutrient-dense), which can leave you feeling stuffed even with a 1300 calorie intake. To hit your target calories without feeling overly full, we might want to focus on adding in calorie-dense foods like nuts, seeds and oily foods. This way, you can increase your calorie intake without significantly increasing the volume of food.

That said, going below 1300 calories could definitely affect your energy levels and long-term progress. So, I’d suggest we look into other ways to increase your calorie expenditure without needing to eat less. You could incorporate new activities, like walking, strength training, or maybe even something fun like gardening. It’ll allow you to expend more energy and keep your calorie intake higher, which might also give you the flexibility to enjoy a wider variety of foods without feeling restricted.

Another thing I’d recommend is focusing on building muscle. Having more muscle increases your BMR, meaning your body burns more calories at rest. This will help you eat more while still maintaining a deficit, ultimately leading to better fat loss results.

Lastly, I can see that protein intake might be a bit lower than what you need, possibly because of your current food choices. Protein is important for not just muscle recovery and satiety but to also promote hormonal regulation, etc. too (increased intake might improve your appetite overtime), and hitting your target will help you feel fuller and prevent muscle loss. Now that's something we can do without drastically changing your food choices.

Also, plesae understand that you don’t have to track every single meal forever, but doing it for a little while helps us understand your habits so we can make the right adjustments.

I really hope this makes sense!! :)

08/11/2024, 12:25 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sorry posted now . Facebook notification just came in.
08/11/2024, 12:25 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: It was stuck
08/11/2024, 12:30 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I am mostly on my feet all day. In london usually there is no house help. We have to do our laundry . Walk to school and library , do our groceries , cleaning and cooking. Almost all the work. 

I'm trying to increase my strength training gradually. I started working out in May this year .
08/11/2024, 12:31 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: When I lost weight . I was not even working out. I just did daily steps and diet control
08/11/2024, 12:31 am - Taha Ahmed: Hmm okay it's a little tricky but I think we'll have to increase your energy intake, focus on weight training, help you build more muscle mass
08/11/2024, 12:31 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will track . Not a problem. I understand
08/11/2024, 12:31 am - Taha Ahmed: You've probably lost a lot of muscle mass because of dieting this way and not engaging in any strength training
08/11/2024, 12:32 am - Taha Ahmed: Unfortunately a lot of people go this route. While it's okay, it's not good for long-term results
08/11/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
08/11/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I realized that too
08/11/2024, 12:34 am - Taha Ahmed: Let’s take it step by step.

First, let’s focus on increasing your calorie and protein intake, and adding strength training to your routine. Staying consistent with it is key for us.
08/11/2024, 12:34 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Didn't know about that
08/11/2024, 12:35 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And my core is very very weak
08/11/2024, 12:35 am - Taha Ahmed: And let's move away from weight loss for a couple of weeks!
08/11/2024, 12:37 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also. You said I start eating nuts and seeds. Wouldn't I consume more fat
08/11/2024, 12:38 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Where my fat intake should be only 56g
08/11/2024, 12:40 am - PF - Sadia Naeem: And let me add strict type of diet is sometimes annoying for others also
I have some guest over while making tea for him I added sugar and he refused to have it
08/11/2024, 12:40 am - Taha Ahmed: These are just baseline numbers, so no need to fixate on exact amounts! Focus primarily on hitting your protein goal, as that’s key. You can adjust fats and carbs based on what you enjoy — if you’re adding more nuts and seeds, simply balance by slightly reducing carbs elsewhere. It’s all about flexibility!
08/11/2024, 12:41 am - Taha Ahmed: Some people can be a bit finicky about these small things—best not to invite them next time! 😄 And honestly, you should've enjoyed the tea right in front of him; nothing like a bit of silent rebellion!
08/11/2024, 12:42 am - Taha Ahmed: And honestly, I'd have just told them to politely f*** right off! 😂
08/11/2024, 12:42 am - PF - Sadia Naeem: Now he is having full mug of full fat milk 200ml without 1tsp
08/11/2024, 12:43 am - PF - Sadia Naeem: Ohh some day I will😆
08/11/2024, 12:44 am - PF - Sadia Naeem: Tea
08/11/2024, 12:48 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: What can I have for more protein. I can't take protein shakes as my doctor told me not to. I have kidney stones too 🙈

So many health issues
08/11/2024, 12:59 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Bro 😂😂
08/11/2024, 1:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chicken, beef, fish, Greek yoghurt, lentils, beans, cheese are a few options.
08/11/2024, 1:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What did the doctor say about the kidney stones?

08/11/2024, 10:33 am - PF - Sahar Khan: You sure about this.... I can do that...? This would increase calories too..No?
08/11/2024, 10:35 am - PF - Sahar Khan: Same here.... its so mind numbing...I am going with gms for now.... @923343773307 ....is that right? That's what I was doing earlier too...
08/11/2024, 10:38 am - PF - Sahar Khan: I am facing the same issue...not very very weak...but yes I want to loaf more strength here @923343773307

53 gram paratha, would have how many calories ?
40 gram egg omelette 

And I cup (around 200-250ml ) home made tea with 1tsp sugar
08/11/2024, 11:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Meal before workout, 1-2 hours gap is fine. 

Post workout, you can have food immediately as well. 

There’s no specific rule but generally pre workout meal should be mostly carbs and protein. Fats take longer to digest and can make you feel uneasy when working out. 

Post workout can be a more balanced meal with protein, carbs and fats.
08/11/2024, 11:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. We’ve reduced protein. So using the same calories for extra carbs. Total calories remain the same.
08/11/2024, 11:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes, grams is what you should use.
08/11/2024, 11:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100 calories for the paratha 
1 egg
1 tsp oil for the egg

Tea (milk and sugar)
08/11/2024, 11:26 am - PF - Sahar Khan: Ok great then!
08/11/2024, 11:27 am - PF - Sahar Khan: Just for my understanding...all of this stands for 100 calories?
08/11/2024, 11:32 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: no, it's 100 *just* for the paratha.
and you'd log the other items separately in your app
08/11/2024, 11:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No no, just the paratha estimation.
08/11/2024, 11:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: The entire meal would be 250-300
08/11/2024, 11:56 am - PF - Ahmed Rao: Any tips on dealing with sore muscles. Can’t even straighten my arm atp.
08/11/2024, 12:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: How/why did you get this sore? 😬
08/11/2024, 12:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Are you getting enough sleep (rest and recovery), eating enough protein?
08/11/2024, 12:01 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Prolly because its only my second day
08/11/2024, 12:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: That makes sense! But the plans we've given you start very small (in terms of intensity)
08/11/2024, 12:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Did you lift heavy weights and followed the given reps/sets?
08/11/2024, 12:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I have had this issue since I was a teenager. He said protein from diet is ok for now. But no protein shake .
08/11/2024, 12:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: 🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
08/11/2024, 12:03 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: <Media omitted>
Its my first day at calorie counting, in breakfast i had 
3 tbsp of uncooked oats cooked in half cup waterand half cup of milk, topped with banana and a tbsp of peanut butter and some seeds.
I have logged this in the app, but can you tell how much approx calories a bowl of oats have?
08/11/2024, 12:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Protein is safe to consume and doesn't cause kidney stones. Whether it's protein from chicken or protein powders. 

Your body can't tell the difference!
08/11/2024, 12:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Unless you're not drinking any water and are dehydrated af, all day, everyday. In that case anything can cause kidney stones, esp., green leafy vegetables like lettuce, spinach, etc
08/11/2024, 12:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you share how you logged it in the app
08/11/2024, 12:16 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: <Media omitted>
08/11/2024, 12:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Tricep kickbacks 
Seated dumbbell presses 
Squats weighted 
Courtesy lunges 
Farmers walk 
Kettlebell swings  
Mobility exercises before and after 
And cardio for 15 minutes 

Is this ok ??
08/11/2024, 12:17 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Do we have a workout program for ladies who wanna restart strength training with just minimal weights and then progressively increase ?
08/11/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: They want to rule out if it's uric acid stones . I'm on the waiting list to get surgery soon. They going to test them
08/11/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I drink 1 to two liters
08/11/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Water
08/11/2024, 12:21 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am taking one scoop of protein on my workout days... I mean I do strength training 3 days a week... so on those 3 days... acting a bit miserly .... to save it for strength training... cardio days... I am not consuming it... although... I should...but what do you say?
08/11/2024, 12:21 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Not exactly I would say
08/11/2024, 12:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: @447723402200 it's okay for what exactly? what are you trying to achieve with this workout? 

Without much context, it just looks like a bunch of exercises put together along with some mobility and cardio at the end
08/11/2024, 12:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Strength
08/11/2024, 12:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Full body workout
08/11/2024, 12:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: This is what I wanna know
08/11/2024, 12:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: We don't specifically have a program JUST for ladies yet, but we are making new plans and can design one or two just for the females
08/11/2024, 12:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I downloaded the sheets yesterday
08/11/2024, 12:24 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But these kind of exercises I was doing before
08/11/2024, 12:25 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also , I haven't touched the barbell yet
08/11/2024, 12:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Got you.
Well in your case, with kidney stones, you should be drinking more water. 1-2 liter probably won't be/isn't enough
08/11/2024, 12:25 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm scared
08/11/2024, 12:25 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If the form is not right
08/11/2024, 12:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's really hard , I'm always in the bathroom 😭 I am drinking 1.5 to 2 sometimes . Tea is separate not included in this.
08/11/2024, 12:28 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 100g of cooked roti has 194 calories?
08/11/2024, 12:30 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Will have more than that, probably around 250-300 calories!
08/11/2024, 12:30 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: I am not sure if this is authentic information but I heard if you’re peeing alot ( with more water intake) it means your body is not really hydrating or absorbing the water. It’s just directly getting flushed out. I tried adding electrolytes in it then and Idk if its a placebo effect or something but it did help 😅
08/11/2024, 12:30 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @923343773307 please support
08/11/2024, 12:31 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Like I do feel more hydrated and noticed that I am going to the less washroom so idky would also like some clarity on this too
08/11/2024, 12:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: No one *needs* protein powders—they’re called supplements for a reason. If you have a varied diet that lets you hit your protein needs through whole foods, you’re set. For example, I reach my 160g goal with meat, dairy, and eggs, so I don’t use protein powders (plus, it’s hard to find good options here in Karachi).

Protein powders just make it easier to reach your target since they’re concentrated and low-calorie. 

For you, you can take it whenever—ideally, keep it consistent on both training and rest days. 😊
08/11/2024, 12:32 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @60193244266 I have a condition, when I wake up in the morning my heels pain real bad, that I cant even walk for a few minutes...it gets normal in a while but the pain generally stays there in low intensity... can it be uric acid, can this be my protein intake ??
08/11/2024, 12:33 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): U should get ur uric acid chkd
08/11/2024, 12:33 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Thanks hun!
08/11/2024, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hydration needs vary from person to person. Some people do fine with 1 liter a day, while others may need 3 or more—it all depends on factors like your environment, activity level, and how much you sweat.

A simple way to check if you’re hydrated is by looking at the color of your urine; lighter generally means you’re well-hydrated, while darker may mean you need more fluids.
08/11/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I have this too. It's called plantar fascitis. But I'm not doctor . So possibility could be something else
08/11/2024, 12:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not true! Haha
@60193244266 what do you have to say about this?^
08/11/2024, 12:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ye dadi ammaon ke zamanay ki koi myth lag rahi hai

08/11/2024, 12:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you have flat feet, plantar fasciitis, or shoes that don’t support your arch well, you might feel pain similar to this—it’s not always due to uric acid. 

To check if it’s related to uric acid, look for swelling around the ankles. If your feet are swollen and hurt but feel better in the morning after waking up, it’s likely not uric acid. Pain/swelling from uric acid buildup usually lasts throughout the day. (I've had both the issues at some point in time)
08/11/2024, 12:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because you’re doing a 5 day plan that isn’t for beginners lol
08/11/2024, 12:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think it's really time you delete your account and start a fresh. Haha!

Start with following Sameet and Me so you've a curated profile of evidence-based coaches and their content.

Btw! How to count this Aalu paratha 🫥 i had half of it! 😬 @923343773307
08/11/2024, 12:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also just to let you all know. Uric acid is linked to purines. Not protein.
08/11/2024, 12:44 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Had no idea that was the case, I can switch to 3 day with 2 days just for cardio. But anything I do for the sore now?
08/11/2024, 12:45 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Oh really... no there is no swelling... I don't have flat feet.... it can be because of my shoes...because when I walk with my sneakers on, they are painful I mean.. they are good ones... but I think they have lost their  functionality now....I can link whenthe dots now may be.... whenever I go for a walk, its painful... not when I am roaming in markets or elsewhere
08/11/2024, 12:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For soreness,the best things are sleep, protein intake and hydration
08/11/2024, 12:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Definitely not the right shoes then
08/11/2024, 12:45 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: That's right.. just googled!
08/11/2024, 12:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d go with 450 calories.
08/11/2024, 12:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Always am 😂
08/11/2024, 12:47 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): @60193244266 can you pls confirm this? Anya told in some of her previous posts I don’t remember correctly but i think it was  194 per 100g cooked roti
08/11/2024, 12:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also for this, workouts for women and men don’t need to be different. 

The workouts I’ve made are general workouts for full body strength and overall health. 

Workouts change with preferences, for instance women might want to build more glutes and men might want more arms and that’s when workouts can change. 

But otherwise we all can do the same workouts.
08/11/2024, 12:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 50-60g roti is usually 120-150 calories.
08/11/2024, 12:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why aren’t you doing the ones we’ve made? Because this isn’t a full body workout. It’s just tricep, shoulders, and quads / glutes.
08/11/2024, 12:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will do your ones . I downloaded yesterday. I was showing this to tell you . These kind of workouts I was doing on full body days. It's not made my any coach. I used an app
08/11/2024, 12:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Previously
08/11/2024, 12:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay. You’ll see better results from actual full body workouts.
08/11/2024, 12:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will also have difficulty doing some exercises in your program . I have never done before
08/11/2024, 12:51 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: But I didn't walk yesterday...I sit all day because of my work...why did it pain this morning...confused!
08/11/2024, 12:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, guys. 

Please ask these detailed questioned in Facebook so we can do justice to the answers and more people can benefit from them. 

We can link files and workouts there that we can’t do here.
08/11/2024, 12:52 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Sure bro, would post there now.... butttt.. just a random post ?
08/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine. You can record your form and share for feedback. 

There’s also how to do videos linked in the sheet

Tried to improve my breakast.
2 whole eggs with one kns sausage and light cheese slice and no oil. 
With 50 g of cooked roti with half tsp oil. 
And a cup of tea with sucral.
08/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, create a new post for every question.
08/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d say go see a physio for starters.
08/11/2024, 12:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Like barbells never done  . I think my squat form is not perfect as well. . I feel it in my leg and hip joints. I should be feeling in my glutes and quads ??
08/11/2024, 12:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Decent. Should be around 20-25g protein
08/11/2024, 12:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can do it with a DB too
08/11/2024, 12:54 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): My parents have uric acid aur docs nay sab protine  sources limit ker diye hain 😒
08/11/2024, 12:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: It would be best if everyone posted all questions, big or small, in the Facebook group. The WhatsApp chat fills up quickly, so we should reserve it for important updates, urgent queries, and quick questions only. I have some people reached out and told me that they can't ever follow up on WhatsApp chat after work because there are always over 200+ messages.

By posting on Facebook group, we make it it’s easier for everyone to keep track of information and get detailed feedback.
08/11/2024, 12:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I hate saying this. But doctors are idiots. 

A lot of protein sources are high in purines. 
Sources like beef and mutton. 

But we also have protein options without purines. 

Asking people especially elders to not have protein does more long term damage than good. 

But doctors don’t give patients the time neeeded to explain these things
08/11/2024, 12:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you need help with the calories of something, that’s what you use this channel for. 

That doesn’t need to be on Facebook.

During cool down stretches instead of feeling a relief, I feel a muscle pull. I don’t know whether it’s lack of nutrition or something else
08/11/2024, 1:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How come?
08/11/2024, 1:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a lack of strength potentially. I’d recommend starting with the 3 day plan.

08/11/2024, 1:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahh okay. Makes sense. 
Solid tracking btw. Spot on.

08/11/2024, 1:42 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: I did but not regularly
08/11/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I m scared as it's my first pregnancy. I m working out but still scared of what will happen after delivery
08/11/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Would I be able to join back gym or stay active or even get back to shape
08/11/2024, 1:47 pm - PF - Ali Haider: <Media omitted>
08/11/2024, 1:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t worry about that now. We cross that hurdle when we get there. 

Working out now will make postpartum easier though
08/11/2024, 2:17 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: Yes you will InShaa ALLAH
08/11/2024, 2:18 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Can't agree more...they never explain...and that getr offended if confronted
08/11/2024, 2:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Absolutely, Sameet is right! Staying active now not only supports a healthy pregnancy but can also make recovery smoother and help you regain strength after delivery. Focus on doing what feels good for you at this stage, stay active, eat good nutritious food, focus on rest and recovery and you'll be good after delivery too, possibly better than 98% of the women.
08/11/2024, 2:25 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Insha Allah

08/11/2024, 2:52 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: Can you please explain how can I measure rice serving? Like if I've biryani for lunch how will I know how much calories are in the portion I'm eating.
08/11/2024, 2:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Heree are a few ways you can do it:

1. Use a Food Scale: (what most of us do initially)
Weighing your rice (raw or cooked) on a kitchen scale is the most accurate method. For example, 100g of cooked rice typically contains around 130-150 calories, depending on the type. This can help you get an exact portion.

2. Measuring Cups: 
If you don’t have a scale, you can use measuring cups. One standard serving of cooked rice is about 1/2 cup, which usually weighs around 100g and contains about 130 calories. Just be mindful that restaurant portions can be MUCH larger than this.

3. Estimate by Visuals: (Sameet and I call it eyeballing portions, and we have done it so much that we're very experienced with determining portion sizes by eyeballing when it comes to food tracking.) You get better at it with practice. 

4. Hand Portions: If you’re eating out or don’t have tools available, estimate your portion size by comparing it to the size of your palm. A serving of rice should be roughly the size of your fist or a small bowl (about 1/2-1 cup or 100-200g).

BUT... INITIALLY, LIKE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU'LL HAVE TO WEIGH YOUR FOOD FOR A WHILE TO GET ACCURATE ESTIMATES AND LATER YOU CAN ALSO EYEBALL PORTIONS.
08/11/2024, 3:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Here's how I'd track it: If I'm having biryani that's cooked at home, I first weigh the rice portion, then I’ll measure the chicken and add it based on the portion size. For the oil, I’ll estimate how much was used (e.g., a teaspoon or tablespoon). If I’m having raita, I’ll measure the serving size (say, 1/4 cup). For any extra toppings or sides, like salad or yogurt, I'll track those as well. This way, I make sure to account for everything in my meal!
08/11/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: Great 👌
Thank you for such detailed answer.
08/11/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: 100gms...is good for 130 to 150 calories but as I have to keep it within 210 hms...I will be only left with 110 gms of carbs for the rest of the day....one bread slice is 50 gms , if I take 2 in morning...and there you are done with your carbs gor the day...
08/11/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @923343773307
08/11/2024, 3:02 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: But calories are available... so can we up the carbs intake
08/11/2024, 3:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’m not sure how you're tracking your food, but just to clarify—100g of bread usually has around 49g of carbs. So if you’re having 2 slices of bread (about 80g), that's around 40g of carbs, not too much for the day. You can actually fit in quite a lot of food with 100g of carbs!

To help you better, it would be great if you could share a screenshot of your food diary (MFP or MacroFirst) and food pictures so I can give you more precise advice. You can also post them in the Facebook group, and we’ll review it right away!
08/11/2024, 3:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You have 210g of carbs.

100g of rice only has like 35g of carbs in it.
08/11/2024, 3:17 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Whattttt.... ??? How to weigh rice then....we put foods in categories...roti and chawal are carbs and protein is meat and beans etc etc.... I would like to understand how to do it efficiently
08/11/2024, 3:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you using MyFitnessPal to track
08/11/2024, 3:20 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Macros...but I am finding it very overwhelming...so just wanted to go with weighing scale
08/11/2024, 3:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to use the app to calculate how many carbs or protein are in some things.
08/11/2024, 3:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
100g of cooked rice has 29 carbs and 2g of protein.
08/11/2024, 3:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And 130 calories
08/11/2024, 3:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ah, I see where the confusion is coming from! When we talk about food, it's important to know that not everything weighs the same as its macro content.

For example, 100g of rice doesn't mean you're getting 100g of carbs. Rice has carbs, but it also has water, so 100g of cooked rice usually has about 23-25g of carbs. Similarly, 100g of chicken is not 100g of protein—it’s more like 20-25g of protein, depending on the cut, with some water and fat mixed in.

So, when you track food, you’re tracking the weight of the food, but the macros (like protein, carbs, and fats) come from the food’s actual content. You don’t need to memorize this; just use an app or a food scale to make sure you're getting the right portions. Like Sameet has explained above.

I hope this clarifies any confusion you've had! 🙏🏽
08/11/2024, 3:24 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Ok let me try... I am about to eat an aaaloo paratha! With 70 gms of aata
08/11/2024, 3:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'll make a detailed PDF on this and share it with you all over the weekend. Give me a 👍 if you want it!!

OR perhaps a video, who knows! 😅 <This message was edited>
08/11/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Amna Awais: And a sample meal plan also plzzzz @923343773307
08/11/2024, 3:31 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Phuleeeeezzzzzz.... I want to flaunt that I know better 😆
08/11/2024, 3:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: I don’t personally believe in rigid sample meal plans because they tend to become outdated as soon as you start making progress. But what I can do is show you how I structure my meals to hit my calories and macros (which change every day because I like variety!).

Now, this might not be a perfect fit for your goals, but the goal here is to give you an idea of how to create your own meal plans that work for you. The real aim is to teach you how to design your meals and have the flexibility to adapt them day by day. That way, you’ll never be stuck with boring meal plans again. 😊

This is exactly what we’re doing when we help with tracking and food choices. Eventually, you'll be able to make well-informed food decisions on your own.
08/11/2024, 3:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sample meal plans aren’t possible because sample for what? Everyone has different calories. 

This is why we share recipes on the group. You can use those and fit them in your calories
08/11/2024, 3:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly^

08/11/2024, 3:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh okay
08/11/2024, 3:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A good benchmark is to aim for 4-6 servings of fruit and vegetables per day
08/11/2024, 3:58 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Just confirm it once.
I was also using 1tbsp=10g entry but in reality its approximately 15g.

Doesn't make much difference but still...
08/11/2024, 4:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. 1 tbsp is generally 15g
08/11/2024, 4:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: It can all add up and make a big difference!
1tbsp is ~14-15g (depending on what you're weighing)

1 heaping tbsp would be over ~20-25g, best example is Peanut Butter.

@60193244266 is making a really cool video on that to explain it all!

is this tracked right?
08/11/2024, 5:48 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i weighed the bones at the end (saw coach doing that ina video) and that was 4g so 190
08/11/2024, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bones were only 4g?
08/11/2024, 5:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Id rather add 190g of cooked mutton.

And then 3 tsp of oil on top.
08/11/2024, 5:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you had 170g chicken haleem 

I’d track it as 50g cooked chicken
120g cooked lentils 
3tsp oil.
08/11/2024, 5:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d just divide it into 1-2 fruits that were in the chaat.
08/11/2024, 5:59 pm - PF - Amna Mir: 70g chicken raw 
150 gram pulao with Matar 
2tbsp oil 

Is this the correct entry or should I add anything more for the lunch I had ?
08/11/2024, 6:00 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: yes, just one piece

08/11/2024, 6:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you share a picture? 2tbsp oil for a serving is a lot. 

I’d do 1tbsp. 

And for pulao. Maybe do 125g cooked rice and 25g peas.
08/11/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Pin this 🙏🏽
08/11/2024, 6:43 pm - PF - Amna Mir: It’s just an estimate. I didn’t click the picture. Even though the pulao wasn’t oily at all/ moderately cooked

08/11/2024, 9:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s fine. And make it the first exercise of the day.
08/11/2024, 9:39 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: <Media omitted>
Just had a meal similar to this. The picture is just for reference and not actual portion size.

Tracking it as:

130g Cooked Lentil (Weighed)
100g Cooked Rice (Weighed)
1 TSP Cooking Oil (Estimate)

Total Calories: 322 

Makes sense?

08/11/2024, 9:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: One day doesn’t make much of a difference. Your soreness will get better with time. 

And it won’t be this bad the next time you repeat this workout.
08/11/2024, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: With that being said, going for a help can also help recover from soreness.

08/11/2024, 10:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re doing Incline DB on Monday. Then do smith machine just for variation. 

If you don’t like that then there’s no reason why you can’t do DB again (maybe a slightly higher or lower incline this time)

09/11/2024, 1:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 😱

That won’t be enough calories or nutrients and can lead to other issues. 

What did the doctor suggest? Did they mention a diet or anything like that?
09/11/2024, 1:12 am - PF - Maria Ammar: No. She just said why I put on weight quickly. That I m amazed too

I spend 2 to 2 n half hours at gym, and later I try to complete 5k steps if not able to 10k steps. That too only after having breakfast that includes 2 slices of bread and 1 egg. But I can't even absorb that. It gives me worst heartburn that I can't even sleep at night
09/11/2024, 1:16 am - PF - Maria Ammar: That is why I want to start liquid diet. May be it can help ease this issue. But don't know how many calories will be there in it
09/11/2024, 1:16 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: This message was deleted
09/11/2024, 1:21 am - PF - Aman Ahmed: Hi @923343773307 I sent you on a message about some stuff I need guidance on . If you’ve heard it please do get back to me since I’ve joined the group since 4 days but I don’t know how to go about some things.
09/11/2024, 1:29 am - PF - Maham Rafi: Where are the workouts?
I can't find them
09/11/2024, 1:29 am - Taha Ahmed: Hi, I just saw that you messaged me privately. Let me have a listen to your VN and get back to you shortly, as soon as I'm at my work desk. 🙏🏽
09/11/2024, 1:29 am - PF - Amna Mir: (2)
09/11/2024, 1:29 am - PF - Maham Rafi: ?
09/11/2024, 1:30 am - PF - Aman Ahmed: Thank you ☺️
09/11/2024, 1:30 am - Taha Ahmed: Do you mean the training plan we shared earlier?
09/11/2024, 1:30 am - PF - Maham Rafi: Yes please
09/11/2024, 1:32 am - PF - Maham Rafi: Yes... I hsy saw @60193244266 story on instagram and he mentioned workouts
09/11/2024, 1:33 am - Taha Ahmed: Oh the new ones? We're making them plans rn and we'll post them soon
09/11/2024, 1:42 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Go to the files section on the group.
09/11/2024, 1:43 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll probably be less than 1000.
09/11/2024, 1:44 am - PF - Maria Ammar: So what else can I add? Butter milk in daily routine with that or yogurt with potatoes, cucumber and tomatoes?
09/11/2024, 1:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could try that
09/11/2024, 1:58 am - PF - Maryam Furqan: My doctor suggested risek sachet for heartburn during pregnancy.
Plus coconut water helps too
09/11/2024, 2:00 am - PF - Maria Ammar: Risek tau nhi Di mjhe. Coconut water I used to drink in the beginning abhi try nhi kiya
09/11/2024, 2:23 am - PF - Maryam Furqan: Give it a try if you want, it’s better than starving yourself
09/11/2024, 2:28 am - PF - Maria Ammar: Jazak Allah. But is there any quick remedy for now? It's too intense. Can't sleep and have an appointment tomorrow morning as well as class.
09/11/2024, 2:28 am - PF - Maria Ammar: My throat is burning now
09/11/2024, 2:32 am - PF - Maryam Furqan: Elevating your head and back might help
09/11/2024, 2:32 am - PF - Maria Ammar: I m sitting and exhausted now.
09/11/2024, 2:34 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307, I also left you a message, i would appreciate if you could respond it
09/11/2024, 2:53 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Unfortunately there’s no quick remedy but a few things that can reduce the intensity include:

1. No carbonated beverages
2. ⁠No caffeine (probably not having this in pregnancy but if you are then cut back - including tea)
3. ⁠Smaller meals 
4. ⁠cutting back on spicy foods
5. ⁠cutting back on citrus
6. ⁠cutting back on chocolate or other high fat foods
7. ⁠not eating 3 hours before bed 


All of these might not help but some might.
09/11/2024, 2:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s also the low fodmap diet that benefits some with acid reflux or heart burn issues
09/11/2024, 2:55 am - PF - Maria Ammar: What's that
09/11/2024, 2:55 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: But since this is linked to pregnancy, you need a temporary solution so asking your doctor for a medicine isn’t a bad idea either
09/11/2024, 2:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know

This explains it well.
09/11/2024, 2:56 am - PF - Maria Ammar: Ah, I need to discuss with her tomorrow again. As it's getting unbearable
09/11/2024, 2:56 am - PF - Maria Ammar: Jazak Allah. Let me check
09/11/2024, 9:59 am - PF - Sana Imran: If I can suggest.. pls keep fennel seeds with you.. and chew few of them.. I had acid reflux since a long time and took so many different medicines.. as your expecting so I don’t think you can use much of them.. try having fennels seeds and see if it can work for you
09/11/2024, 10:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No harm in trying 👍🏼
09/11/2024, 10:06 am - PF - Maria Ammar: Jazak Allah
09/11/2024, 10:06 am - PF - Maria Ammar: I will try them too
09/11/2024, 10:45 am - PF - Dr Bushra: Wish you good health Maria, I'm a mother of two and can totally relate what you must be going through, the last few weeks are the toughest. Hang in there. 👍
09/11/2024, 10:45 am - PF - Maria Ammar: Jazak Allah
09/11/2024, 11:20 am - PF - Aminah Kamran: Salam, what is a good number of steps to aim for every day?
09/11/2024, 11:21 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): This message was deleted
09/11/2024, 11:22 am - PF - Amna Mir: Means I have the same question, hence the number 2.
Sorry gen z chat lingo 💀
09/11/2024, 11:26 am - PF - Amna Mir: <Media omitted>
I apologize to myself and the fitness community for going overboard with the food. 

And now my brain isn’t braining with the calorie calculation. 

Please help 💀😭✨
09/11/2024, 11:27 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I can't forgive you for gulab jamun 🙏🏽
09/11/2024, 11:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many do you currently get
09/11/2024, 11:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d go with something around 900-1000 calories and 50-55g protein. <This message was edited>
09/11/2024, 11:37 am - PF - Aminah Kamran: Around 6-8k
09/11/2024, 11:38 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s decent. Maybe just consistently aim to be close to 8000 daily for now. And then gradually increase to 8k-10k

With that being said 7000ish is not a bad place to be.
09/11/2024, 11:44 am - PF - Aminah Kamran: Thank you!
09/11/2024, 12:43 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Can anyone suggest here any app on mobile for steps counting....I do not use a watch waisay....
09/11/2024, 12:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your phone tracks steps anyway
09/11/2024, 12:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Without an app
09/11/2024, 12:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What phone do you use?
09/11/2024, 12:44 pm - PF - Rohbaan S Ahmad: Recommendation on supplements...currently take vitamin d and omega oil usually daily...and what concentrations
09/11/2024, 12:45 pm - PF - Rohbaan S Ahmad: How's centrum as multivitamins
09/11/2024, 12:48 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Duhhhh...I am using android...Samsung
09/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Go into the Samsung health app
09/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Vitamin D 3000-4000iU per day

Fish oil 1-2g per day.
09/11/2024, 12:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
09/11/2024, 12:53 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Me also using android  Samsung  it have  Samsung health
09/11/2024, 12:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Open that and it’ll have your steps there
09/11/2024, 1:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: There is a medicine called gaviscon . Its antacid. I'm not sure if it's available in pakistan
09/11/2024, 1:23 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Figured it....but will it also count our steps, when we are not even holding our phones?
09/11/2024, 1:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. For that you need a watch or a band
09/11/2024, 1:33 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen joined using this group's invite link
09/11/2024, 2:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Have more yogurt
And try ginger tea with a lil honey, for digestion
09/11/2024, 2:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: We've got both Gaviscon and Mucane syrup for that, but it's always a good idea to consult with a doctor first before starting even these Over The Counter products, especially if you're expecting
09/11/2024, 2:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'm getting to everyone now! 🙏🏽
09/11/2024, 2:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I only consumed it while I was expecting. It's completely safe. But yes . The doctor prescribed it. And it was a game changer. It would be good to ask the doctor.
09/11/2024, 2:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah always a better idea to be safe than sorry.
09/11/2024, 2:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because something that works for you might not for someone else.
09/11/2024, 2:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: You're absolutely right! Even though your doctor prescribed it and it worked well for you, it's essential to remember that each person's case is unique. Recommending a medication that worked for you might not be suitable for others, especially in a public group setting. As coaches, we’re here to guide and support, but for treatments or specific medications, it’s best for everyone to consult a healthcare professional, especially in cases like pregnancy.
09/11/2024, 2:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: And a humble request to everyone—please avoid seeking or providing medical diagnoses or treatment suggestions here. Let’s keep those discussions with the professionals!
09/11/2024, 2:51 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Yeah, I have to add more yogurt to my diet now, as per today's appointment my baby is getting weak as I m not able to eat properly. So have to include yogurt kind of things that will help me get enough protein. Also Dr asked me to stop doing exercises and walk only for 10 to 15 min😔
09/11/2024, 2:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is also why something like the liquid diet is dangerous. I hope the doctor recommended against that too
09/11/2024, 2:53 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Yes. They asked me to do rest. Add shakes and more protein and a tablet before breakfast for heartburn
09/11/2024, 2:53 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: And stop being too active
09/11/2024, 2:53 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: In gym
09/11/2024, 2:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: As for exercise, unfortunately that’s always what the doctors recommend because it’s a safer option for them. 

Since they don’t know the ABC of exercise. 

In my opinion, and based on research you can still lift weights 3-4 times per week for 40ish mins. 

Spending 2 hours is overkill. I do this for a living and I don’t do that.
09/11/2024, 2:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Walking is fine too
09/11/2024, 2:54 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: I m also thinking to atleast continue with 30 min of weight training. Else I will become more lethargic if I leave gym completely
09/11/2024, 2:55 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Thrice a week. As it also helps relieve my body aches. Otherwise I won't be able to move
09/11/2024, 2:55 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: And body will become stiff
09/11/2024, 2:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Should be fine.
09/11/2024, 2:57 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Yes
09/11/2024, 2:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Adding whole fruit smoothies and some protein powder can be a good way to boost nutrients without causing too much discomfort. It can also help increase your overall caloric intake, especially to support your baby's development. Also, try incorporating low-acidic foods like oatmeal, bananas, or yogurt, as they’re usually gentler on digestion and can help with heartburn.
09/11/2024, 2:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just stay away from high impact movements and any movements that has you putting pressure on your belly.
09/11/2024, 3:14 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Could you please recommend which protein powder will be good
09/11/2024, 3:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: Are you lactose intolerant?
09/11/2024, 3:15 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: No
09/11/2024, 3:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Any whey protein concentrate will work as long as you get it from a reliable source and don’t compromise on quality. You’ll find cheaper versions out there, but they're often not authentic. (Unfortunately, there’s a lot of mixing and low-quality products around, so just a heads-up!)
09/11/2024, 3:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I personally used protein works for 3ish years in Pakistan. 

But my favourites are MyProtein, ON and Rule1.
09/11/2024, 3:26 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: That is why I asked for the company names. But I will check the one sameet mentioned. And once I get it I will ask the ratio too
09/11/2024, 3:26 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: <Media omitted>
This us what I use... I ordered from khi
09/11/2024, 3:27 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I thoroughly researched about it and the team that delivered it!
09/11/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I hope it's an okay one...since ON is quite expensive now
09/11/2024, 3:29 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Using same brand whey 80
09/11/2024, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: The reason I didn’t mention specific brands is because there are a lot of counterfeit products out there that look like they’re from well-known brands but actually aren’t. Unless you’ve been using those brands for a long time, it's tough to tell the difference. That’s why I emphasized getting them from trusted sources to avoid any issues!

I once found MyProtein packaged Roasted Channa at Imtiaz, and... MyProtein is a UK-based brand and only sells health and wellness supplements.
09/11/2024, 3:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: You're probably not going to find Myprotein in Pakistan anymore, but brands like ON (Optimum Nutrition) and Rule1 are still available. NitroTech from MuscleTech is also a good option.
09/11/2024, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is protein works, the one I used to use in Pakistan too
09/11/2024, 3:33 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Is this oky?
09/11/2024, 3:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's a good option, yes!
09/11/2024, 3:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Jacked nutrition is a company that you can use. 

I know they import and sell authentic products.
09/11/2024, 3:34 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: It's good honestly,  and the team sourced it originally from UK...there was some authentication available too...like a bar code scan or something
09/11/2024, 3:34 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Stepup 
Being using that app for 2 years
09/11/2024, 3:35 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Used it in Islamabad,  but again things are getting too pricey and out of reach
09/11/2024, 3:35 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Thanks friend
09/11/2024, 3:35 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): On there website there are many options in whey protein section which one to choose?
09/11/2024, 3:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. They sell it directly through their website.
09/11/2024, 3:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do they have ON or Muscletech or BPI
09/11/2024, 3:37 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
This one?

Most reasonable entry?
09/11/2024, 3:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: 4th one I guess (49 cal, 1oz)

Is this reliable entry plus how many tsp of oil to add
09/11/2024, 4:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How many grams are you having
09/11/2024, 4:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to record it based on grams ideally
09/11/2024, 4:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re having a cup size then 2-3tsp oil
09/11/2024, 4:15 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Yes I will log in grams probably  150 g
09/11/2024, 4:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you weighing your portion!?

@923202644880 shared this on the FB group so just sharing this here for educational purposes. 

This label is abit flawed . You can tell by the amount of carbs it has, i.e. practically 0, since it says 34 (mg) carbs and not (g). 1g has 1000mg.

We know paratha is basically flour, and that's mostly all carbs.
So this is what it should look like:
Calories: ~220-250 kcal
Carbohydrates: ~30-35g
Protein: ~3-4g
Fat: ~10-12g

So how can these companies claim that a 80g paratha has about 170 calories? 😂 

The unfortunate and sad reality is, that most food industries in Pakistan aren't regulated, and food labeling is a major issue. The nutritional information they put out is often inaccurate and misleading. It’s a bit of a free-for-all!

This is WHY I don't trust Pakistani food labels. They're way off at times and if you don't know what you're looking at, can leave you pretty frustrated.

That's all! 

Thank you for coming to my TEDx Talk! 🙏🏽

Same is with this Chicken Nuggets label/entry by Imtiaz 

Typically, 1 chicken nugget is about 16-20g max (its weight). Before cooking, each nugget has around 49-50 calories, with 2.5g of protein, 3.2g of fat, and 2.5g of carbs.

3 pieces of it CAN'T HAVE 23g of protein!
09/11/2024, 5:05 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): For frozen I opt for big companies  like k&ns or sabroso ...imtiaz and metros own frozen labels are not trust worthy even ingredients
09/11/2024, 5:13 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I thought imtiaz can be trustworthy but now on A big no.
09/11/2024, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They fucked up here. 34g hoga and 34mg likh diya and then no one bothered to check.
09/11/2024, 5:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, but it seems like every label has magic 170 calories in it
09/11/2024, 5:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: K&Ns and Sabroso are fine. Personally tested.
09/11/2024, 5:37 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): <Media omitted>
I took 50g flour whole wheat and kneaded it for a roti. The perra then weighed 94 grams. So apparently it has 170 calories. So jab mein alag sy flour ni use Kar rahi aur sirf aik perra ly rahi hn of a 100g. How come it has 250 calories
09/11/2024, 5:41 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: <Media omitted>
estimated calories for this please?
09/11/2024, 5:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: 94gm dough has 50g flour and 44g water, possibly oil as well!
09/11/2024, 5:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g whole grain, whole wheat flour has around ~340 calories
09/11/2024, 5:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: So half it would be 170 calories (50g flour). If you added any oil in it while kneading, account for that too!
09/11/2024, 5:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Estimated ~330-425 calories for a 236g portion <This message was edited>
09/11/2024, 6:06 pm - PF - Esha Asad (Saifullah): No oil
09/11/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: @60193244266 and @923343773307 I wanted to ask you guys, in the 5 day workout split what exercises target the spinal errectors
09/11/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: In the back
09/11/2024, 6:39 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: What's that brother...spinal errectors?
09/11/2024, 6:39 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am having severe back pain too...I don't know why though
..
09/11/2024, 6:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: RDL for one.
09/11/2024, 6:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: the key exercises that focus on the lower back and support spinal extension - 
chest supported row (targets both upper & lower back), 
barbell RDLs (lower back, glutes, hamstrings while heavily engaging spinal erectors), 
reverse crunches (primary abs. indirectly engages spinal erectors)

Hack squats or high bar back squats work too (indirectly)
09/11/2024, 6:39 pm - PF - Amna Mir: <Media omitted>
Do I calculate the weight of the air dried  fries before or after being cooked? 
These are 80grams cooked 

And 125g frozen
09/11/2024, 6:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally before.
09/11/2024, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ideally before when possible
09/11/2024, 6:40 pm - PF - Amna Mir: <Media omitted>
And do I enter it as 113 g of air fried chicken poppers or raw chicken and add oil entry separately ?
09/11/2024, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Im gonna go! :p
09/11/2024, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So use the 125g frozen entry. That’s the calories mentioned on the back of the pack
09/11/2024, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahaha
09/11/2024, 6:41 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Okay I did the weight before. Will add that to the entry. 🙏🏻👍🏻
09/11/2024, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are these home made?
09/11/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Amna Mir: No, store bought but air fried.
09/11/2024, 6:42 pm - PF - Amna Mir: *113 gram cooked*

Didn’t measure before since I made for everyone and took out my portion.
09/11/2024, 6:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhhh. Then just estimate
09/11/2024, 6:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 113 would be around 155g raw based on my guess
09/11/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Okay keeping in mind to measure the foods raw for best estimation  👍🏻
09/11/2024, 6:45 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Yaar hum baraf kyun measure kar rahay hain waisay? 😐
09/11/2024, 6:46 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Sorry had to ask even if it's a stupid question
09/11/2024, 7:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Hahaha gud question 👍🏽
09/11/2024, 7:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I think oil bhi hota hoga before cooking maybe thats why
09/11/2024, 8:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s not baraf. 

If you take raw chicken 100g and you cook it. 

It generally becomes around 70g. 

Same for most proteins. 

Rice is the other way around.

100g of rice when cooked becomes around 300g. 

But it’s not exact. 

Depending on how long you cook it for, it could be 250g or even 350g. 

Some foods absorb water when cooking. Some lose water. 

And that’s why it’s always better to weigh things raw.
09/11/2024, 8:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, the calories mentioned on packaging is always for frozen state. Not cooked.
09/11/2024, 8:15 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: Calories will also be affected after wards right? For rice even if we don’t use oil
09/11/2024, 8:24 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: That's helpful...thanks for sharing!
09/11/2024, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. 

100g raw rice will have same calories as 300g (or whatever it becomes after cooking) cooked rice

107 g grilled fish 
Oil ki b koi entry kron ?
Not homemade
09/11/2024, 10:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's probably like 3-4g of oil, so if you want to account for that then go ahead, otherwise just let it be. But given it's baahir ka khana, I'd add 1tsp oil just for the sake of it <This message was edited>
09/11/2024, 10:29 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Okay
09/11/2024, 10:37 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: salivating!!! I havent had decent restaurant/shadi pk food  in ages!!!

09/11/2024, 10:42 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): How is besan cheela made?
09/11/2024, 10:42 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @60193244266 ...as per you achieving protein target  matters more here...so is that ok
09/11/2024, 10:43 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Friend....its basically besan and water ... pan cake kind of batter..with spices that I then cooked as a crepe on a non-stick frying pan with 1 tsp of oil
09/11/2024, 10:45 pm - PF - Sadia Naeem: Hello talha cancelled my subscription earlier but I m still here can you check that(it's not that I don't wanted to be here but my mother raise honest lady😁
09/11/2024, 10:46 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: <Media omitted>
Is this fine for 300g chicken haleem I had?
09/11/2024, 10:47 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I think the besan cheela entry is inaccurate
09/11/2024, 10:47 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: In terms of?
09/11/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Although I sensed the same because there are bo gms available
09/11/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 72 carbs means 72x4=288 cals
09/11/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Then protein 36x4 and 4x9 fats
09/11/2024, 10:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahhaha, thank you for the honesty! 😊 We haven’t booted anyone from the group just yet, even if they’ve canceled or haven’t renewed. Giving everyone the weekend to clear things up if they want to stick around—consider it our “grace period” before Monday’s roll call. 👊🏽😁

09/11/2024, 10:53 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @923343773307 @60193244266 please comment....the purpose to use an app is to be stress-free of all these calculations
09/11/2024, 10:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Looks good, might have more oil, cause of extra "piyaaz ka tarka" that we add. If not then it's good as it is, esp when estimating!
09/11/2024, 10:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: How much besan did you use?
09/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: 50 gms !
09/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Actually the app was not allowing any entry in gms for this....it just had 1 serving...that's it! Nothing else
09/11/2024, 10:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can add ingredients separately. Besan is basically a pulse flour (channa daal ka ata)!

Here's how I'd track besan ka chela:
50 gm gram flour / besan flour / chickpea flour (whatever you can find in the app)
1tsp oil

That's it!
09/11/2024, 10:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100g besan has around ~20-22gm protein
09/11/2024, 10:58 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Perfect let me do that
09/11/2024, 10:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: Using 50gm besan would give you 10-11g protein (not 36g)
09/11/2024, 10:58 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: All else is fine?
09/11/2024, 11:05 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
To all my fellow members new on this journey, allow me to expand on very CRUCIAL point made by our Coach Taha. Do not underestimate the importance of establishing an achievable routine/structure for yourself. That overwhelming feeling some of you may be feeling? Take small steps and implement what you learn here into your daily life and you will be well on your way to progressing forward.

My personal suggestion on top 3 to start with:

1) tracking your calories on a daily basis

2) exercising 2-3 times a week 

3) getting enough sleep

Once you have these down, add other habits on top as you go 👍🏼
09/11/2024, 11:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this looks good. Protein and calories are what matter most.
09/11/2024, 11:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks good.
09/11/2024, 11:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Love this 🔥
09/11/2024, 11:27 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Ohhhh sigh of relief!
09/11/2024, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But for the besan entry, I’d follow what Taha said.
09/11/2024, 11:30 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I corrected actually...lemme show
09/11/2024, 11:31 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: <Media omitted>

how much protein would there be in 4 shami kababs? they were k&ns and weighed 146gm. the app shows zero protein. are the calories right too?
09/11/2024, 11:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
I'd quickly go to their web and see the nutritional label. In this case, 4 shami will have 300 calories, and 22gm protein 

https://kandns.pk/products/kababtemptations/shamikabab.html

when tracking this, I'd account for the oil used in cooking as well!
09/11/2024, 11:42 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: thankyou, shall do that from now on
09/11/2024, 11:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you used 90g then this is solid.
09/11/2024, 11:47 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Tips to relax ? I suffer from stress a lot due to the habit of overthinking 🫠
09/11/2024, 11:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: I talked about managing stress and relaxing here. Idk If you can read this text. I can resend it if it's not accessible! <This message was edited>
09/11/2024, 11:51 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I will try to find it, maybe it was before i joined
09/11/2024, 11:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, most probably!
09/11/2024, 11:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Managing stress doesn’t have to mean just “letting it go”—often, stress gets stored in the body. Here are some effective, body-centered techniques that I have learned in therapy myself (I work with a trauma-informed psycho-somatic therapist for myself) and here's what I learned and that has helped:

1. Box Breathing: Breathe in, hold, exhale, and hold each for 4 counts; it calms the nervous system.
2. Tapping (EFT): Tap gently on acupressure points to release tension and lower stress hormones. (you'll have to explore more as its a more advanced method, but honestly, it does wonders, atleast for me it has!)
3. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Tense and relax muscles from head to toe. It helps releasing stored stress. (ofcourse, it doesn't happen in just one or two sessions, you have to make it a habit/a practice that you consistently follow)
4. Gentle Movement: Activities like tai chi or yoga help ease stress from the body. (TaiChi has helped me significantly after my surgeries when I wasn't able to exercise. It grounded me and helped with focus and letting go of stress- I can share a 5-min YouTube tutorial to get started)

Oh, and Daily Mindfulness Meditation too! Can share a free course on that if anyone wants that I have previously done myself as well.
09/11/2024, 11:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: @447360154390 there you go!^
09/11/2024, 11:52 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you
09/11/2024, 11:53 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Please would really appreciate it 🙏🏽
09/11/2024, 11:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Tai Chi 5 minutes - for beginners: (you may feel stupid doing it the first time, but trust me, it gets better every time and your flows/movement becomes fluid - to me, it's more mental than physical. I try to not rush and just do whatever I am able to. Somedays are great, some days are meh, but again, consistency is what I strive for!)

10/11/2024, 12:19 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): Tai chi real Mai work karta hai kya for stress?
10/11/2024, 12:24 am - Taha Ahmed: Han ji! It can be really effective for stress! It’s a form of martial arts/ mindful movement that helps calm the mind, improve focus, and reduce tension in the body. The slow, controlled movements can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation. 

But isko karne ka purpose STRESS ko fix karna nahi hota, wo as a result change aata hai. And don't expect it to fix your life problems either.

10/11/2024, 12:38 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I would also suggest simple exercise like brisk walking 15-20 mins daily. Speaking from personal experience, while it may not sound like much, this is exactly what I started my fitness journey from. Just walking. Fixed quite a few health issues, lowered my stress considerably and the feel-good feeling after the exercise used to carry into the next day
10/11/2024, 12:38 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @447360154390
10/11/2024, 1:13 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Doing 8k to 10k steps daily for example i cover these steps in 30 mins to 1 hour walk
10/11/2024, 1:13 am - PF - Ali Hassan: And been going to the gym also
10/11/2024, 1:18 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: That's awesome. Then definitely look into the other suggested techniques by Coach Taha
10/11/2024, 1:24 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thanks 🙏🏽
10/11/2024, 1:39 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: for Bulgarian split squats. 
we do 2 sets on leg first and then 2 on the other? or do we alternate?
10/11/2024, 1:44 am - Taha Ahmed: Do one leg first, then switch to the other leg, and repeat for the second set.
10/11/2024, 1:59 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Decent estimate

10/11/2024, 12:12 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): @923343773307 @60193244266 i feel like today my form was wrong in ig incline smith press feeling slight pain while performing other exercise so should i end todays workout session or still try to do?
10/11/2024, 12:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Where exactly is the pain—in your shoulder, back, or somewhere else? Any idea what might have caused it, like your grip, angle, or maybe overextending? It’s great that you’re paying attention to form. 

Now you can continue your workout, but let’s be cautious—avoid exercises that stress the same muscle group or joint, esp your shoulder. Try shifting to lower body work, a walk, cardio, or even some stretching if it feels manageable.
10/11/2024, 12:18 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Neck and back
10/11/2024, 12:19 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I was doing incline press on smith machine first time so i think angle
10/11/2024, 12:20 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): In the plan remaining is back and chest while doing those feeling the pain and I did lower body yesterday.
10/11/2024, 12:21 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Alright thanks.
10/11/2024, 12:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's a good idea to avoid further straining your body. You can switch to cardio for a bit, or just a walk. Take it easy today and allow your body to rest and recover.

Also, post about it in the FB group and we'll explore more together. One of the big reasons we get these sort of strains is when we've not slept or recovered properly.
10/11/2024, 12:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And maybe record your set next time so we can give you feedback on form
10/11/2024, 12:28 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Post the same messages in group?
10/11/2024, 12:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can either copy-paste or write a proper post, explaining what you did, what your angle was like, how it felt, what the pain's like, how much weight did you lift, if it was easy to move that weight on smith, etc.

Be as thorough as possible!

And if you recorded yourself performing this exercise, post that too!
10/11/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I could share in future only if you add any female trainer in the community.
10/11/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Okay i will
10/11/2024, 12:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We might have some updates coming on this soon 😱😱😱
10/11/2024, 12:45 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Sameet and talha  plz open my eyes on binge eating impact on calorie  deficit  .....like I had family  breakfast  today and I tracked some of my food but how to track one bite humus or pudding or a bite of apple salad
10/11/2024, 12:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Firstly, that’s not binge eating. 

That’s just enjoying a meal with family. 

As for calories, you can just add 150-200 extra calories to your meal to account for those bites.
10/11/2024, 12:48 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I haven't ate any paratha or puri ....had sausage chesse  omelette  and bits of everything  else
10/11/2024, 12:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Another strategy is add everything to your plate. 
Take a picture. 

And then enjoy your meal. You can use the picture to track calories later
10/11/2024, 12:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly what Sameet said above! A lot of times, we mix up overeating with binge eating, but they’re different things. Overeating now and then—especially in social settings—is super normal and not binge eating, so it’s worth being mindful of the language we use. Mislabeling it can actually be unhelpful over time.

As for tracking, you don’t need to stress over every bite! You can take an estimate for those small nibbles, and then just move on without overthinking. Sameet’s example is spot on for how to handle this practically.
10/11/2024, 12:52 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Yes it works but abhi meri plate dekh k sab bol rahay thay u are on diet na 😄 matlab sausage ka salan bana k hotel waloon nay rakha howa tha aur main oil drain ker rahi hoon to I am on diet
10/11/2024, 12:53 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Talha I also binge in normal settings  to wo bhi zara reality chk chahiye
10/11/2024, 12:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sausage ka salan? Yeh kaunsa restaurant agaya hai 😂
10/11/2024, 12:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Explain what you mean by that - that you binge in normal setting? In detail! <This message was edited>
10/11/2024, 12:54 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Raidan  mandi k breakfast main but I had no other good option od protein  rather than eggs and fork say sausages

Just had this nashta -
10/11/2024, 12:55 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Like I know what I have to eat.   daily  I almost have same breakfast dinner  changes but I track in advance to see macro and calories  and have 2 meals but agar husband ya bachoon ka nashta bana hai to paratha 2 bites salan k sath lay liya is tarha
10/11/2024, 12:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: All of that would easily be 1500 calories.
10/11/2024, 12:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could even be higher 🤷
10/11/2024, 12:57 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Wowwwww.....!!!
10/11/2024, 12:57 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Alhamdolilah  I skipped this and channa allo halwa lassi Alhamdolilah  Alhamdolilah  warna Sara din bhuka marna parta
10/11/2024, 12:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But I’d estimate 1000-1200. 

Paratha 150-200
Nihari 400-500
Paye 100-200
Lassi 200-300
10/11/2024, 12:59 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: BTW....I need to admit that I am enjoying this mindful eating through Macros First...thanks to @60193244266 @923343773307 .... I am staying full....doing more than 10,000 steps...always have some carbs left in my target...overdoing fat a little( can't help it yaar, it's peanuts)
10/11/2024, 1:00 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: So kudos to you guys for jacking up my nutrition knowledge and understanding...
10/11/2024, 1:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This still isn’t binging. 

Binging is a different thing where you like control and can’t stop even if you want to. 

This is just bites and nibbles, which is normal. 

AND YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER IT. 

Similar to snacking. 
You can choose to not to it, and this is easier if you have a well rounded meal and aren’t hungry. 

Or you can do it and account for the calories.
10/11/2024, 1:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: That’s not bingeing at all; that’s just regular, everyday eating! Grabbing a couple of bites while making breakfast or having a little taste here and there is totally normal.

A binge is when you lose control and eat thousands of calories in one sitting, often forgetting what you’re doing or where you are in the moment. So if you’re adding around 200 extra calories from small bites, it’s really different from an actual binge, which could be 3,000-5,000 calories or more in one go.

That’s why it’s important to separate overeating from bingeing—they’re not the same.

Aapki idhar udhar se bites lena is completely normal. Don't worry too much about it!
10/11/2024, 1:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And most of all learning about nutrition ✌️
10/11/2024, 1:01 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi: Ahhhh I was thinking, I’m doing good in not having kulcha and full paratha , only had that 3-4 tbsp as paye soup type , and full bowl of nihari with half sy b kam paratha 😱😱😱😱😱 1500 calories damnnnnnf.
10/11/2024, 1:02 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Yep....I mentioned that... and I am all set to learn more!
10/11/2024, 1:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s one day and I’m sure you enjoyed yourself. Try to keep rest of the day lighter on calories and maybe focus on protein. 

And move on.
10/11/2024, 1:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's amazing!

Also, you're not overdoing fat, it's normal to eat more fat one day and carbs the other. As long as you're in your caloric limit and hitting your protein, I don't see anything going overboard. :)
10/11/2024, 1:02 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I had this few years back due to stress and depression  I kept on eating to a level that wanted to puke  my mind knew I am not hungry but I kept eating .....Alhamdolilah  I am out of that phase

How much calories in one puri? Which one here is a better option
10/11/2024, 1:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: ~300 <This message was edited>
10/11/2024, 1:04 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Also, just wanted to check...that the first calories calculated for all of us....were the ones that already calculated the deficit...right?
10/11/2024, 1:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Use the first entry and edit serving size to around 300 calories for one puri
10/11/2024, 1:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, that's right.

10/11/2024, 1:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That will be closer to 150

Can you tell estimated calories in the paratha and this keema so I can adjust my portion accordingly
10/11/2024, 1:13 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: It’s aloo keema so how much should I have
10/11/2024, 1:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: That aalo keema is ONE portion for me lol 😛 and with 1 paratha.

So, how much do you want to have is a better question. 
 
Make your plate, track how many tbsp you use, and then we can tell you how to estimate your calories.
10/11/2024, 1:18 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: I am not that hungry in the mornings so I just took 1 spoon of aloo keema , and will probably have half the paratha
10/11/2024, 1:18 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: <Media omitted>
10/11/2024, 1:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think this is defo more than 1 tbsp
10/11/2024, 1:19 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: No I ment the salan wala spoon 😅
10/11/2024, 1:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weigh your your portion if possible?

The paratha will be 350ish.
10/11/2024, 1:26 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: I have ordered the measuring scale it will be here soon
10/11/2024, 1:26 pm - PF - Hafsa Zubair: The whole paratha or half?

Hello @923343773307 @60193244266 
Any idea about calories and the macros of the pizza slice on the right?
10/11/2024, 1:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: When I go out once or twice a week . I don't track my food that day. Can you please mention if that's ok ? Do I have to track eating out too ?
10/11/2024, 1:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If it's once a week
10/11/2024, 1:34 pm - You changed the group name from "Project FoMo Community" to "Project FoMo - Core Community"
10/11/2024, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'm posting an important message, can you all please wait for 5 minutes before writing another message here?
10/11/2024, 1:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Whole
10/11/2024, 1:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably close to 2000. It’s like a full pizza. 

Guys, it’s also important to understand that yes, you are allowed to eat anything you want when tracking calories. 

But food choices make a big difference to your fat loss goals too. 

Like I would never go for this slice when losing weight. It’s over the top and not needed.
10/11/2024, 1:45 pm - PF - Abdul Manan: Okay thank you 
I had this and 200g of grilled chicken breast for the whole day 

It slightly under my required bulking calories of 2600
10/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. 

If you’re managing portions then it’s fine. 

But if you are going overboard 2-3 times a week then you can easily wipe your entire deficit too
10/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: EVERYONE! Please check out the announcements!
10/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For bulking it’s likely still fine <This message was edited>

Super helpful. Give it a try!

10/11/2024, 8:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's been a busy Sunday with some other commitments, but I'm finally home! I'll be catching up on all the pending posts shortly. Just wanted to say that I appreciate each of you taking the time to make those posts and share your updates. 🙏🏽
10/11/2024, 11:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey FoMo Legends! 👋

Quick heads up: the Weekly Check-In is back on! Thanks to @923028172221  for the nudge to bring it back – let's get this week kicked off strong! 💪

Take 5 minutes to jot down your wins (no matter how small) and any struggles or challenges you’ve faced. It’s not just about tracking progress—it’s about building a habit of reflection (which, trust me, can help us all level up as humans). I’m here to help you make journaling a solid habit (or at least a fun start to it! 😉)

Don’t leave me hanging, please, go to the link given below and drop your check-ins:

https://www.facebook.com/share/1ARAaVv3U3/
10/11/2024, 11:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: P.S. This check-in is all about YOU, not us coaches. Studies show that reflective journaling can significantly increase self-awareness, motivation, and improve mental health (one study found it can help improve emotional well-being and reduce stress by 20%—to me, it's just mind-blowing!). This small habit will help you grow in ways you won’t even realize yet! <This message was edited>
11/11/2024, 12:10 am - PF - Sahar Khan: Would be foinh so tomorrow
11/11/2024, 12:48 am - PF - Amna Mir: As someone with a history with binge eating disorder. This is so true. I didn’t even realize earlier when I ate 2 whole Big Macs and still felt nothing.

That’s how much chokehold  that thing has over you. You literally cannot stop even if you want to.

I wish I had found this community then but I’m still glad I’m getting it now and reaching the ending stages of my goal. <This message was edited>

Guys I have some dumb questions, please don't judge, I am a beginner in the gym thing.

How do I know how much each of this weigh? It's not mentioned on it.
11/11/2024, 12:25 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: 5kg each
11/11/2024, 12:26 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: You can add stacks like 5, then add another it will become 10 and then so on
11/11/2024, 12:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: They're usually around 2.5kg (some gyms have 5kgs)

What Sameet said below! 👇 <This message was edited>
11/11/2024, 12:27 pm - PF - Maria Ammar: Alright. Thanks for correcting me. As the gyms I have been to have 5 each
11/11/2024, 12:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d recommend asking the gym trainer or staff.

It depends on their brand of machine they have.
11/11/2024, 12:41 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: No trainer at the gym I'll ask the staff
11/11/2024, 12:44 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 did barbell rdl’s, feeling it in my lower back, is that normal? Or issues with form? <This message was edited>
11/11/2024, 12:51 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: <Media omitted>
Week 1 Day 1
 Please tell me what is Rep Result, also correct me here each set will have 2 rounds of 10 reps right?
11/11/2024, 12:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: So,

Rep Goal = the number of reps we've given you
Rep Result = you're supposed to write how many reps YOU were able to do/perform in each set

One set = 10 reps (but if you're doing an exercise like lunges, you'll do 10 reps on each leg and then switch to the other)

For chest press like exercises, 1 set = 10 reps
For lunges, single leg squats, etc., 1 set = 10 reps (each side) - so total 20 reps 

I hope it makes sense
11/11/2024, 12:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: RDL does target to lower back to a small extent especially the spinal erectors. 

If you want just record a set and we can look at form.

Had leftover bbq chicken from yesterday. 

Made a high protein pizza today. 

This is where having protein prepped can be super helpful. 

Another example, if making keema, I’ll make 3 servings together. 

So I have 2 servings stored and if I want a quick meal I can just make rice or roti and be done.

My first attempt at completing a calorie deficit day.  Is it any good @60193244266 @923343773307
11/11/2024, 11:08 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): <Media omitted>
11/11/2024, 11:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: How many calories did you actually consume?

Also, turn off 'Calories from Exercise' in your app settings. 
When you're in a calorie deficit to lose weight, we don’t want to add back the calories burned from exercise. It can make tracking confusing and slow down results. Exercise is a fantastic boost to our health and helps us build strength and endurance, but for weight loss, we stick to our calorie target without “eating back” what we burn.

11/11/2024, 11:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): Can you share the same to turn of calorie from exercise.
11/11/2024, 11:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): Ok
11/11/2024, 11:30 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): Done.
11/11/2024, 11:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nonsense. I watched the first clip and their conclusion is completely wrong.
12/11/2024, 12:15 am - Taha Ahmed: Do you want to see what all you can eat to hit ~150 of protein/per day and in under 1600-1700 calories?

Just give me a "👍🏽"
12/11/2024, 12:21 am - PF - Sahar Khan: Ohhhh for sure!
12/11/2024, 12:22 am - PF - Sahar Khan: I take protein shake and still I am not hitting 100 gms of protein....I mean too much hojaata hay yaar
12/11/2024, 12:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. It’s just that humaray culture main we aren’t used to eating protein
12/11/2024, 12:24 am - PF - Abeeha Ali: Shukr hai🙂
12/11/2024, 12:28 am - Taha Ahmed: Hitting protein can seem challenging, especially when we aren’t used to eating protein-rich foods regularly like Sameet said. But trust me—you can actually eat a lot and still stay within your calorie goal. 

Bus desi style ki dishes ko thora sa dekhna parega haha, hum loug bohat oil consume kartay hain. Matlab hum apnay salads mai bhi shadeed oil daaltay hain taa'k taste acha aajaye.

It's why we hit our calorie goals before our protein intake
12/11/2024, 12:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: The pizza I made. How many calories do you think it has?
12/11/2024, 12:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I added cheese too

12/11/2024, 12:45 am - Taha Ahmed: The intake is kinda low... Only 800 calories (so it makes sense the protein intake se low too)
12/11/2024, 12:45 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I had a big meal at restaurant yesterday. So in the morning I was full so didn't eat breakfast
12/11/2024, 12:46 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Do I need to eat more or just leave it for today and make it up tomorrow
12/11/2024, 12:46 am - Taha Ahmed: If it's just one day then not really, but if it's almost every day or every other day then yes. It may affect your mood, performance, daily energy levels, etc, quite significantly
12/11/2024, 12:46 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: My mood is always low
12/11/2024, 12:47 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: The food that makes me happy is not good food 🙈

12/11/2024, 1:07 am - Taha Ahmed: Watch out for my message shortly. I am gonna share how you can have loads of protein, good food, lots of volume and in under 1700 calories.

That way you can adjust your portion, actually EAT THE FOODS YOU LOVE, and still hit your goals. <This message was edited>
12/11/2024, 1:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I also get headache after eating food ..specially when I have my first meal .

12/11/2024, 1:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is that insulin spike ?
12/11/2024, 1:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
12/11/2024, 1:47 am - Taha Ahmed: I’ve shared a realistic and flexible but a SAMPLE meal plan on Facebook that can help you hit your protein goals while still enjoying the foods you love!

Two options available.
#1 - 150g protein, 2000 calories
#2 - 100-110g protein, 1500-1600 calories

Remember, this isn’t set in stone—just an example to guide you in adding more protein and balancing your meals. Feel free to tweak it based on what works for you!

Check it out here: https://www.facebook.com/share/19Ky5LVzqT/

I’d really appreciate your feedback, so let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions. I’m here to help!

P.S. The last part of the plan will probably be more enticing for most of you! 😉
12/11/2024, 10:08 am - PF - Sahar Khan: I thought,  being Muslims we eat generally more protein!
12/11/2024, 12:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha, that's not true. Maybe only during Bakra Eid do we even come close to a "protein-rich" diet!

Let me ruin the "Desi diet is healthy" myth for you, though: we’re pretty low on protein the rest of the year. We love to think cooking at home means we’re eating clean or healthy, but, honestly, it’s not the magic ticket we think it is. Most of our beloved sabzi ka saalan and daal dishes are more oil and carbs than anything else, and protein is usually just a supporting character—if it even makes an appearance. 😅😭

And don’t get me started on the oil. If there’s one thing Desi homes never run low on, it’s the pyaar se added oil that sneaks in to clog arteries, rack up calories, and practically erase any nutrient value from the food. One spoonful becomes three in no time, and before we know it, we’re eating a calorie bomb without even realizing it! So yeah, that “healthy Desi diet”... might just need a reality check.
12/11/2024, 12:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Lol. I should've slept more today. 😬

12/11/2024, 1:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Generally, drink more water, add some electrolytes (esp sodium), and eat more perhaps

Edit: I use my maa's totka for this. 1 glass water, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp sugar, and a little lemon juice <This message was edited>
12/11/2024, 1:19 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307  and @60193244266 I think i slightly strained my lower back on Sunday, took a day’s rest, it’s slightly better. So, today i got upper body, wanted your opnion on whether i should push through it because i think i can or not risk it?
12/11/2024, 1:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: First, listen to your body. You know your body best and how much you're able to push through.

If you strained your back, it's a good idea to give it a couple of days rest (rest ≠ completely stop moving). Go do your workout, do some lower back mobility exercises, don't do the ones that directly put more strain on your back, esp with weights.
12/11/2024, 1:24 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: What kind of lower back mobility exercises? Can you give me a example?
12/11/2024, 1:25 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: I was thinking of using a deadlift belt to stabilise my lower back to perform the exercises, is that a good idea?
12/11/2024, 1:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: The basic ones only:

1. cat-cow
2. child's pose with reach (hold the position, walk your hands to the right and hold for a few seconds, feeling a stretch along your left side, then walk to the left, repeat a few times)
3. knee-to-chest stretch (lie down to perform this)
4. pelvic tilts (while lying down, and its one of my favs)
12/11/2024, 1:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d recommend go do the workouts and if a movement causes pain or discomfort just skip that movement or go lighter on it.
12/11/2024, 1:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: It is, if you're lifting very heavy weights. If it's not heavy and it's straining your back because you're not yet able to embrace core properly while lifting weights, then you should improve your form first without adding more weight to it
12/11/2024, 1:30 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: thanks guys, will hit the gym and probably focus on form and mind muscle connection more and then going heavy
12/11/2024, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah. a solid plan. Just remember, progressive overload doesn’t always mean adding more weight each time. 

You can make great progress by adding a few extra reps with the same weight, which still challenges the muscle and builds strength. 

Another way is to slow down your tempo and really focus on the mind-muscle connection—this can make a big difference in how the muscle engages. (eccentric part of the movement)

Keep your form solid, and don't rush to go heavy. Small adjustments can keep you progressing without risking injury! (I learned this after 10 years... )

This advice is for EVERYONE in the group. 💪🏽
12/11/2024, 2:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Just added SOME of the dishes you can make with the options I've given in this post. Check it out if you still haven't! :)

Imagine how easier it'll get for you to hit your protein now while kind of staying under your calorie limits. 🤷🏽‍♂

Be creative!!! 😉
12/11/2024, 2:09 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Wonderful. Thank you Taha ❤️🙌🏼
12/11/2024, 2:13 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: ahaaa.... I completely realise that but for the oil part I think over exaggerate it...if we are cooking a meal in lets say 4 tbsps of oil( that's quite a lot by the way) for 4 individuals, only a spoonful comes for 1 person share!
12/11/2024, 2:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'm not exaggerating. Most people cooking don't even measure how much they're adding. 

You're tracking now so you know there's 4tbsp of oil in the food you're making. 

Trust me when I say this, but people just pour oil from the bottle directly in the pan/wok.

One of my clients used to swear she only used one tablespoon of oil to make her fried eggs each morning. But when I asked her to record a video of her cooking process, we discovered she was actually using closer to four tablespoons. Just that simple adjustment made a huge difference in her daily calorie intake, and she had no idea before tracking it. This is such a common pattern—most people don't realize how quickly the calories from oil can add up when they're not measuring. It's definitely an eye-opener!
12/11/2024, 2:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: How much oil do you think there's in this plate? 

And it's a very small portion of what people usually eat!
12/11/2024, 2:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You should see my mom or my mother in law add oil to food
12/11/2024, 2:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’d think we own Dalda 😱
12/11/2024, 2:35 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi: Haha, agreed, during my learning phase of cooking, i learnt this if one can’t see that glorious layer of oil on top, the food just feels...incomplete.
12/11/2024, 2:37 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi: And then I became that chef who’s like, “Not enough oil? Let’s add some more and watch it rise to the surface like a victory flag, lol. Sometimes, God knows why , despite of adding multiple tbsps of oil, oil doesn’t come on the surface. So add more 🤣🤣.
12/11/2024, 2:42 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi: I learnt from this group, how to track these each ingredient, not each, at least the main ones. Like oil. I never consider that oil either 1tbsp or tsp might have that extra calories.
12/11/2024, 2:49 pm - PF - Maryam Qureshi: And have not seen such group and coaches  , who guide this tiny points  which actually are the main points  for calorie deficit. My ex-nutritionist said me to avoid roti/chapati/bread. And I literally starve myself for one week and avoided these but on 7-8 day I had 2-3 chapati in one meal. Thanks @923343773307  @60193244266 for projecting these points in a very understandable manner 🦋 and writing those essays in details so  a client like me can understand easily rather than googling it or starving myself.
12/11/2024, 3:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: While doing face pull on cable machine my left shoulder making clicking noise. As I mentioned my left side is weaker than my right .
12/11/2024, 3:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
12/11/2024, 3:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: This machine
12/11/2024, 3:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is there any pain?
12/11/2024, 3:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Not much just strain
12/11/2024, 3:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I did mobility befor
12/11/2024, 3:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Before
12/11/2024, 3:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then shouldn’t be an issue. Probably just weakness in the muscle
12/11/2024, 3:14 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am sorry if you misunderstood...I was not saying you are exaggerating 😬....I was saying in general we all do exaggerate the oil part!
12/11/2024, 3:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I completed my set . How can I fix my weaker side ?
12/11/2024, 3:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Even with dumbbells on one side I struggle
12/11/2024, 3:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll just get stronger with time.
12/11/2024, 3:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just need to keep strengthening it
12/11/2024, 3:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Do I need to take lower weight dumbell on one side and heavier on right ?
12/11/2024, 3:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sorry must be a silly question
12/11/2024, 3:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I just wonder if one can do that
12/11/2024, 3:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No no. Not a silly question at all. 

Just keep the same weight on both sides otherwise that can worsen the imbalance.
12/11/2024, 3:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also I'm unable to download workout sheets and cnt find the last time I downloaded the one. I'm doing full body workout on machines. 

Cable machine face pulls 
Single arm exercise 
Cable machine abs on floor 
Legs abductor 
Leg press 
Lat pull downs 

They are fine ?
12/11/2024, 3:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This doesn’t cover a lot of muscle though. 

Go into the Facebook group. Open the files section and you can download from there.
12/11/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I tried four times
12/11/2024, 3:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Done it. It's showing now
12/11/2024, 3:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: You don't have machine only workouts. ?
12/11/2024, 3:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any reason why you want machine only?
12/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: <Media omitted>
Am I doing this thing right? Please guide me
12/11/2024, 3:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes!!
12/11/2024, 3:42 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: Oh Alhamdulillah 
Thank you 🤩
12/11/2024, 3:42 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: One more question 
Is it safe to use C4 as a preworkout?
12/11/2024, 3:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but if you have it 7-8 hours before bed then it might disrupt sleep
12/11/2024, 3:45 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: I have used it for quite long before and I never had any problems with sleep.
12/11/2024, 3:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine then
12/11/2024, 3:45 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: Thanks
12/11/2024, 3:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: I did misunderstand that bit.Thank you for clarifying. 😊
And yes, we all exaggerate, not just oil bit but other foods as well. 
Like chocolates, sweets, candies, etc., esp Mithayi like gulab jamun.
12/11/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Yessss...so true .. so I believe we need to go little less hard on oil fats! They do bring in lot of goodness in moderation
12/11/2024, 4:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm scared of incorrect form
12/11/2024, 4:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: These exercises you planned I don't think I can do all of them.
12/11/2024, 4:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm willing to learn
12/11/2024, 4:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But I'm very shy at the gym. With machines it's quite controlled. I do free weights when I'm confident.
12/11/2024, 4:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Make a post Facebook and I’ll recommend substitutions for the ones you want to change
12/11/2024, 4:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Weighted squats I hurt myself once and lunges . So I start off without weights
12/11/2024, 4:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will do that tonight.
12/11/2024, 4:04 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Can you please tell me what time is there right now ?
12/11/2024, 4:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Where?
12/11/2024, 4:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Pakistan
12/11/2024, 4:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: 4:14pm in Pakistan
7:14pm in Malaysia
12/11/2024, 4:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Who is in Malaysia
12/11/2024, 4:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sameet?

12/11/2024, 9:49 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I am dropping  a dumb question  ....height kis age tak increase  hoti hai and does  workout  help in that regard <This message was edited>
12/11/2024, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 21 from what I remember
12/11/2024, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And overall lifestyle can help but it’s mostly genetics
12/11/2024, 9:51 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 21-22
12/11/2024, 9:52 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah people who play high impact games tend to be taller... For example basket ball players
12/11/2024, 9:53 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): My elder one is 20 and is 5'6 and younger one is 16 and he is 5'10
12/11/2024, 9:54 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Younger one used to play football and now into fitness Sara din bodyweight  exercises chal rahi hoti hain
12/11/2024, 9:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s actually the other way. People who are taller play basketball.
12/11/2024, 9:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s your height and your husband?
12/11/2024, 9:55 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): He is 5'8 and I am 5'2 😩
12/11/2024, 10:27 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yes if u look at it that way😂
12/11/2024, 11:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So yeah. One son might have taken your genes. One might have taken after the husband (and because of his lifestyle he did even better)
12/11/2024, 11:09 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): What happened  to my genes at my time
12/11/2024, 11:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha
12/11/2024, 11:30 pm - PF - Sajida Ali: Bhaijaaan my post on Facebook is still on pending. Any update on itv
12/11/2024, 11:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Going home and getting to it, don’t worry
13/11/2024, 2:27 am - PF - Aman Ahmed: Hi so I was away for almost 3 days and took a break because of vacation. I didn’t track all my food calories and macros. Now that I’m back I checked my weight and I’ve gained one kg which could be either fat or either water cuz of the carb intake probably. I want to go back to my actual weight and I’ve restarted my diet again, but I need a suggestion that should I start with  my caloric deficit or I can also fast for one day and maybe that could get me back to my actual weight faster
13/11/2024, 2:29 am - Taha Ahmed: I don't like it as much as I used to! 🤭
13/11/2024, 2:31 am - Taha Ahmed: They're usually taller before they get into these sports, esp basketball
13/11/2024, 2:43 am - PF - Rehan Shah: <Media omitted>
How is this even possible 🫣🤭
13/11/2024, 2:43 am - PF - Rehan Shah: <Media omitted>
13/11/2024, 2:43 am - PF - Rehan Shah: <Media omitted>
13/11/2024, 2:47 am - Taha Ahmed: Hey @17245160153! Glad to hear you’re back and ready to jump in again. A quick weight bump after a vacation is super normal and usually just water weight from extra carbs and salty foods. And the numbers on the scale fluctuates a lot cause of that. So, no need to worry!

Instead of fasting or going into a strict diet mode (which is a pitfall many fall into), how about you just stick to your usual calorie goals, drink plenty of water, and keep up with fiber and protein? Your body will naturally settle back into balance, and you’ll see that number drop without any drastic changes. 

Enjoying breaks and getting back on track without stress is the real win! There's a room to make that mindset shift here.
13/11/2024, 2:51 am - Taha Ahmed: @16472930046 Haha! When you drop carbs and calories quickly, your body sheds water along with fat, which is why the scale can drop so fast at first. Carbs help store water in the body, so reducing them can lead to quick water weight loss.

Just a heads up: keep in mind that this rapid drop usually slows down as your body adjusts and balances out. Don’t freak out when that happens—it doesn’t mean you've hit a plateau.

Does it make sense? <This message was edited>
13/11/2024, 2:52 am - Taha Ahmed: @447719249818 it's done, check your FB.
13/11/2024, 2:54 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Does makes sense.. thanks
could you recommend any good multivitamins or minerals as for the past 2 weeks I am getting minor cramps on my feet and palms
13/11/2024, 2:55 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Yesterday I saw a vein pop on my palm 🤭
13/11/2024, 2:55 am - PF - Rehan Shah: It was tender to touch.. today its fine
13/11/2024, 2:55 am - Taha Ahmed: You're welcome! 🙏🏽

Also, I am not sure if that's because of any deficiency. Are you taking any fruits, like bananas, dates, etc.?
13/11/2024, 2:56 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Very rarely
13/11/2024, 2:56 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Both have high calories so 🫣
13/11/2024, 3:01 am - PF - Aman Ahmed: Thank you so much. I’ll stick to my usual calorie goals and keep following the regime  ☺️
13/11/2024, 3:02 am - Taha Ahmed: It’s possible the cramps and tenderness you’re experiencing could be linked to an electrolyte imbalance or even a Vitamin B12 deficiency. Muscles need potassium, magnesium, zinc, and calcium to function properly, and low levels can result from low food intake, dehydration, stomach issues, or intense physical activity.

Try incorporating potassium-rich foods like bananas, magnesium and zinc from leafy greens or nuts, and calcium from dairy. If you’d prefer, a zero-calorie electrolyte drink or ORS can help too. Multivitamins may help, though they don’t always target electrolytes directly-balancing these through diet or supplements is a good first step. <This message was edited>
13/11/2024, 3:02 am - Taha Ahmed: Do you have a GP on board who you could consult/show your palm?
13/11/2024, 3:04 am - Taha Ahmed: How about we do it for a week and reassess later?
13/11/2024, 3:04 am - PF - Aman Ahmed: Yes that absolutely works!
13/11/2024, 3:07 am - Taha Ahmed: Awesome! Let's do it.
13/11/2024, 3:41 am - PF - Rehan Shah: I will consult my gp as well, thanks

13/11/2024, 3:55 am - PF - Maham Rafi: @60193244266 I need your review
13/11/2024, 6:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m starting to get annoyed by this guy. 

It’s the most annoying and useless content out there. 

What your blood sugar spike is doesn’t matter what 98% of the population. The only place where this is going to make sense is if you have diabetes.
13/11/2024, 6:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Neither of those are high calories waisay. 

A Banana is usually 60-80 calories. A date is like 20.
13/11/2024, 6:34 am - PF - Rehan Shah: I have got Medjool dates, fitnesspal says its 66cals each
13/11/2024, 6:35 am - PF - Rehan Shah: But no worries I will start adding both of them to my protein shake 😋
13/11/2024, 6:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weigh it in grams and check.
13/11/2024, 6:37 am - PF - Rehan Shah: I will do that thanks 😊
13/11/2024, 6:39 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Btw how much should be good to help me with the deficiencies
13/11/2024, 7:03 am - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): <Media omitted>
Hey all these Ajwa dates have different calorie breakup , I’m calculating them at a 10 grams serving. Which one should I select
13/11/2024, 11:45 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
13/11/2024, 11:46 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I used this one last time
13/11/2024, 11:47 am - Taha Ahmed: First one seems good!
13/11/2024, 11:47 am - Taha Ahmed: Or this one^
13/11/2024, 11:52 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: First one looks decent
13/11/2024, 11:52 am - Taha Ahmed: It's actually very tough to measure exact food portions that would eliminate deficiencies. I'd say that instead of focusing solely on deficiencies, aim to nourish your body with a wide variety of whole foods. This means getting plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and whole grains. Each food brings a different set of nutrients, which all play a role a different role. Classic example is VitC and Iron. Eating foods containing these two together significantly improves iron absorption. So, don't stress about specific nutrients too much or specific amount of foods; just focus on a balanced, diverse diet, overall.
13/11/2024, 11:59 am - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): Thanks.
13/11/2024, 12:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: This guy is just copying that other gora content creator, trying to get views with these glucose spike reels. Honestly, there’s no real reason for him to be checking his glucose after meals unless he's running some genuine research or, apparently, trying to "reveal" some magical science that the evidence-based community hasn’t already covered.

It’s just another pointless content idea without any context—no explanation for why he’s doing it or what he hopes to accomplish with these videos. Bas, videos banaye jao, daraye jao, bakwas kiye jao. Lol.

Even his disclaimer says, “These are my personal readings and everyone’s readings are different. I’m not diabetic or pre-diabetic, and I hope to stay that way. I’m not a medical professional.” He knows his content isn’t meant to be taken seriously—he's practically saying, "Don’t listen to me!" 😂 HAHAHA!

Imagine if an orthopedic started posting videos on how to do cardiac surgery—you wouldn’t pay attention, right? Do yourself a favor and treat these glucose “experts” the same way. 😋
13/11/2024, 12:37 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
What is this exercise called and which muscles does it target? 🤔
13/11/2024, 12:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: T bar row. 

It’s for the back.
13/11/2024, 12:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Can it be done as an alternative for DB bent over row?
13/11/2024, 1:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
13/11/2024, 1:15 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 wanted to ask you guys, that there are no shoulder press movements in the 5 day split targeting front delts? Any particular reason?
13/11/2024, 1:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because front delts get a lot of work from your pressing movements and so most people have an imbalance (more front delt compared to lateral or rear delts)

And so a good program should always focus on side and rear delts to help mitigate that imbalance. 

And usmain bhi mostly lateral head because rear delt bhi to an extent upper back rows main involved hota hai.
13/11/2024, 1:30 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Got it, thanks Sameet, also @60193244266 i’ve been tracking my workouts and in the past week, i did 10 reps on incline db bench press, but this week instead of getting 11 reps and progressively overloading, i could only get 7 reps, does that count for losing muscle?
13/11/2024, 1:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Could be lack of rest/recovery, or sleep, or low energy intake or perhaps more fatigue buildup (because the muscle's not recovered), not necessarily cause of muscle loss
13/11/2024, 1:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not in one week. Could be lack of sleep or something like that. 

Rest times play a role too. 

Did performance on other movements get worse too?
13/11/2024, 1:41 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Only chest and biceps, back and triceps managed to increase a rep
13/11/2024, 1:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What week are you on
13/11/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Week 2
13/11/2024, 1:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hmmm. You might have gone heavier than you should have in week 1 then.
13/11/2024, 1:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But chalo just keep at it and try to rest 2-3 minutes between sets
13/11/2024, 1:47 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Okay
13/11/2024, 3:38 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I have heard that if you have pain in body you should take a rest from gym is it same if you have headache? Or it just for the training muscles
13/11/2024, 3:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: It depends on the kind of pains you're experiencing, how long you've had it for, where is it, why is it. Soooo many things at play here.
13/11/2024, 4:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, if I have a slight headache, I’ll usually go workout with lighter intensities and feel better after. 

But if I have a migraine, no chance.
13/11/2024, 4:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Do we go daily check ins? If yes . Then where

13/11/2024, 6:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: This question from taha
13/11/2024, 6:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: You were recommending flat shoes to try something like this ???
13/11/2024, 6:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
13/11/2024, 6:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: This is what I wear currently
13/11/2024, 6:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: For plantar fascitis what do think is better
13/11/2024, 6:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This will be better. Or even converse or vans are good cause they’re flat.
13/11/2024, 6:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: @923343773307
13/11/2024, 7:38 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So @923343773307 I tried Tai Chi and someone asked me are you doing MEGIC ?🥹😅😅
13/11/2024, 7:39 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So I just stopped doing it for now 🙃
13/11/2024, 7:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But why? Also where were you doing it?
13/11/2024, 7:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Just say yes, they will never ask again 😂
13/11/2024, 7:43 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: In my garden
13/11/2024, 8:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My heel is triggered . I did leg bum and tum class today. They made me jump on the stool thing . Doing lunges and stuff. I was able to do it. But now my heel hurts really bad.
13/11/2024, 8:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: The speed was hard to catch .
13/11/2024, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Might just need time to recover and get used to it.
13/11/2024, 8:30 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I'm travelling soon for 2 weeks. I need guidance on how to track calories during vacations. I'm sure I won't be able to eat decently 😛
Any tips ?
13/11/2024, 8:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t. 

Just estimate them if you want to. 

And aim to be at maintenance rather than stay in a deficit.
13/11/2024, 8:41 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Love this realistic approach 💜

Any snacking ideas.  Im full can’t eat anymore food.  But don’t mind snacking on something to help reach the goal
13/11/2024, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well, you’re very low on protein so maybe something with protein.
13/11/2024, 8:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Protein smoothie? 
Greek yogurt + Apple + Sweetener + Cinnamon?
13/11/2024, 8:56 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Small question….if i eat in a calorie deficit and not meet my protein goals will i still lose weight considering i am exercising?
13/11/2024, 9:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes but you run the risk of losing muscle instead of fat. 

Or not recovering from your workouts and increasing chance of muscle loss or getting injured.
13/11/2024, 9:01 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Ok
13/11/2024, 9:01 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Could that also be the reason i was unable to effectively workout after sometime?
13/11/2024, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Could be one of the reasons.
13/11/2024, 9:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You might have lost muscle and so performance wasn’t what you expected
13/11/2024, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But muscle comes back quick if you keep training and get your protein
13/11/2024, 9:06 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Understood
13/11/2024, 9:06 pm - PF - Anas Tariq Ameen: Thanks
13/11/2024, 9:09 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): Apple is all I have at this time 🙈
13/11/2024, 9:10 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): Any nuts or plain fruit that I can have to cover proteins without increasing the fat ?
13/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): <Media omitted>
Water chestnuts any good ??  I can live off these.
13/11/2024, 10:04 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: This message was deleted
13/11/2024, 10:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: I am ded!! 😅😂
13/11/2024, 10:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nuts are high in fat anyway. So nope! 
And fruits aren't considered a protein source.
13/11/2024, 10:08 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha): What about water chestnuts
13/11/2024, 10:09 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: @60193244266 @923343773307 
I just realised that many times I eat not because I'm hungry but just coz it's a habit, or it's time to eat for me or I can't stop myself when I see food,  or just because other people around me are doing it so I have to do it

Is it not a very bad habit 🤔
13/11/2024, 10:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I wouldn’t say it’s a bad habit. But it’s something that can, at times, disrupt weight loss. 

If because of that you’re going over your calories.
13/11/2024, 10:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also not a protein source
13/11/2024, 10:24 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I can relate to this
13/11/2024, 10:24 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I eat when i am bored 🫠
13/11/2024, 10:25 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Yeah me too
13/11/2024, 10:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I did not buy those trainers
13/11/2024, 10:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thinking about going to a podiatrist. It's going to cost me a fortune.
13/11/2024, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not a bad idea
13/11/2024, 11:27 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: just a random idea - could there maybe be a spreadsheet where everyone could just type in some recipes. diff tabs for snack, lunch, dinner etc. 
and it could be shared with us all. 
i mean i know I'd benefit from it. if others would want that too
13/11/2024, 11:58 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Sounds great
14/11/2024, 12:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://www.instagram.com/jalalsamfit?igsh=bmN2aDU0aDVyc3Br https://www.instagram.com/ice.karimcooks?igsh=MWowZ2YxOGpoZWdqMA==
14/11/2024, 12:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: This might help too
14/11/2024, 12:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://www.instagram.com/ice.karimcooks?igsh=MWowZ2YxOGpoZWdqMA==
14/11/2024, 12:24 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: these are amazing, thankyouuu!
14/11/2024, 2:54 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Are these good ? @60193244266 @923343773307
14/11/2024, 2:56 am - Taha Ahmed: They're fine to use, but keep in mind they have calories, just like any other oil.

These work well for sautéing veggies or steaming eggs (especially since eggs won’t stick to the pan), but for regular cooking, I'd pass.
14/11/2024, 2:57 am - Taha Ahmed: You can also use them for air frying and baking <This message was edited>
14/11/2024, 2:59 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Got it 👍🏽
14/11/2024, 3:00 am - Taha Ahmed: What are you planning to cook with it?
14/11/2024, 3:34 am - PF - Ali Hassan: For eggs and air fried stuff
14/11/2024, 4:03 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Is this accurate 🤔 the usual spoon seems less in quantity
14/11/2024, 10:14 am - PF - Dr Bushra: What do you guys suggest what's the best time for workout, before breakfast, empty stomach or we can do it whenever convenient.
14/11/2024, 10:39 am - PF - Umamah Abbasi: My ex dietitician asked me to workout on empty stomach so more calories are burned? Because at that time your body is using stored energy? But I wasn’t able to do it because of low energy.
14/11/2024, 11:20 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): There is no best time to workout. Whatever time suits your routine, its the best for you
14/11/2024, 11:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its hard to train with the same intensity when you workout in a fasted state or empty stomach than when you are in a fed state. So instead of buring more calories you will actually burn less
14/11/2024, 11:43 am - PF - Dr Bushra: I'm facing same problem, I'm too low on energy somedays
14/11/2024, 11:43 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I personally only ever do brisk walking in a fasted state sometimes because it is not too demanding. However, if I were to include stairmaster or any other intense cardio exercise, no way am I doing it fasted. Big no for (fasted state) strength training because I don't want my performance to suffer either. You have answered your own question in the end btw 😊 (low energy)
14/11/2024, 12:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When it comes to workouts, do what works best for you. 

Some people prefer morning workouts. Some don’t. 

Depends on what you’re used to as well. If you’re used to evening workouts, and start going in the morning, you’ll feel low energy but it’ll get better with time. 

But the calorie burn and all is the same and as Ali mentioned, if performance suffers then calorie burn might be less.
14/11/2024, 12:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes, this is an actual spoon measurement but once again grams are more accurate than using these spoons for tracking.
14/11/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Is it fine if i swap chicken breast for thigh? 
As it tastes better 
Or is the caloric difference too big
14/11/2024, 1:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fine. Minor difference.
14/11/2024, 1:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use chicken thigh when tracking
14/11/2024, 2:00 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): If minus the bone weight still go for thigh entry?
14/11/2024, 2:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Chicken thigh boneless
14/11/2024, 2:03 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And for leg?
14/11/2024, 2:03 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I am using chicken breast entry for leg too
14/11/2024, 2:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’d stick with thigh—same cut, almost the same fat content
14/11/2024, 2:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's also fine- chicken breast has less fat (why it's considered a lean meat), but you can make it work!
14/11/2024, 2:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Generally I use great for breast. 

Thigh for thigh, leg and wings. 

The only difference is slightly 1-2g per 100g less protein and slightly more fats.
14/11/2024, 2:14 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): So thigh entry are without bones?
14/11/2024, 2:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In trackers, generally all entries are without bones.
14/11/2024, 2:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Even if you search chicken wing, the calories are mentioned without bones
14/11/2024, 2:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I workout in a fasting state as well . If I eat I feel like sleeping. Plus I don't have time to eat in the morning I go straight to gym after school drop off. 
But today I had fibre cereal and a banana. And I will go to the gym and see if it makes any difference to my performance.
14/11/2024, 3:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I actually found some machines from the workout plan
14/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Checking on the day 1
14/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Instead of trap bar deadlift.  I'm doing 20kg kettle bell lift
14/11/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If that's ok
14/11/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 3:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Let me know if it's ok
14/11/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Or dumbells
14/11/2024, 3:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes it's fine
14/11/2024, 3:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: 10 kg each
14/11/2024, 3:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s great 👍🏼
14/11/2024, 4:05 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: That's really nice having some assistance. Thank you to all the coaches. This is something I can do. I think I was over training before
14/11/2024, 4:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Got three exercises left. I also found pecdec . It looks different than the video
14/11/2024, 4:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 4:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: That's pectoral machine
14/11/2024, 4:07 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Pectorial
14/11/2024, 4:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this works.
14/11/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also dumbbell bicep curls
14/11/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I lifted 4 kg each arm
14/11/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Over time
14/11/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: After a week shall I increase
14/11/2024, 4:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If 4 seems easy then yes
14/11/2024, 4:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My 11 12 rep was a struggle
14/11/2024, 4:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then stick with it for now
14/11/2024, 4:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): It isnt necessary to increase the weights every week. 
As long as 10-15reps with a weight are a struggle, stick to that weight. Once you build enough strength that you can do more then its a good idea to increase the weight
14/11/2024, 4:21 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Pec Dec I can't do more than 6 reps . I have never used this machine before. The weight is only 10 kg
14/11/2024, 4:21 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I ask too many questions . I will leave you guys alone for the rest of the day . . 🙈
14/11/2024, 4:23 pm - PF - Umamah Abbasi: Heyy! Completed my day 2 (leg day) yesterday Except for 1 excercise as I was left with no energy. I was exhausted. And I’m in pain. Is it okay to take rest today? I couldn’t even sleep yesterday properly after leg day
14/11/2024, 4:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. No harm in taking a rest day and focusing on recovery. 

Sleep and protein are your friends here.
14/11/2024, 4:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: We don't mind answering questions, but if there are a few questions at a time, it's better to ask them on FB for a proper response
14/11/2024, 4:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: One last exercise and last question. .
14/11/2024, 4:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: This for inverted rows ?
14/11/2024, 4:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes you can do inverted rows on TRX
14/11/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): I couldn't  do a single pushup  🤡
14/11/2024, 4:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can try incline pushups for now

Finishing now ... Rest coaches 😆
14/11/2024, 5:32 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
14/11/2024, 6:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Exactly! We nibble like this all the time and then "wonder" why we aren't losing weight, even though we're supposedly in a "calorie deficit." 🫠🫠
14/11/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 💯
14/11/2024, 6:19 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I had 400 calories remaining tomorrow so i ate that choco kunafa cake plan was to eat only 6-7 bites ended up eating half tub slowly slowly opened the fridge for one last bite for like 10 times💀
14/11/2024, 6:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahaha
14/11/2024, 6:21 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Mostly using it for oil
14/11/2024, 6:21 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I can relate to this last bite phenomenon 🤡
14/11/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: <Media omitted>
Is this a better option to order when getting a burger? 
Goal is fat loss so saving calories would be great
14/11/2024, 7:57 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Also how many calories would a double patty have
14/11/2024, 7:58 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Or should i just grt beef 😭
14/11/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is probably 400-450 <This message was edited>

14/11/2024, 8:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: A double beef patty is 850-900

14/11/2024, 8:06 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: So around 650 for double?
14/11/2024, 8:06 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Chicken will be better in terms of protein?
14/11/2024, 8:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 700ish, yeah
14/11/2024, 8:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably yes.
14/11/2024, 9:57 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: <Media omitted>

14/11/2024, 10:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Keep it the same till you can do 12/12 on most sets.
14/11/2024, 10:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Look so good
14/11/2024, 10:46 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Which city which restaurant?

14/11/2024, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’re overcooking it probably
14/11/2024, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m coming to Canada for this 😱

14/11/2024, 11:24 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Looks gud ?
14/11/2024, 11:24 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: This is 35 to 40% of my calories
14/11/2024, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What were the calories we gave you? Did you make a post on FB?
14/11/2024, 11:24 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: She said that, i hope she didn’t guessed it 🤭

14/11/2024, 11:25 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Just tagged u on the post
14/11/2024, 11:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'd just add 1tsp oil in the entries, just to be on the safe side
14/11/2024, 11:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha also if she weighed it after cooking then it’s likely higher in weight before cooking. 


If you eat this regularly (I would), just double check the measurements but otherwise a solid meal.
14/11/2024, 11:31 pm - You changed the group description

15/11/2024, 9:43 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Shh.. dont tell no one 🫣🤭everyone thought that this was the actual picture of my food, however i had exactly similar meal but couldn’t take a picture so shared this one instead and asked a question “is it a good and healthy food option” but i guess the food presentation caught everyone’s interest and then the communication started and I started having fun even though i really had in my mind of mentioning the truth at the end but got caught up with back to back meetings and later forgot about it until your 🕵️‍♀️ msg came… after looking at it I literally said oh sh*** why didn’t I mentioned that sooner 🤦🏽‍♂️ … i guess most of us follow Jalalsamfit he makes some awesome recipes and I always forward them to my wife (who is actually nothing less than a Michelin chef to me ❤️)
Msg got too long now and I would like to say to everyone please accept apologize I never intended to hurt/ upset anyone my joke/ fun went too far 🙏🏼

Take care
15/11/2024, 9:52 am - PF - Ali Hassan: The fomo detectives will let it slide this one time for now 👀 better not happen again 😂

15/11/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I am following 4 day gym plan completed the 3 workouts then according to my schedule 4th should be done on Wednesday and friday was 1st day of week 2 missed the Wednesday one so today should i follow week 2 day 1 or week 1 day 4?
15/11/2024, 12:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do day 4. 

You don’t have to follow the set days. You can move the workouts around too.
15/11/2024, 12:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: You should go with Week 1 Day 4 to keep the flow of your plan intact. And don’t stress too much about it. Life happens!
15/11/2024, 12:41 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Okay thanks. 
I used to skip the missed one🤡
15/11/2024, 3:37 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: <Media omitted>
Hey guys, how do i calculate the calories of this, since my mom prepared it.
15/11/2024, 3:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cooked rice 200g
Cooked lentils 100g
Potatoes 150g
Oil 3tsp
15/11/2024, 4:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also bro, please keep these questions to the tracking corner part of the community 🫡
15/11/2024, 5:18 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Plank instead dead bug alright?
15/11/2024, 5:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that works
15/11/2024, 5:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Salam 

If I workout 3 to 4 days Monday to Thursday 

And rest on weekends. Is this ok ? Or shall I squeeze home workout on Saturday or Sunday ?? 

The kids are at home and I'm really busy . I don't even get the step counts done those three days.
15/11/2024, 5:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And I also eat out on Saturday or Sunday with dessert too . V
15/11/2024, 5:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Wallaikum Assalam.

It's absolutely okay. Remember, you're doing it to make fitness a part of your lifestyle, not the other way around. If you don't get time to workout on the weekends, that's okay. You're still putting in 3-4 workouts in the week.
15/11/2024, 5:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Desserts are fine too! As long as you're staying in your caloric limit. :)
15/11/2024, 5:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: And even if you go over your limit one day, that's okay too!
15/11/2024, 5:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Think long-term!!

16/11/2024, 10:42 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Is it a gud approach to directly scan the label of what you're having and log the quantity? Or the calories might not be accurate? Sorry for this stupid question 🤡
16/11/2024, 10:47 am - Taha Ahmed: Not stupid, but I am confused. 😅
Scan the label? How?
Or scan the barcode and add that product's nutritional information in the app?
16/11/2024, 10:47 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah wat u said "barcode" 😂😂
16/11/2024, 10:48 am - Taha Ahmed: Oh, it’s the easiest way if the product info is already in the database—just scan the barcode, adjust your servings/portions (what you ate), and you’re good to go! <This message was edited>
16/11/2024, 10:49 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
16/11/2024, 10:49 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I find it really helpful so just wanted to confirm
16/11/2024, 10:50 am - Taha Ahmed: I personally love it!
Makes tracking so much easier haha.
I covered this in a video, will be posting it on FB on Monday.
16/11/2024, 10:51 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you 🙏🏽
16/11/2024, 10:51 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I even tracked jam e shiri with it 😂
16/11/2024, 10:52 am - Taha Ahmed: Hahahha! MFP has a lot of desi food products in their database.
16/11/2024, 10:53 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yes, i was scanning a russian chocolate bar macros first didn't catch it and mfp did in a blink
16/11/2024, 12:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just check that the calories in the packet and the app are the same. 

Many times it’s not.
16/11/2024, 1:48 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: How accurate are our local products' nutritional information on the packaging... I have doubts about that ??
16/11/2024, 2:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: Most packaged products by established, larger companies (Lu, peak freans, English biscuits, etc) are generally reliable, as they tend to follow standardized labeling practices. 

However, smaller food startups (nutrack etc) and local cafes (like we saw a calorie count from evergreen yesterday), and restaurants often lack the resources or regulations to ensure the accuracy of their nutritional information. They also probably don't really care. Lol! 

It's a huge issue in in Pakistan, as there isn’t strict oversight for nutritional labels, so the values might not always reflect the actual contents. 

So what do we do? Always take these numbers and values as rough estimates rather than precise figures. Or become better at tracking individual foods. Even then there'll be a margin of error, almost, always.
16/11/2024, 2:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: I generally have an issue with this, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't make much difference. I'd track the basics, see if there's any way I can improve, and move on.
16/11/2024, 2:11 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Thanks @923343773307 
Always on the point 🌹🥹

Just came across this and couldn’t agree more with the message! That's exactly what we are aiming to do at FoMo. We’re all about empowering everyone, especially women, to focus on strength, health, and confidence. We don’t believe in just telling you to focus on weight loss when what you really need is a more holistic approach. We’re here to educate and guide you on your journey.

If you resonate with this, drop a ❤️

If you think what we’re doing is a scam, leave a 👎🏽
16/11/2024, 5:58 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i read once on Pinterest that a woman should, at least once in her life, experience her peak strength. mental and physical to know what she's capable of. 
i dont rmr the exact words but that stuck.
16/11/2024, 7:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If I'm not doing any workouts at weekend. Do I still need to aim for the same amount of protein. ? I have an idea that protein is essential for recovery. But if I consumed more calories one day and I want to reduce the calories the next day. But if I do that protein goes down too.
16/11/2024, 7:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: Don’t cut those calories then! Protein needs to stay consistent, workout or not. Whether you're smashing a workout or binge-watching a series in bed, PROTEIN IS KEY for recovery, repair, growth, and even keeping you full (satiety). Prioritize it, always! 😊💪🏽
16/11/2024, 8:53 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: https://youtube.com/shorts/RS-nrbwkfUI?feature=shared
16/11/2024, 8:53 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Gud option ?
16/11/2024, 8:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes seems good
570ish calories with good amount protein

16/11/2024, 10:50 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: What are indications that you’re building muscle or have hit a plateau in your progress?
16/11/2024, 10:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Signs of muscle building:

Increase in strength
Clothes fit differently
Progress photos show changes (even if it's tiny and it takes time for muscle building changes to show up)
You're lifting heavier weights

Plateau signs:

Strength stalls
No visible changes
Workouts feel repetitive

But you need to give atleast 2-3 weeks before determining whether you've hit a plateau or not. <This message was edited>
16/11/2024, 10:54 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Week 2, performing better on some exercise but can’t seem to match the reps of my previous week
16/11/2024, 10:55 pm - Taha Ahmed: You're probably not recovering properly, or are lifting heavy weights, or could be both at play 

How's your sleep?
16/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Can’t really tell, i try to get 8 hours of sleep, routine a lil off though
16/11/2024, 10:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: If sleep's good, then I think it's either of those two things
16/11/2024, 10:59 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hmm, i’ll try to fill in my workout sheet for the past two weeks and then maybe you guys can have a better idea
17/11/2024, 12:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you going to failure on your sets or leaving something in the tank?
17/11/2024, 12:06 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Well, with every other muscle, i tend to go to failure till i can only do partials. But with certain exercises like squats and rdl’s leave some in the tank
17/11/2024, 12:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re going to failure then you won’t be able to progress week on week.
17/11/2024, 12:09 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Oh okay, so what should i do?
17/11/2024, 12:09 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Still continue training till failure
17/11/2024, 12:09 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Or focus on RP 7 then 8 and 9 week by week
17/11/2024, 12:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe just push this cycle as it is and then follow a more structured approach after the deload
17/11/2024, 12:15 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Okay, got it.
17/11/2024, 12:37 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266, just wanted to ask you this, like everywhere i’ve seen that we should always train till failure, if we want to build muslce, Why is that to progress we should leave a couple of reps in the tank? Like RP 7 in the 1st week and RP 8 in the second <This message was edited>
17/11/2024, 12:38 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: and so on. <This message was edited>
17/11/2024, 12:40 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If you are training actually to failure then 0-2RIR provides comparable muscle building stimulus so leaving a rep or two in the tank is fine
17/11/2024, 12:42 am - Taha Ahmed: Hey, jumping in here! So, training to failure isn’t always necessary for building muscle. According to current science, leaving 1-3 reps in the tank (RIR) can still stimulate muscle growth effectively.

Training to failure increases fatigue, which might hinder recovery or the quality of future sets and workouts, esp. if your nutrition, rest, or recovery isn’t on point. Instead, focus on progressive overload: gradually challenging your muscles with more weight, reps, or sets over time.

You don’t grow because you pushed to failure in one or two sessions; you grow when consistent stressors allow your body to adapt and increase stimulus over weeks or months.
17/11/2024, 12:43 am - Taha Ahmed: Save training to failure for specific sets or exercises (e.g., isolation moves) and focus on consistency, form, and intensity overall!
17/11/2024, 12:44 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Adequate Rest between sets also play a huge role in progressive overload muscle building & managing fatigue so focus on that too
17/11/2024, 12:45 am - Taha Ahmed: Yup, like 2-3 minutes rest, esp. if you're lifting heavier
17/11/2024, 12:47 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: So what i’m confused with is, I go all out on each of my exercise like till i can do only partials, that means i sometimes go above the 12th mark rep and do 14 or 15th rep and so how do i structure my workout? <This message was edited>
17/11/2024, 12:49 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Like for example with lateral raise, i try to spam them, so that means if i get to the 12 mark i continue spammimg them till i can do only partials. Is that right way or should i stop at the 12 rep and focus next time on doing 1 more rep?
17/11/2024, 12:51 am - Taha Ahmed: Let's have this conversation on FB!
17/11/2024, 12:52 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you should be training with a weight with which 12rep should be the hardest you cant do any more reps after that
17/11/2024, 12:52 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes !!!
I want to write essays in this😄
17/11/2024, 12:52 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Great, ill post this question on fb
17/11/2024, 12:53 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Not ready what all you’ve rambled on hahaha

17/11/2024, 1:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Getting to it
17/11/2024, 4:23 am - PF - Maham Rafi: Guys, a question for a psychology student
For those who have lost weight, can you please describe to me how your life is changed... and how has society's views changed for you?
Kind regards ✨️
17/11/2024, 4:35 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Wait a few months i will write a paragraph on this 🙏🏽😂
17/11/2024, 4:47 am - PF - Maham Rafi: Insha Allah ameen 🙏  I'm also waiting for myself to experience something new  😅
17/11/2024, 4:55 am - PF - Ali Hassan: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCcQJEYS47I/?igsh=MTU2M2Rzd3dsYnBodQ==

For a min i thought its taha 😂😂
17/11/2024, 1:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: I am not a psychology student but I can answer this quite well, I think!
17/11/2024, 2:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I can also answer it . Although, I haven't lost any significant amount. 

But I will be more fit and strong. My aches and pains will be gone. I will be confident in wearing whatever I want. I will be more happy and proud of my body. Will be more grateful for every function it's doing. 
Society unfortunately will have something else to say that will be negative. So , I will always be proud of my own triumph and enjoy my own journey throughout . . Regardless what society has to think about it. !
17/11/2024, 4:11 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: By psychology student, I mean that I need this myself for a project I'm working on...
17/11/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Yes please go on @923343773307 🌹
17/11/2024, 9:26 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
@923343773307 @60193244266 @923441183411 your 2 cents on this ? 🙏🏽
17/11/2024, 9:34 pm - PF - Amna Awais: In a week 150 mins of exercise to be done..
Is it true?
17/11/2024, 9:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: She’s not wrong.
17/11/2024, 9:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Minimum level recommended for good health
17/11/2024, 9:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Baat sae kr rhi hai
17/11/2024, 9:37 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Yes as per WHO 30 mins of physical activity per day for 5 days a week is recommended for good health
17/11/2024, 9:40 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: But it’s for 65 years and above . Below that 60 mins daily is recommended
17/11/2024, 9:40 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: <Media omitted>
17/11/2024, 9:40 pm - PF - Farwa Ali (Mrym): Ok my silly question  mughay simple bhasha main yeh bata dain k home workout  k kitnay reps kernay hai recommended in min aur max kitnay .....
17/11/2024, 10:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the workout. You don’t need to look at the time.
17/11/2024, 10:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re following the plans we made then it covers all of this
18/11/2024, 12:19 am - PF - Ali Hassan: A quick question... I don't eat the chicken in karahi or qorma but  I do love the gravy 🥲 how to track that ?
18/11/2024, 12:20 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I've been avoiding it for 1 week now because of the oil but now my patience is running out 😭
18/11/2024, 12:21 am - PF - Maham Rafi: Ohh that's an amazing question... I was also wondering 🤔
18/11/2024, 12:22 am - PF - Ali Hassan: And is it ok to have protein shake before a meal ? Or after is better? <This message was edited>
18/11/2024, 12:23 am - PF - Ali Hassan: It's really confusing for me... Most of the people just take the chicken out and eat it but i can't
18/11/2024, 12:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can have a protein shake anytime 
before or after doesnt matter
18/11/2024, 12:23 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Oky 👍🏽
18/11/2024, 12:24 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): gravy is primarily oil & tomatoes 
so if u r having gravy only then add oil & tomatoes
18/11/2024, 12:25 am - PF - Ali Hassan: That's the trick part
18/11/2024, 12:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just oil.
18/11/2024, 12:26 am - PF - Ali Hassan: So weigh the gravy and add that to mfp as oil right?
18/11/2024, 12:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll always be an estimate
18/11/2024, 12:26 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 🥲
18/11/2024, 12:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nah. Just estimate oil.
18/11/2024, 12:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because if you weigh it, it’s not pure oil.
18/11/2024, 12:26 am - PF - Maham Rafi: That's sad now 😞
18/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Ali Hassan: So if the whole thing is cooked in less oil for example 2 3 tbsp oil and the rest is just the masla (tomatoes, onions etc) wat then ? 🫠
18/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Maham Rafi: @447360154390 if you really craving it just eat it
18/11/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah that is why its confusing
18/11/2024, 12:28 am - PF - Maham Rafi: And share some with us 🥹
18/11/2024, 12:28 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I am scared to lose all my progress 🥲 this is the 1st time in my life i am measuring everything i eat so its a bit hard so at the end of the day I don't want to waste all this effort 😭
18/11/2024, 12:29 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Hahaha most welcome my mom makes delicious daigi qorma
18/11/2024, 1:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just share pictures and I’ll explain how to track. Ill guide you a couple of times and you’ll figure it out then.
18/11/2024, 1:03 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you 🙏🏽
18/11/2024, 5:58 am - Taha Ahmed: Have you seen the training plan video explaining how to use the sheet/training plans, etc.? If not then I'd suggest you go through it
18/11/2024, 6:01 am - Taha Ahmed: You won't lose progress! The only time that happens is when your tracking is way off, and instead of asking for help, you try to figure it out on your own.

But here, you’ve got three coaches ready to guide you. If you ask us, we help, and you implement what we suggest-0there’s no way you’ll lose any progress. 🙂

Trust us, and more than that, trust yourself! 🤝
18/11/2024, 6:04 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you for the reassurance 🙏🏽🙏🏽

True ?
18/11/2024, 7:07 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it is. And it's also got all essential amino acids.
18/11/2024, 7:08 am - Taha Ahmed: But eating too much can cause bloating
18/11/2024, 8:36 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Noted 👌🏽

18/11/2024, 7:57 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 12.5
18/11/2024, 7:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: There is no seated row . So I did this on a cable machine on the floor. By this weight . Is that ok ?
18/11/2024, 7:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if this weight was challenging enough for the given reps then its perfect
18/11/2024, 8:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was struggling with form . Was trying to keep my back straight but it was bending . I will try one weight up next week
18/11/2024, 8:04 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Before increasing the weight you must try to get better with form & angles of the exercise. Improve overall execution of the exercise
18/11/2024, 8:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I suck at pull ups and push ups
18/11/2024, 8:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Assisted pull up I cant do
18/11/2024, 8:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Did incline push ups instead
18/11/2024, 8:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): thats fine

19/11/2024, 6:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. So let’s get back to the same calories and protein targets. 

Has the doctor allowed you to start workouts?

The workouts are the same. We’re adding new ones this week. So you’ll have more options then.
19/11/2024, 6:35 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Yes he said start working out but in slow pace like first workout 3 days a week and then gradually increase the days and duration
19/11/2024, 6:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d recommend sticking with the 3 day workouts for now.

19/11/2024, 10:05 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: But aloo is less mostly daal
19/11/2024, 10:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Just measure the shami & whatever the weight of it is 80ish percent will be daal & baki aloo
make enteries to track calories accordingly
19/11/2024, 10:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use a cooked daal ki entry because woh cooked hogi.

19/11/2024, 10:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll use the oil when cooking it? So then just account for what you use.
19/11/2024, 10:47 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah just confirmed with my mom no oil used while cooking so it's gud... I thought maybe she used oil in the process
19/11/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I will just add 3 tbsp
19/11/2024, 10:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol

19/11/2024, 11:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you so much for the birthday wishes! It really means a lot to me. 🙏🏽🌻I  was having a bit of a slow day, setting intentions for the year ahead, doing some mindful journaling, enjoying good food, relaxing, and just chilling. It turned out to be a nice day, lol. And now, as a little treat, I’ve taken 2 melatonin so I can get a good night’s sleep! 😴 who else is prioritizing sleep today/this week? 😋

Oh, and it’s the big 3-0 today! 🥺 Time to naturally step into some new adulting responsibilities, I guess! Prioritizing sleep is one! Haha!

20/11/2024, 11:48 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Like in Italy, there is a common myth that I believed all my life that after 4 don't have carbohydrates 🫠
20/11/2024, 11:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 🤦🤦
20/11/2024, 11:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Unki tou diet hi carbs hai 😂

21/11/2024, 12:15 am - PF - Maham Rafi: And lasagne
21/11/2024, 12:16 am - PF - Maham Rafi: But jokes apart... Italians are really fit... they take care of themselves
21/11/2024, 12:17 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yup thats true
21/11/2024, 12:17 am - PF - Ali Hassan: And their skin 🤌🏽
21/11/2024, 12:17 am - PF - Maham Rafi: I lived there for 11 years, and they all say that unhealthy weight can't be normalised
21/11/2024, 12:18 am - PF - Maham Rafi: And fashion.. the made in Italy
21/11/2024, 12:19 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I've heard everyone in milan looks like a runway model
21/11/2024, 12:19 am - PF - Maham Rafi: No doubt
21/11/2024, 12:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s because they walk a lot and their portions are small AF
21/11/2024, 12:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: True
21/11/2024, 2:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 3:13 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Going to finish my last 3k steps 💪🏻
21/11/2024, 3:31 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I had a question.. lifestyle is quite busy so i try a max of 30 min treadmill and some weights at home.. slowly building up my stamina and making myself and health a priority.. in the meantime my lifestyle is such that even without this 30 min my daily steps are like 12k+.. would this count somewhat in calorie burning?Not trying to use this as an excuse to get away for my workout but just wanna know generally
21/11/2024, 3:37 am - Taha Ahmed: Do you mean to ask if 12k+ steps plus 30 mins cardio and some weights is putting you in a calorie deficit (calorie burning)?
21/11/2024, 3:37 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Yeh sort pf thats my question
21/11/2024, 3:43 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Basically these steps are regular daytime errands and work.. nothing like brisk walk or something
21/11/2024, 3:59 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Being active certainly helps but if you’re not focusing on nutrition then you can very likely not be in a deficit altogether. 

What being active does is that it allows you to eat more food and still lose weight compared to if you’re not as active.
21/11/2024, 4:44 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Thanks for the response Sameet.. nope nope tracking my daily intake for a week now.. getting a better hang of fitness app and trying to stay within the macros suggested
21/11/2024, 4:46 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: This was just something I wanted to verify that does this oart of daily steps also counts or not
21/11/2024, 4:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Definitely does. And it’s also great for health. 


Studies show people who walk more, live longer. And that’s a pretty cool thing ✌️
21/11/2024, 4:51 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Here’s to living a healthy longer life 🤩
21/11/2024, 1:42 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: I'm following the 3 day home workout. i do manage to complete the reps somehow but after doing squats and lunges my thighs get really stiff for days and i have trouble going up and down the stairs. would it be okay to do less reps? ._.
21/11/2024, 1:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, you will get stronger over time and the soreness will start to become less and less.
21/11/2024, 2:46 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Same 😅
21/11/2024, 2:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Lol. After reading all this, I'm motivating myself for a workout though 😂
21/11/2024, 3:26 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
21/11/2024, 3:26 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): <Media omitted>
When to take this? And 1 capsule or 2?
21/11/2024, 3:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 is fine to start with
21/11/2024, 3:40 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Should i take vitamin d supplement separately or only multi-vitamin is fine?
21/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I try to include fruits and vegetables in my diet as much as i can so do i  need a multivitamin?
21/11/2024, 3:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's NOT absolutely necessary, but since most of us don't consistently consume 3-4 servings of veggies and fruits daily (I sometimes don't so I rely on multivitamins), supplementing with multivitamins can be helpful. If you're already regular with fruits and veggies, you can easily skip the multivitamins.

Keep taking your regular vitamin D and fish oil tho!
21/11/2024, 3:49 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I try to but mostly i could take only 2-3 servings so if i take multivitamin should i take vitamin d too? Or the dosage in multivitamin is fine?
21/11/2024, 3:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not sure what the doses are like in each, make a post on FB and we'll discuss it there
21/11/2024, 4:32 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I made garlic shrimp and garlic rice yesterday and went a little overboard with my daily calories🙈 feeling the guilt today..
21/11/2024, 4:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yum. How many calories did you consume yesterday?
21/11/2024, 4:35 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: It’s supposed to be 1500 and from what I calculated it’s 1700
21/11/2024, 4:35 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I could be wrong maybe 1800
21/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Cz i went a little more than overboard
21/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: But yeh it was v yum
21/11/2024, 4:36 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: 😂
21/11/2024, 4:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's not a big deal. That just means you weren't in a deficit - just one day out of 7 (if we're talking about the week)

Let's put that into perspective, for example if you were to lose 0.7lbs in a week, now you'll lose 0.6lbs

Is that too bad? 😬

You got to enjoy good food and ate a bit more because you wanted to. 

Eating more one day doesn't mean that you lose your entire progress or that your calorie deficit won't anymore.
21/11/2024, 4:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s just 200-300 calories. 

Move on. Try to be closer to the target today. 

A strategy that works well for some people is being in a deficit Monday to Friday and then aiming for maintenance over the weekend. 

That’s pretty much what you did and there’s nothing wrong with that. 

It allows you to make progress whilst enjoying life. 

That to me, is a win win situation.
21/11/2024, 4:49 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Thanks Sameet & Taha.. Yeh this makes so much more sense
21/11/2024, 5:55 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: @923343773307 @60193244266 this is a success announcement...because our improved lifestyles are your success ....
 So somewhere in last days of October I noted my weight at 91.2 kg... I was in Islamabad then.
.today I just randomly checked my weight...and it was 87 kgs...my friend that it's 86 but I will keep it at 87!
21/11/2024, 5:57 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Thats great !!
You are doing an amazing job🔥
21/11/2024, 6:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s amazing.
21/11/2024, 6:00 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 👏🏽🎉
21/11/2024, 6:04 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Wonderful. Keep it up @923330277703
21/11/2024, 6:05 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Thanks a lot fellows and coaches....
21/11/2024, 6:05 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I guess this group is really core yo our bettered
21/11/2024, 6:06 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I am struggling with quite a few things..bur achieving this ...purely  fat loss, is such a morale boosting thing
21/11/2024, 6:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yay, that's amazing! 🙏🏽

We were just the guiding hand, you're the one who made the efforts. I'm sure you're proud of yourself! 💪🏽
21/11/2024, 6:09 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: For sure.... I am ..I ate as per my mood and my liking...just stayed fairly disciplined...
21/11/2024, 6:09 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I wasn't really great with followings but I tried my best...!
21/11/2024, 6:14 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Coaches @923343773307 @60193244266 @923441183411 ...I am struggling with my heels pain, whenever I get up from bed or chair my heels hurt,  I can't walk for a few seconds.  This never happened to me...my walk is not a comfortable one
21/11/2024, 6:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you seen a physio?
21/11/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: Not yet!
21/11/2024, 6:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That should be the first step
21/11/2024, 6:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes check with a physio first
21/11/2024, 6:21 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: I will have to make an effort for that but I will do so!
21/11/2024, 6:25 pm - PF - Ali Haider: I had a similar issue once. But that was due to high uric acid.. 

The coaches are right, you should consult a physio to be sure.
21/11/2024, 6:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because we don’t even know why the pain is there so can’t really say much. 

Could be posture related. Could be nerve related. Could be muscle tightness is another thousand things
21/11/2024, 6:32 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Or even 👟
21/11/2024, 6:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
21/11/2024, 6:59 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: For high uric acid,  Sameet mentioned that you should have some swelling around you ankle...but I don't have that
21/11/2024, 7:17 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I too have it. I'm still waiting for my referral. But an   ice pack helps when I walk a lot. To calm it down. But see a doctor or podiatrist
21/11/2024, 7:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm following the three day gym plan for workout. Just needed to ask. Does these exercises cover abs ? Do I need to do abs exercises separately?
21/11/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I feel my core is not very strong .
21/11/2024, 7:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. Depends on your goals. 

Your core will get stronger with these movements since core is a stabilizing muscle and used in many of these movements.
21/11/2024, 7:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: When I workout with group classes for full body conditioning. They do these abs exercises lifting their feet up. Where I can't lift my legs up for long time. They always do abs for last 5 to 10 minutes. Previously I was not adding any abs in my workout
21/11/2024, 7:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So three days planned workouts and one day group class I attend.
21/11/2024, 7:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If they’re doing abs then that’s good. You’ll get better with time.
21/11/2024, 9:09 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Leg raises ?
21/11/2024, 9:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: No
21/11/2024, 9:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Leg tuck ins or hollow holds I am assuming
21/11/2024, 9:11 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sitting twist while lifting the feets up
21/11/2024, 9:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And crunch kicks . I just find it hard to raise my legs up
21/11/2024, 9:14 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I did leg raises yesterday and some crunches, not a very big fan of crunches
21/11/2024, 9:18 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Russian twists i think?
21/11/2024, 9:19 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Do all these work the core? 
Like strengthen it? 
Or are the lifts enough?
21/11/2024, 9:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Crunches and leg raises or sit ups etc. target your abs but don’t fully engage the core, which includes muscles like the transverse abdominis, pelvic floor, erector spinae, hip stabilizers, etc. (I know those names are just too much, so think of it as your back, glutes, front abdomen).

Nowt think of it this way: a sit-up works one part (your abs), while a heavy squat recruits your entire core to stabilize and support (because it's a compound movement which involves multiple joints and multiple muscle groups to perform that movement). 

Compound lifts are far more effective for overall core strength! 😊 unless you want to build ab muscles, in which case you wouldn't say 'you want to build your core'.
21/11/2024, 9:56 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thanks for explaining the science . I do squats but worry about my form . So the answer is . Even if I don't do a separate abs routine. All the other exercises will help strengthen the core.
21/11/2024, 9:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
22/11/2024, 7:51 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
23/11/2024, 2:10 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @60193244266 BPI whey protein what flavor have you tried or would recommend?
23/11/2024, 2:11 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
Also is this the correct type?
23/11/2024, 2:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Haven’t tried BPI personally so far
23/11/2024, 2:29 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Is Dymatize also a good brand?
23/11/2024, 2:30 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I see that a lot
23/11/2024, 2:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Dymatize has probably the finest powder among all & tastes good too
23/11/2024, 10:14 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Can i have 1 scoop protein shake right after a meal ?
23/11/2024, 10:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah you could
24/11/2024, 12:53 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 asking for my mom because she’s diabetic, I recently saw a podcast with a glucose expert on it, i dont remember the name of the guy, so basically the expert said that if you have a table spoon of vinegar with water before eating anything it doesn’t cause a big spike in your glucose post meal, is this true? <This message was edited>
24/11/2024, 1:27 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: glucose goddess has a whole guide on this too ._.
24/11/2024, 1:45 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah 👍🏼
24/11/2024, 1:45 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: She’s an idiot waisay
24/11/2024, 1:46 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: i figured after i got fomo-ed 
she looked legit pehle :p
24/11/2024, 2:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol
24/11/2024, 3:03 am - Taha Ahmed: Glucose goddess is like a mermaid. Do we know it exists? Maybe 

Is it true? God knows cause it's subjective 

Whatever she says should be taken as a pinch of salt. It is highly biased and cherry picked
24/11/2024, 3:04 am - Taha Ahmed: Just like how we like our Karahi 😅
24/11/2024, 3:19 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Her podcasts are very fancy btw lol
24/11/2024, 4:27 am - Taha Ahmed: For sure.

But fancy ≠ scientific 😬

24/11/2024, 8:09 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey guys, had a question, regarding barbell rdl’s, my lower back gives in before my hamstrings do, so can’t really get to RP - 09/10 or near failure even
24/11/2024, 8:09 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Any solutions for that?
24/11/2024, 8:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Lower back will get better over time.
24/11/2024, 8:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the form too
24/11/2024, 8:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Keep the bar touching your legs all the time to avoid lower back loading as much as possible
24/11/2024, 8:20 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Okay, will try this next time
24/11/2024, 8:22 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Or initially try with dumbbells.. keep it as close to legs as possible.. that had helped me a lot
24/11/2024, 8:23 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Will, give both things a try
24/11/2024, 8:34 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Can I please ask a question
24/11/2024, 8:37 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: So why do people say that food can have a direct impact on our brain... for example, when we are stressed, we may overeat, or when I eat before lectures, I just sleep after that
24/11/2024, 8:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Stress can have an impact on eating behavior. But it’s different for everyone. Some people eat more when stressed. Some eat less.
24/11/2024, 10:42 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: It’s majorly because of these reasons 👇🏻

▶️ When we are stressed our body produces cortisol-a stress hormone and more insulin. So when we eat food high in sugar and fat contents , it provide a distraction from stress. That’s why we eat ice cream , cakes and chocolates more when we are stressed. 
▶️ Stress can affect the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls how much we eat. When stressed, the hypothalamus can increase the activity of neurons that signal hunger to the brain. 
▶️ Stress can cause people to regress and turn off their rational thinking and control mechanisms.So just to feel good we eat more. 
▶️ It’s because of gender too! Some research suggests a gender difference in stress-coping behavior, with women being more likely to turn to food and men to alcohol or smoking. And a Finnish study that included over 5,000 men and women showed that obesity was associated with stress-related eating in women but not in men.
24/11/2024, 10:44 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: So it’s a cycle- brain affect how we eat and what we eat affects our brain! E.g. too much sugar in kids makes them hyperactive
24/11/2024, 10:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Btw this sugar thing has recently been debunked to an extent 🤷
24/11/2024, 10:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And yes, there is definitely a link there. 

But not everyone responds the same way. 

Both me and wife stop eating when stressed. I just lose all my appetite regardless of what you put in front of me. 

Never had food before exams or anything either. 

So it’s very individual dependent and a lot of factors play a role here. 

Gender, psychology, physiology and even your upbringing and surroundings.
24/11/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Oh yes now I can see that! Thanks for the information @60193244266 . But whatever the research is mother would always believe that 😅 The only reason I can think of instead of a sugar rush is just maybe they are happy and that’s why active! 

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/sugar-rush-kids-nutrition-health
24/11/2024, 10:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i have a similar response when stressed i lose all my appetite & this also happens to me when i am sleep deprived
24/11/2024, 10:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, just energy in general.

If you eat anything, you now have more energy.
24/11/2024, 10:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): cortisol, leptin, ghrelin etc impact eating behaviours in different ways
24/11/2024, 10:54 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Thank you @923441183411 , I forgot about these leptin , ghrelin etc 🫢 I need to revisit my med school books 😅
24/11/2024, 10:56 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Also I don’t know if other people experience that too but I do have vivid dreams and nightmares when I eat a carbohydrate rich dinner
24/11/2024, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s the other way around for me. I sleep like a baby hahaha

Let me know if you have any questions! <This message was edited>
25/11/2024, 6:18 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Does protein shake make you constipated? 🤔
25/11/2024, 6:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Protein shakes themselves typically don't cause constipation, but it could be other ingredients that might be the culprit. Also, dehydration or not getting enough fiber in your diet can lead to constipation. Make sure you're drinking enough water and getting fiber-rich foods. If it persists, consider trying a different brand! 😊

It's not protein though, otherwise you'd get constipated every time you eat protein.
25/11/2024, 6:24 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I think I might be lacking some fiber then
25/11/2024, 6:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923441183411 is typing...
25/11/2024, 6:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes protein shakes dont generally cause constipation but low fiber in diet, lack of water intake & in some cases lactose intolerance can be a cause
25/11/2024, 6:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Whey protein may cause digestive problems for people with lactose intolerance by slowing the movement of the gut
25/11/2024, 6:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): haha at times my typing slows down when ami asks something inbetween😄
25/11/2024, 6:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Lactose intolerance typically causes diarrhea, but some people might experience constipation or bloating, though that's less common (almost rare).

@447360154390 Do you have the same issues with other dairy products like milk and cheese, or is it mainly with whey protein?
25/11/2024, 6:30 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Not really, been consuming diary products all my life, can these things develop later in life ?
25/11/2024, 6:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, that could be the case, but if you’re only having trouble with whey protein and not other dairy, it might be due to something else in that specific product or even a lack of fiber and water in your diet.

If you're fine with other dairy, it’s a good idea to check the ingredients in the whey protein to see if something else might be causing the issue.

I’ve had a peanut allergy since I was a kid, but it went away in my mid-twenties. On the flip side, I never had any issues with shellfish, but now if I eat crabs, lobsters, or shrimp, I get bad allergic reactions. So yes, it’s possible to develop allergies as you get older. Some things might go away, and others can pop up.
25/11/2024, 6:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Human beings are such complex and complicated creatures, haha! 💩
25/11/2024, 6:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): lactose intolerance can be developed later in life due to IBS, celiec disease, crohn's disease, bacterial overgrowth etc
25/11/2024, 7:54 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 💯
25/11/2024, 8:11 pm - PF - Mishaal Siddiqui left
25/11/2024, 9:19 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I need some advice from coaches.. I have been having major sleep disturbance lately.. I worked night shifts for few months earlier in the year.. since then I just cant have a deep sleep.. I have tried melatonin time to time.. magnesium glycenate.. desi totkas too.. but nothing’s really beneficial in long run.. 
discussed with doc and they just handed me a sleeping pill which is for bipolar disorder 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Is there anything you can suggest I do? Maybe something or a defeciency which could cause it?
25/11/2024, 9:42 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Hi @923343773307 

I please want to pause for at least 6 months if I can... as @60193244266 mentioned me when we started this community that for depression is better to go for therapy and now I started that... hopefully I'll get better and will come back to this community 🙏
25/11/2024, 9:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Some of my personally & clients tested things for better sleep:

Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time daily, even on weekends.

Expose yourself to natural sunlight early in the day to help reset your circadian rhythm. 

Avoid blue light from screens 2–3 hours before bed.

Try a calming activity before bed like reading 

Your body doesnt absorb magnessium properly if you have vitmain D deficiency.  so do check for that 

Include foods in your diet which contain tryotophan, vitamin B6 B12 (chicken, fish, beef, nuts, seeds, tofu, cheese, eggs, oats, beans, lentils, spinach, dates, bananas, and dark chocolate) to improve serotinin production
25/11/2024, 9:52 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Timings must be different for here
25/11/2024, 9:52 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Thanks.. I have been doing most.. but my shifts life doesn’t let me have a regular routine.. sigh.. thanks for your feedback

26/11/2024, 11:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: This because of the fat content. Calories are similar but macros for this look more relaistic. 

The other one probably has oil in it
26/11/2024, 12:20 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Is this OK?
26/11/2024, 12:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: @447438584129  We can pause for 1–2 months, but the system doesn’t allow for a longer break. You’re always welcome to rejoin later, though it would be at the current price and not the founder's rate you signed up with.

I genuinely wish you the very best and hope you get the help and support you deserve. Also, there’s no need to leave the community just because you’ve started therapy. Both can co-exist and work hand in hand. In fact, therapy and being part of this community can actually complement each other beautifully. <This message was edited>
26/11/2024, 12:31 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: Thanks @923343773307 

Then It'll better for me to unsubscribe then and rejoin later, coz there's no point of me staying here and doing nothing, hopefully I'll get better soon and will join again... I have depression from childhood and I'm only getting therapy now 🙃 that frustration doesn't allow me to do things the way I want <This message was edited>
26/11/2024, 12:33 pm - PF - Maham Rafi: I apologise for leaving right in the middle of the project, but there's no other way for me... I might surprise you with something later on... and best of luck to everyone else on their journey 🌹💐
26/11/2024, 12:50 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: i sincerely hope things work out for you and you find the peace you need 💕
26/11/2024, 12:57 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: You got this girl !! Go get therapy and kick depression ass. Trust me the rest will follow! I know depression is a very dark place to be and no one deserves to be there. Remember to switch to another therapist if things don’t work out with the current one. But also remember therapy takes time!! Let me know if you need any recommendations. You can ping me anytime if you want to talk about it! 
Lots of hugs and love for you ❤️ <This message was edited>
26/11/2024, 1:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you for sharing, @447438584129. Please!! There’s no need to apologize. Prioritizing your mental health and well-being is the most important thing, and I fully support you in doing what’s best for yourself right now.

We’ll miss having you in the community and responding to your posts, but I really hope this pause helps you focus on your healing journey. Therapy can be transformative, if it's not just CBT (talk therapy). Don't seek it because you need fixing (you're not broken!), Do it because these insights into yourself can help you improve. That's it from me. I truly hope it brings you the peace and clarity you deserve and are seeking rn.

Whenever you’re ready to rejoin, we’ll be here to welcome you back. And I’ll definitely be looking forward to that surprise! Wishing you strength, patience, and all the best. ❤ Take care.

P.s. If you ever need to ask anything, both Sameet and I are around. You can always drop us a message. 🙏🏽

26/11/2024, 8:02 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: It's still a long way to go but this time I am very hopeful that I will stick to this regime
26/11/2024, 8:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: One step at a time (or one spoon of biryani) 😁
26/11/2024, 9:09 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Love this !
26/11/2024, 9:10 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Haven’t been able to track anything (protein or calories) due to midterm weeek and lots of studying and work. 

But I’m eating my regular meals with addition of extra carbs. 

Hope it magically just works out together.

Walking 10k steps daily cause not going to the gym. <This message was edited>
26/11/2024, 9:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you were training before, consider this time as a rest and recovery period. Those extra carbs might be helpful here. And you might find that you feel even better and stronger when you return to regular exercise.
26/11/2024, 9:13 pm - PF - Amna Mir: My body feels weak after the hour long walk. Like legs cramping and back hurting (could be due to long hours of sitting for studying and exams)
26/11/2024, 9:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hmm. It could be postural or deconditioning (due to long hours of sitting). Muscle cramps and weakness can also happen due to stiffness, dehydration, or low electrolytes. We often forget to hydrate properly esp in cold weathers and the weather's changing these days, so try staying hydrated, stretching before and after your walk, and incorporating short posture breaks during study time. 5 min pause and stretch can help a lot!
26/11/2024, 9:30 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Is it ok if i eat more protein than the one recommended to me by that calculator? 
I sometimes have 160ish grams but i would not be full if i didnt 
I think i would just end up having more carbs
26/11/2024, 9:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's fine to eat more protein if it keeps you full, but excess protein won't provide additional benefits beyond satiety-your body will just use it for energy. If you're only eating more protein to stay full, consider having more carbs instead (fibrous carbs like vegetables). They’ll provide energy and balance your intake. But if you genuinely enjoy high-protein foods, go for it!
26/11/2024, 9:43 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: That makes sense yes 
I could definitely incorporate more fruits and vegetables
26/11/2024, 9:46 pm - PF - Amna Mir: Will be incorporating that. Thank you ✨
26/11/2024, 9:49 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: So it’s ok to have more veggie carbs even if ure done for ur target of the day?
26/11/2024, 9:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Vegetables don’t have that many calories so I’d say, yes.
26/11/2024, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Unless you’re having 4kg of carrots 😳😨
26/11/2024, 9:51 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Khargosh thori hun
26/11/2024, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahahahaha
26/11/2024, 9:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: HAHAHAHAH 🤣
Sorry this cracked me up bad
26/11/2024, 10:27 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Just one more thing 
Zyada protein se zyada muscle zyada jaldi nahi banega? 🤭
26/11/2024, 10:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No 
0.7-1g/lb or 1.6-2.2g/kg of your body weight should be your protein intake 
anything more than that is an overkill
26/11/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): When i will be on my goal and don’t want to lose fat or gain muscle in that case protein intake will still be this?
26/11/2024, 11:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes, if you will still be working out 
but if you are not working out, but you are active then you can lower it down to like 1.4/kg but incase you are totally sedentary even then keep it at atleast 1g per kg
26/11/2024, 11:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You ideally want to keep it within this range for optimal health. Maybe go down to 1.4 but anything lower, I don’t personally recommend.
27/11/2024, 2:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Apologies for the late announcement - I was waiting for the poll results! Based on your feedback, we’ve decided to have our live check-in video call at 9 PM tonight (Pakistan Standard Time).

If you can’t make it live, drop your important questions here in reply to this message, and we’ll cover them during the session!
27/11/2024, 2:38 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: What will be the duration for this call?
27/11/2024, 2:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Around 30–45 minutes, or however long it takes to cover everything and answer the key questions

The video will be available in the FB group later for everyone to watch <This message was edited>

28/11/2024, 12:40 am - Taha Ahmed: Before I go to bed, I need to say this.

I was just scrolling through some of the messages in the other WhatsApp group and in the FB group, and I couldn’t help but feel so proud and grateful for this community. Seeing you all step up to support each other while the coaches are busy is just amazing!

Please know that your efforts don’t go unnoticed - we see you, and we deeply appreciate you. Whether what you do is 100% spot-on or not, it’s the intention that truly counts. And that intention, the desire to help, is precious to me.

In a world where it often feels like no one gives a flying fck, you’re all proving that kindness and connection still mean something. You’re making a difference, and that’s incredible. 🙌🏽

That said, let’s leave the big stuff to the coaches, yeah? Jaja 😂 We wouldn’t want anyone to get hurt or overwhelmed.

Keep bringing the energy, supporting each other, and being the heart of this community. YOU ARE what makes Project FoMo special. Much love and appreciation to you all! ❤️🙏🏽 <This message was edited>
28/11/2024, 12:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: VID-20241128-WA0003.mp4 (file attached)
28/11/2024, 12:50 am - PF - Asma Tariq: This is hilarious. 😂
28/11/2024, 1:06 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: I have a very important question. How important are good shoes for exercise? I personally feel exercising in chappals is hazardous to your feet and overall health.
28/11/2024, 1:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why is it hazardous?
28/11/2024, 1:12 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Because chappals don’t provide the necessary support and grip to help you maintain stability during dynamic movements and that can lead to the risk of slips, falls, or twisted ankles <This message was edited>
28/11/2024, 1:13 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Also can cause blisters
28/11/2024, 1:14 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: You can hit your toes and get injured
28/11/2024, 1:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1. Why do you need stability in an upper body movement where you’re either sitting or lying down on a bench?

2. Dynamic movements are a different form of exercise. The gym doesn’t have dynamic movements. 

3. If I drop a 30kg weight on my foot, I doubt any show is protecting me 🤣
28/11/2024, 1:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For lower body work, slippers aren’t a good choice thought. You either go barefoot or any shoes that are flat.
28/11/2024, 1:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Btw fun fact: the shoes people usually wear in the gym, most slippers aren’t going to be a better option anyway. 

Even on lower body days lol
28/11/2024, 1:27 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Still why you would make your feet go through that?? And agar weight gira to definitely it won’t be safe in chappals but shoes me Phr bhy bachat ho jayay gy.
28/11/2024, 1:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: With a 30kg DB? No chance lol
28/11/2024, 1:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Go through what? I’m confused. I’m not walking on coals lol
28/11/2024, 1:35 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: No slippers are a better option! Gym should ban slippers
28/11/2024, 1:35 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: You can try?
28/11/2024, 1:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I have worked out in chappals for the like 90% of my training career & you can perform strength training movements/exercises in chappals without any issue 
if accidently lets suppose a 20kg plate or a 25 30kg dumbbell falls in your feet, a shoe wont save you either
28/11/2024, 1:36 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): A slight more protection maybe but it happened to me & shoe didnt save me
28/11/2024, 1:37 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Are you making the same logic as mout ayay gy to helmit bhy Nahy bacha sakta 😅
28/11/2024, 1:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is such a Pakistani thing btw. 

No gym in Dubai bans them. No gym in Malaysia either.
28/11/2024, 1:37 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: But It could have been worse? No?
28/11/2024, 1:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If a container falls on you, the helmet is going fuck all
28/11/2024, 1:38 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Is this evidence based logic?
28/11/2024, 1:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: What are we even talking about here anymore?
28/11/2024, 1:39 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Shoes Vs Chappals
28/11/2024, 1:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely
28/11/2024, 1:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
5 time Olympia winner right there
28/11/2024, 1:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No still got a fracture
28/11/2024, 1:40 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: He is wearing one. Is he exercising in them?
28/11/2024, 1:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, remember it’s personal preference. 

Fitness should be easy and accessible rather than making it more complicated and difficult for people.
28/11/2024, 1:40 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 6 actually😂
28/11/2024, 1:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: My bad lol
28/11/2024, 1:40 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Of course fracture to hoga gy . Maybe less tissue damage? Scarring etc
28/11/2024, 1:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
28/11/2024, 1:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There you go 🤣
28/11/2024, 1:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I have seen him working out in just socks too 😄
28/11/2024, 1:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: He’s in slippers in most of his content in the gym 

Which is why I love him. Such a no fuss mentality
28/11/2024, 1:42 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Uk un popular opinion- someone doing something is not evidence not atleast scientific.
28/11/2024, 1:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 100%
28/11/2024, 1:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923475239954 Shoes don’t offer much better support than slippers when it comes to training (running and jogging or athletics is different altogether).

For safety, yes, some gyms enforce that policy because they want to avoid injuries or liability. It’s more of a legal issue for them than a training concern. Mroeover, gyms usually require clean shoes to maintain HYGIENE standards and ensure safety.

There isn’t really a superior reason beyond that. There have even been instances where people got injured and sued gyms for compensation.
28/11/2024, 1:43 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Do we have any podiatrist here?
28/11/2024, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Let’s stop here and not drag this any further, if we want to talk about this in detail, we can take it to FB. Thanks!
28/11/2024, 1:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, no one is recommending you to wear chappals. It’s personal preference.

When it comes to actual evidence. 

There’s a lot of data on it now. 

Barefoot is probably best followed closely by flat shoes like covnverse. 

But that only applies to lower body work where you’re using your feet. 

If I’m sitting on a chair or on a bench, then I could not have legs to being with and it makes no difference
28/11/2024, 1:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oooo post please
28/11/2024, 1:45 pm - PF - Aminah Kamran: Just my personal experience 

I feel like my squats improved 
Form and everything when i stopped wearing shoes 

Like the grip was much better on the ground and stability also 
If that makes sense
28/11/2024, 1:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): please
28/11/2024, 1:47 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: This was a genuine question @923343773307 . No one is dragging this topic. We are having a healthy conversation here. Also, fitness doesn’t only means nutrition and exercise. It includes all these too.
28/11/2024, 1:48 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Also, do we have a guideline on what kind of questions we can ask here and what kind on FB?
28/11/2024, 1:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Aray that’s not what he means. 

We don’t use WhatsApp for such conversations. 

We use the facebook group for these things. Content there stays there and can benefit more people
28/11/2024, 1:49 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: This is what I am asking exactly 😅
28/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And we can share and tag actual research
28/11/2024, 1:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sure, by dragging, I meant within this group. We keep Facebook for detailed discussions and use WhatsApp for quick queries to avoid bombarding everyone with tons of notifications. It’s just for easy access to quick info!
28/11/2024, 1:57 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: I have developed heel pain in  my right heel since 2 3 days, the only thing I was doing different from the usual is running on treadmill 15 20 mins the past week
28/11/2024, 1:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be the type of shoes. 

Could also be that you might have to build up to 15-20 mins
28/11/2024, 2:02 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: I used to do 3km in 30 mins previously, my husband is also suggesting that the problem is with my shoes. They are almost 4 years old, i think it's time to get new ones
28/11/2024, 2:07 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Goodness me ..
28/11/2024, 2:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup, makes sense. 

What shoes are you currently using? Also, it could be that the foaming / padding has become damaged
28/11/2024, 2:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: In my gym most people do their deadlifts and squats barefoot. Trainers have sponge foams . 

I came to ask a question. I'm not in this debate
28/11/2024, 2:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Squat and deadlift while my heel on plate
28/11/2024, 2:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is that ok
28/11/2024, 2:09 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My heel pain( plantar fascia) triggered by long walks and prolonged standing.
28/11/2024, 2:13 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: Ive been using trainers from ndure.
Sent the picture lekin Internet issue in 🇵🇰🤦🏻‍♀️
28/11/2024, 2:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Squats on a heel can help ankle mobility and increase range of motion. 

But using them on deadlifts is pointless and actually makes the movement harder too (increase distance the bar has to travel)
28/11/2024, 2:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Where am I supposed to feel my deadlifts? Hamstrings glutes ? My knees hurt after squats and deadlifts
28/11/2024, 2:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So I can do squats while supporting my heel on plate 

Deadlifts are no good
28/11/2024, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the type of deadlift. But mostly glutes and hamstrings. 

Some lower back involved too
28/11/2024, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
28/11/2024, 2:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: jazakAllah
28/11/2024, 2:37 pm - PF - Ali Haider: You guys are debating whether to wear shoes or  chappals aur idr hmara gym owner shoes, chappal etc sb gym k bahr utrwa leta hai.. 😅

28/11/2024, 2:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Rocking the world. 😂
28/11/2024, 3:12 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307 and @60193244266 I’ve started taking creatine for improved recovery and performance. I wanted to ask you how much should my water intake be? <This message was edited>
28/11/2024, 3:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just normal water guidelines. 2-3liter per day
28/11/2024, 3:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s this myth that you need to increase water intake with creatine but that’s not a thing.
28/11/2024, 3:14 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Thank you for clearing that up, I too, believed this myth
28/11/2024, 3:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
The easiest way to know if you're well-hydrated is by checking the color of your pee. If it matches one of the top two shades, you're good, that’s what you should aim to maintain.

On some days, you can achieve that with as little as 1.5 liters (non-training, non-active days). On other days, you may need to drink more - 3 to 4 liters - especially on training or physically active days or if you're out in the sun.

So there's no one particular guideline for anything! :)

Hope it helps.
28/11/2024, 3:18 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: AOA 
I m new here 
I wanted to ask what would be the calories for me as my weight is 90.5kg 
Height 5’6
Age 23
28/11/2024, 3:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Can women take creatine ?
28/11/2024, 3:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hi @923208098888, please check your FB. I've tagged you on a post there.
28/11/2024, 3:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes! Absolutely no issue.

Trainers from ndure
28/11/2024, 3:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Might not be ideal for running or if they’re 4 years old, they might just have worn out
28/11/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Okk
28/11/2024, 3:54 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I did cable tricep extensions. I find it easier. Never done dumb bell tricep extensions. Is it same .? Or dumb bell one is more better. ? I find cable to be more controlled
28/11/2024, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both are fine.
28/11/2024, 10:41 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 and @923343773307 wanted to ask you does the seated cable row target more upper back or lats, cuz if it’s more lats then i could the single arm variation for it since it gives me a proper lat stretch but feel feel on the upper back and the double arm v grip hits more upper and less stretch on lats
28/11/2024, 10:54 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali (Allahrakha) left
28/11/2024, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Closer grip targets more lats. 

Wide grip is upper back
28/11/2024, 10:43 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: But the single arm variation is better or double?
28/11/2024, 10:44 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Cuz i did the single arm today gives a better lat stretch for me
28/11/2024, 10:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Uni-laterals will almost always give you a better stretch
29/11/2024, 1:38 am - PF - Iqra Munir (Saleh Jutt): Does this applies to everyone. I read on (google) that taking medications can cause the darker urine unless thinking its just dehydration. 

Expecting your views.
29/11/2024, 1:40 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Medicines and even multivitamins can have an impact at times
29/11/2024, 2:35 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yes when i take multivitamins its a bit darker than normal 🤔

29/11/2024, 4:41 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Forgot to add 1 tsp canola oil to cook tofu
29/11/2024, 6:41 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks decent. Are you sure about the ranch amount?
29/11/2024, 9:45 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Ok so the sauce 2 tbsp said 40 calories so i used the entry in app amd changed it so it counts calories to 40.. should I do it or not?
29/11/2024, 12:10 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: AsSalam u Alaikum 
Please coaches guide me about some food sources that helps in quick recovery of iron and Hb levels.

I had a miscarriage and I lost a lot of blood. My Hb went down from 13.2 to 9.2 

Jazak ALLAH
29/11/2024, 12:13 pm - PF - Dr Bushra: Have you tried ABC juice that's apple beetroot and carrot. My younger sister's HB went down to 8 when she had Viral Hep A, and it worked magically for her.

I hope it helps.

29/11/2024, 2:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'm so sorry to hear that @923363043867 

If you want some to do that naturally through foods, then apple, carrot, and beetroot juice (ABC juice) can be helpful since it contains iron and vitamin C. Vitamin C aids in iron absorption, so having them together is key. Other iron-rich foods include dates, figs, pomegranates, and spinach.

That said, it’s important to consult your doctor about an iron supplement for your situation. It can help replenish your iron and hemoglobin levels much faster.
29/11/2024, 2:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly, bringing iron levels up through food takes a long long time so supplements can really help here.
29/11/2024, 3:14 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: Jazak ALLAH

Which flavour could be good to order of whey protein isolate by Myprotein?
29/11/2024, 4:23 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: <Media omitted>
Previously I have used this one. I liked it so any flavour which tastes like this.
29/11/2024, 4:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’ve personally tried chocolate caramel (it was okay), chocolate smooth (a bit too powdery for me), salted caramel (really nice), and unflavored

I used unflavored the most because I liked making big smoothies and shakes and adding protein powder to them, and it didn’t change the smoothie’s taste (just my preference)
29/11/2024, 4:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sometimes I'd make hot chocolate and add protein powder in it too haha
29/11/2024, 4:30 pm - PF - Amna Junaid: I was about to order chocolate smooth or chocolate brownie… Thank God had a thought to ask here 😁
29/11/2024, 4:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: I mean you might like the taste of it. It just didn't sit well with me!
29/11/2024, 5:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cinnamon is good too
29/11/2024, 5:25 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Can we do different variations each week? Like if i perform some exciting with db previous week can i use barbell for same exercise or this should be stay same for whole plan?
29/11/2024, 5:26 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Pomegranate juice is really good too
29/11/2024, 5:27 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Many duas for you sis. May Allah grant you quick recovery
29/11/2024, 5:29 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: Aameen ♥️
Jazak ALLAH for your love 🤗
29/11/2024, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can keep changing but that just means progress will be slower and it’ll be hard to tell if you’re even progressing
29/11/2024, 5:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How do you know you’ve improved performance if you just keep switching movements?

29/11/2024, 11:03 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: Hi I am no expert but just something I was treated for. I experienced very low ferratin levels. If you are in Pakistan, doctors suggest iron via iv.. and that really helped bring up the levels. So best is talk to the doctor.
29/11/2024, 11:12 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: I got IV dosage of iron in the hospital and they prescribed iron supplements for recovery.
Jazak ALLAH for your suggestion 🙏🏻😇

30/11/2024, 12:11 am - PF - Maryam Furqan: I never experienced anything like this before ever and this health state is so depressing for me
30/11/2024, 12:17 am - PF - Hafsa Zubair: I just wanted to take a moment to send you my deepest condolences and heartfelt prayers during this incredibly difficult time. I know how devastating a miscarriage can be because I’ve been through it twice myself. It’s a loss that’s hard to put into words, and only Allah truly understands the depth of the pain we carry.

But one thing that kept me going was the reminder that Allah’s plans are always greater than what we can see. Sometimes the path He sets for us feels heavy and uncertain, but He is Al-Hakeem—the All-Wise—and every hardship comes with hidden blessings. Just try to take as much rest as you can and as taha mentioned incorporate abc juice , it helped me alot!

30/11/2024, 9:55 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: And if i can manage 5 reps in the last two sets with the weight reduced, then i increase it in my next session
30/11/2024, 9:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): This message was deleted
30/11/2024, 10:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 5 reps is the most you can do in the next sets ?
30/11/2024, 10:06 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Well, i stop at 5 reps, and if i do it easily and feel like have strength in me, in the next session I increase my weight for the last two sets till i can reach 5 in them
30/11/2024, 10:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Bro first tell me you just want to increase bench or doing powerlifting style workouts ?
30/11/2024, 10:30 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Because increasing strength with hypertrophy style workouts & powerlifting is different
30/11/2024, 11:08 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: I want to increase bench
30/11/2024, 11:59 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: ??
01/12/2024, 12:27 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey guys, so i have this query, from something i saw, it was that airfryers tend to produce a carcinogen which could be potentially harmful, is this true?
01/12/2024, 12:29 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro if you want to increase bench then keep it simple ae i explained you in the FB post before 
choose a weight with which you can perform 10-12 reps and keep it the same until u perform 15 or more reps with porper form with it, once u r able to perform 15+ then increase the weight. Thats what progressive overload is n thats how u will increase strength in any exercise
01/12/2024, 12:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any high heat cooking can cause that. It’s not specific to air fryers. 

Even bbq. And high heat frying.
01/12/2024, 12:32 am - PF - Jaish Dawani: Oh okay.

02/12/2024, 2:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Crunches mostly. Can also be a decline bench
02/12/2024, 2:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If I struggle with rdls 
Can I do leg curls instead ???
02/12/2024, 2:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My back is hurting with Romanian
02/12/2024, 2:51 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Someone told me it's the same as rdls but I think it's not going to work on glutes ?
02/12/2024, 2:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They both work the hamstrings but in different ranges.
02/12/2024, 2:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Leg curls don’t work the glutes though
02/12/2024, 2:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: And leg curls is more of an isolated hamstring exercise (you can make it work if you add in a glute exercise too)

03/12/2024, 8:23 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Should i train to failure in the 1st set and then have a RPE 6 in my second set
03/12/2024, 8:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, avoid training to failure. The goal is to reduce intensity to about 30-40% of your usual workload, allowing your body to recover. Instead of pushing hard, focus on lighter weights and an effort level of RPE 5-6 maybe. This helps maintain your movement patterns without overloading your muscles. Think of it as a recovery phase to prep for your next training cycle
03/12/2024, 8:29 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Okay, got it
03/12/2024, 8:34 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): After the deload week again start with 2 sets?
03/12/2024, 8:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Good question! So after the deload week, you return to your regular training intensity, but the goal is to gradually build back up to your previous levels. In Week 1 of the new cycle, you'll lift either the same weight as Week 4 (before the deload) or more, depending on how your body feels and whether you're able to progress. It's important to accumulate intensity and volume gradually to avoid fatigue and overtraining.

As for the number of sets, you don’t need to drop to just 2 sets. You can start with your regular set volume (3-4 sets) but adjust the load based on your current capacity. The idea is to progress slowly to avoid overloading your muscles too quickly. Just ensure you're not jumping back to the heaviest weights immediately. Use Week 1 to progressively build back up. This approach helps in maintaining consistency and avoiding burnout while still progressing over time.

Makes sense?

05/12/2024, 1:55 am - PF - Abdul Manan: I have a question regarding deload week. My workout split usually consists of four days: a push day, a pull day, a leg day and a day for shoulders and arms. Then i take a day off and then repeat this four-day workout split. My question is, should I deload for the four-day split or follow it for the whole week?
05/12/2024, 1:56 am - Taha Ahmed: So basically you're doing 6 workouts a week?
05/12/2024, 1:57 am - PF - Abdul Manan: Yes i am
05/12/2024, 1:58 am - Taha Ahmed: You should lower the intensity and do only 4 workouts in your deload week and at 30-40% of your usual workload!
05/12/2024, 1:59 am - PF - Abdul Manan: Okay so my regular 4 day split just at a lower intensity

Then back to normal routine after my day off
05/12/2024, 2:01 am - Taha Ahmed: Ideally yes. But depends if your body's recovering adequately or not.

I think that 6 workouts a week might be a bit much. Is your nutrition supporting this training style? And does your lifestyle (like sleep and stress management, rest and recovery, etc.) align with your training demands?
05/12/2024, 2:11 am - PF - Abdul Manan: Taha bhai, I’d say yes because I’m on a bulk, and I usually feel recovered by the second time I target the same muscle group in a week. I train fairly intensely with 2–3 reps in reserve at heavy weights. I often experience DOMS in most muscle groups, but by the time I target them again, the soreness is gone, and I can push myself to the same intensity.

However, I occasionally have to train only 4–5 days a week due to travel or work-related issues.


My workouts and nutrition are consistent as I track my calories and eat the same meals daily. Where I struggle is with sleep. For the past year, I’ve had trouble sleeping continuously. For example, I’ll sleep at 12 a.m. but wake up around 3:30 a.m. feeling fresh. I get sleepy around 9 a.m. but avoid sleeping then. I usually take an afternoon nap to compensate, resulting in about 6 hours of sleep per day.

I’ve tried 5 mg of melatonin, but its effectiveness is inconsistent.
05/12/2024, 2:27 am - Taha Ahmed: I'd personally suggest that you train 3-4 days, even if you're bulking. 
More workouts ≠ faster gains. 

Your body can only gain so much muscle mass in a week (unless you're on gear- then that's a whole different conversation) and and you can achieve those gains with just 2 solid workouts a week (5 or 6 workouts is an overkill, unless you enjoy working out, but then you structure your program in a way that's very low in load/volume/intensity). 

What truly matters is the quality of your workouts and REST AND RECOVERY. 
You don't grow/bulk because you're doing more at the gym, you grow when you're resting, specifically when you're sleeping.
If your sleep is all over the place, your body won’t grow. 🤷🏽‍♂ 
Focus on getting 7-8 hours of good sleep consistently first. Once that’s in check, then you can think about upping your workout intensity or frequency.
05/12/2024, 2:50 am - PF - Abdul Manan: I agree with you that rest is even more important than working out for hypertrophy. The issue is that I struggle with sleep, and I’m not sure why. Although I can function with my current, somewhat dysfunctional sleep routine, I know it’s not ideal.

I structured my workout routine after starting with a simple bro split. I watch a lot of Dr. Mike Israetel and Jeff Nippard’s videos, where they recommend training a muscle twice a week for optimal growth. Based on this advice, I designed my workout around it.

However, if you think working out six days a week is overkill, I can restructure it. I could still follow my usual four-day split, take a day off, and use the fifth day to target missed muscle groups like calves, traps, and abs. Alternatively, I could focus on mobility drills on that day and use the sixth and seventh days for active rest with low-intensity steady-state cardio, like walking
05/12/2024, 4:12 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That sounds better. 

Are you could follow a 5 day split too. That way you get more volumes in but still adequate recovery. 

How old are you though? Because age can be a factor too.
05/12/2024, 4:13 am - PF - Abdul Manan: I’m 24
5’10 and currently weighing at around 84 kgs
05/12/2024, 6:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that’s why recovery is good. So maybe move to 5 days instead of 6

05/12/2024, 2:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): deload is basically giving your body some after 4-6 weeks giving almost your all in the gym 
Deload helps with things like managing fatigue and prevents injuries 
Train 4-5 reps short of failure during your deload week & lower the weights you train with as well
05/12/2024, 2:22 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: So I don't need ro move ro 5 kgs...I feel I can easily
05/12/2024, 2:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): remember deload week isnt absolutely necessary if your protein intake, rest, recovery, sleep is on point
 if your are not feeling tired or fatigued & doing well in the gym
05/12/2024, 2:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup 🤌🤌

05/12/2024, 7:06 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hi @60193244266 @923343773307 and @923441183411 i had a couple of questions regarding deload week, so when you mean reduce the intensity of your workout by 50 - 60 % do you mean i reduce the weights and the rep ranges too, like for example if i do lat pull down at 27kg - 11 reps i should bring it down to 16kg 12 reps, right? <This message was edited>
05/12/2024, 7:07 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Can you in general just tell me how to structure a deload week, i follow the project fomo’s 5 day work split <This message was edited>
05/12/2024, 7:08 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Same I also don't have clarity about delaod.
05/12/2024, 7:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: After our discussions on deload this week, we realized that it'd be better if we recorded a video explaining this concept, which @923441183411 is working now that will cover almost everything about it. It’ll be posted in the FB group over the weekend - can you wait till then? <This message was edited>
05/12/2024, 7:14 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Yeah, no problem, already on a expiremental deload this week
05/12/2024, 7:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: Awesome, thanks!
05/12/2024, 7:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For now just reduce volume. So I like to do 2 sets of each movement instead of 3 and bring weight down so I’m closer to 3-4RIR
05/12/2024, 7:31 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: I have bicep tendonitis in this scenario how to deal with my workout?
05/12/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: According to the workout, i’m doing two sets, so should i reduce to 1?
05/12/2024, 7:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Total sets per muscle 4-6 kardo in a workout.
05/12/2024, 7:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also , please make a post about the muscle group that needs to be covered during a workout. And alternates of some exercise that require proper form
05/12/2024, 8:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: We'll do that soon as well!
05/12/2024, 8:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’ve been busy streamlining some of the onboarding and Admin processes so we can focus more on actual coaching and creating more educational content rather than getting stuck in admin tasks (which has been taking up a lot of my time lately).

One major update is that we’ve launched our Starter’s Guide! Please take a few minutes to read through it - I've posted it both in the Facebook group and on WhatsApp - here it's pinned in the announcements section of the community.

Thanks for your support and must let me know if you have any questions or feedback! 😊🙏🏽
05/12/2024, 9:19 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @60193244266 @923343773307 and @923441183411  like is taking a sauna after your worket or on your rest days improve your muscle growth or is it one of the factors in anything beneficial? My gym just got one and i wanted to ask
05/12/2024, 9:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it can improve muscle recovery which impacts hypertrophy but basic chezon py focus pehly krna hai protein, sleep, fatigue management
05/12/2024, 9:45 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Got it
05/12/2024, 9:47 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Hello fomo fam i am back 👋🏽 

So this whole thing was made in 2 tbsp oil, then divided into 2 portions one with just gravy and one with chicken and some gravy. I will be having the gravy only which is 170g in weight, so my question is should I track the 2 tbsp into my meal ? Or reduce it ?
05/12/2024, 9:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
After taking out the chicken and some amount of gravy
05/12/2024, 9:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
170g of this
05/12/2024, 9:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1.5tbsp oil for this
05/12/2024, 9:49 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Thanks
05/12/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Not any question .. 

Just a thought. I had Mr. Pretzel sugar and chocolate pretzels today.(330 calories)  I skipped my lunch. I felt really crappy after that. I used to eat nothing even for dinner after having a treat in the past like a punishment.. I tracked this time and moved on and came home and ate my steak and salad. My calories are still 200 left. You guys have seen me tracking and estimating too .... I'm just wondering me if I'm underestimating.
05/12/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But at the same time I'm thinking if doing this is the reason for not losing any weight . This indulgence
05/12/2024, 11:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Indulgence while in your calories will not impact weight loss
06/12/2024, 12:19 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Try some protein snacks, nowadays i am having myprotein wafers for my sweet cravings
06/12/2024, 12:38 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: is sugar rush a real thing?
06/12/2024, 12:52 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Recently been debunked.
06/12/2024, 1:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Then sugar crash is something ..because it makes me happy but after an hour I'm just down and lethargic ... You saying it's in my head
06/12/2024, 1:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Why my kids act so crazy after having lots of sweets
06/12/2024, 1:15 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: i relate to that. i usually didnt eat anything in the afternoons. but some days if i had a carb-loaded meal i'd face an energy crash too in the evenings. and then wake up feeling shitty 😅
06/12/2024, 3:54 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: They had calories. That’s what gives them energy.
06/12/2024, 3:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s because when you have a high calorie meal, you body shifts focus and blood supply to digestion. 

And therefore you feel lethargic because there’s less energy / blood circulation elsewhere. 

This is known as post prandial somnolence. 

People who eat biryani at work on Friday have the same impact. Biryani main sugar tou nahin so why the crash?
06/12/2024, 3:58 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Due to high in Calories.
06/12/2024, 12:48 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Biryani mein chawal it's high carbs
06/12/2024, 1:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chawal isn’t sugar. That’s the point.
06/12/2024, 1:21 pm - PF - Sahar Khan: You stay in RIR even after dropping the weights?
06/12/2024, 1:22 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes ofcourse 
its just that now you will have to do a few more reps to go till failure or close
06/12/2024, 2:59 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: @923343773307
06/12/2024, 3:03 pm - PF - Jaish Dawani: Hey @923343773307 and @923441183411 i wanted to ask how do you calculate your protien macros intake for the purposes of learning, like my intake according to our last discussion is 135 - 140 gms but i was reading that it be 0.8 to 1 per lbs of your body weight and my body weight is 188 lbs
06/12/2024, 3:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if your protein intake is 1.6g/kg of your body weight or 0.7g/lb then it will be enough for building muscle. 
Though you can keep it anywhere within 1.6-2.2g/kg or 0.7-1g/lb of your body weight range
06/12/2024, 3:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): avoid exercises which require biceps involvements ( pull movements like rows, pull-ups/downs, curls)
Check with a physio for rehab 
Modify your workout plan (lower body focus until you fully recover would be better)
You can train chest shoulders triceps as they dont require much biceps involvement but try not to push the body to limits or lift too heavy, dont train to failure
Eat around maintainance, increase protein intake, get proper rest for optimal recovery 
@923343773307 anything i have missed & you would like to add ? <This message was edited>
06/12/2024, 3:20 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Thanks a lot!
06/12/2024, 3:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We personally prefer 1.6g for most people. 

But you can go higher if you want. 

Depends on your goal. 
L
06/12/2024, 4:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: Great advice already shared here! Just to add, I'd recommend focusing on mobility and light stretching exercises to keep the shoulder and arm moving without aggravating the biceps tendon. Isometric holds (like a plank or wall push-ups) could also be an option if they don’t cause discomfort. And if you're doing lower body exercises like squats or lunges, avoid gripping weights too tightly to minimize indirect biceps strain. Recovery is the priority, so listen to your body and back off from anything that feels off. Physio guidance is key for long-term healing!
06/12/2024, 4:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, not evidence based advice but getting dry needling or cupping usually helped me with this.
06/12/2024, 9:15 pm - PF - Maryam Furqan: Sorry to intervene but yes as a physical therapist I have seen great results of dry cupping in my patients
06/12/2024, 9:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I have tried dry needling myself on the right triceps & it worked for me as well 
though i didnt have a tear

07/12/2024, 7:07 pm - PF - Muhammad Hassaan: Hi all, I’m glad to be in this space! I’m having a bit of trouble getting started with my health journey due to my hectic schedule—I work throughout the week. I do go to the gym five times a week for roughly one to two hours and try to eat relatively healthy, but I’m unable to track my food intake. My goal is to grow muscle and improve my fitness, but I’m unsure how to get the most out of my efforts. I’d really appreciate any tips or advice to help me move forward. Thanks in advance!
07/12/2024, 9:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What are you struggling with? Can you make a Facebook post going through it and I can give you feedback
07/12/2024, 9:11 pm - PF - Muhammad Hassaan: Sure, will do.
07/12/2024, 10:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: I'm sure this is something many of us here are navigating through as well, right?

So yeah, make a Facebook post and all of us will share some tips

08/12/2024, 7:10 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Hi guys. 
I’ve been calorie counting before, but I’m a little embarrassed to post my food logs on the Facebook group because of my eating habits. 

I struggle with anything sweet. I binge eat too sometimes. I’m working with a therapist for that too. But I think I need more accountability for my actions. And that food shouldn’t be my only source of sanity 🥲

Anyone else struggling with the same? Or any tips on how to overcome and manage it.
08/12/2024, 7:33 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: I can understand..i am struggling with the same issue..mostly while feeding my kids i eat like 2-3 bites of whatever they are eating..i m trying to control that🥲🥲
And also whenever i m sad or angry i skip my meal and then after sometime i eat anything that is unhealthy like chocolate nimko or whatever is infront of me..
How to avoid this habit?
08/12/2024, 7:55 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: I Hear you and you are not alone! I have a full-fledged snack corner in my office 😅 I just nibble on garbage because I am bored.  I have a very strong sweet tooth, so it's the hardest thing for me to not eat 12 Candi Biscuits and just eat three. It's an ongoing struggle. I have started to buy ticky packs instead of family packs and share the snacks with people in the office so I am left with less to eat. Alternatively, I eat dark chocolates instead of tofees. Sour jellies, and dried fruits like dried mango, banana, and sunflower seeds are great options. The less processed food, the lesser the addiction. I was just watching a BBC documentary on this!
08/12/2024, 7:58 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: And there is nothing embarrassing about the eating habits. we all are like this!
08/12/2024, 7:58 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Sometimes it isn’t because I’m hungry. It’s because of no reason at all.
And when I’m eating, I know I’m not hungry to have the whole bar of chocolate. And I’m feeling uncomfortable in finishing it. But the urgeee to just finish it all off before anyone else puts their hand on it. 
I feel like a child then 🙈
But I can’t help it at times.
08/12/2024, 8:00 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Yeah its mostly so my brother cant get his hands on my chocolate. Another thing I tried which works actually to buy expensive chocolate and trust me you won't have the heart to finish it in one go 😅
08/12/2024, 8:03 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: and above all, if your hormones are all over the place during PMS , Periods, postpartum, menopause, then we tend to eat all these sweet fatty foods.
08/12/2024, 8:04 pm - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): ~ marium try dry apricot and chocolate digestive biscuits
08/12/2024, 8:04 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: I’ve done that too. 
Expensive ho ya jo bhi, if I want it, I want it 💀

Sometimes I have a brownie ka bite and I’m good with it. But last week I had 3 full brownies, I felt like puking because i had it all in one sitting. But i just couldn’t stop myself. 

And then the guilt of erasing all the effort that you’ve put in just makes you more upset right. 
And I’m not starving myself before that too, just normal eating patterns. 
But going off just doesn’t make any sense.
08/12/2024, 8:04 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Can try those. Thanks!!
08/12/2024, 8:05 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Girls, this happens to all of us lol. No worries, just be mindful and importantly be kind to yourself. 😊
To have protein rich food/meal helps me to control my sweet cravings so far.
08/12/2024, 8:07 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Try those protein brownies! At least your protein intake will go high!
08/12/2024, 8:08 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: I absolutely love those chocolate digestive biscuits! great option!
08/12/2024, 8:14 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: Once in a while, we all do that. maybe you were upset about something or stressed. Be kind to yourself self, and if this persists as a continuous pattern, talk to your therapist. If you are taking any medication, maybe it's because of that. Like mine, erratic eating started after my anti-anxiety meds but it does subside after 1-2 years.
08/12/2024, 8:17 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I can relate 🫂
08/12/2024, 8:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: I want to start by saying there’s been some great advice shared here around choosing food alternatives, etc. But honestly, what truly matters is understanding why these patterns of eating happen in the first place. I'm going to share what I think about it and is not an advice of a therapist. 

You mentioned an example of finishing the chocolate because you don’t want others to have it before you - it's a thought process that can easily turn into a cycle of urgency and guilt around food (I've done that too, and I'd to work on it by constantly telling myself that I don't have to eat it all and that I can eat more tomorrow. The world's not going to end tonight). And trust me, this is something so many people experience, often without realizing how much their emotions, environment, and past dieting behaviors influence it.

Our eating habits are rarely just about the food itself. Stress, lack of sleep, and even our past relationships with food play a massive role too. (I tend to often skip meals when I am stressed, and sometimes I finish bars of chocolate and not eat anything else, and now I am fully aware).

And yes, chronic stress can push us toward sugary or high-calorie foods as a coping mechanism (because it acts as a comfort food - more safety in choosing that because it makes us feel safe - your therapist must be talking about this with you already), and poor sleep disrupts the hormones that regulate hunger and fullness, making it harder to stop at "just one" piece of brownie or piece of chocolate. If you’ve dieted or restricted certain foods before, it’s natural for your brain to perceive these as "scarce resources", which can create urgency around eating them (what you do when you've the urge to finish before everyone else) - almost like you’re in survival mode. This is entirely normal and nothing to feel ashamed of, but it'd be helpful to have some mitigating strategies around this to help you overcome this behavior. 

What matters is shifting how we approach these habits. What you can do is,

1. Be mindful of these patterns and journal them when it happens (so it's just not in the unconscious anymore and by doing so, you make it more real)
2. Remove judgement around the food... there's no food that is "good" or "bad." Seeing it through a neutral lens can reduce guilt and allow you to enjoy what you eat mindfully
3. When cravings hit, take a moment to check in with yourself quickly. Ask yourself if you are physically hungry, or are you seeking comfort or distraction? Either response is okay, but knowing which it is helps you make more intentional choices
4. Having more structured and balanced meals with protein, fiber, and healthy fats can reduce those uncontrollable cravings because you'll be full for longer

5th and the most important... create an allowance in your daily dietary intake where you include these foods almost everyday, which can change your relationship with food over time, esp if you start operating from a not-so-scarce mindset
08/12/2024, 8:28 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: That's so beautifully put, and I think it deserves a post in the FB group 🙌
08/12/2024, 8:30 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Really helpful. ❤️
08/12/2024, 9:33 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: A quick question! What’s the difference between simple protein powder and whey? What is preferred and why?
08/12/2024, 9:35 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: U mean whey isolate ?
08/12/2024, 9:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same thing. 

We have four kind of protein powders available now. 

1. Whey concentrate: This is your standard whey
2. ⁠Whey Isolate: more filtered to reduce a few calories and lactose content
3. ⁠Hydro Whey: Even more filtered with practically zero lactose
4. ⁠Vegan Whey: Comes from vegetable sources like peas, corn, soy or potato
08/12/2024, 10:07 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Any recommendations for protein powders that don’t taste like shit?
And are halal too. I recently got to know that not all protein powders are halal 😬
08/12/2024, 10:09 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I can personally vouch for Dymatize, MyProtein, Rule1, kevin Levrone, Syntha 6 they all taste good 
Its milk protein so they are halal but you can read the ingredients list before buying
08/12/2024, 10:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ali has suggested some good brands and their protein powders taste better.

Regarding protein powders being halal, it's tricky. It used to be a common practice to use 'rennet' during the curdling process to separate whey from the cheese on a commercial scale and rennet is basically derived from animal fats, usually pork. 

But for a while, food industries have been using synthetic rennet which doesn't involve any animal products in it which makes it safer for Muslims to consume whey protein. 

If you still have doubts, you can choose a plant-based/vegan protein powder blend, those are inherently halal! <This message was edited>
08/12/2024, 10:21 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: I was using Optimum Nutrition, but it isn’t certified halal as per their website. 
Its easy to achieve protein targets with protein shakes so I asked for recommendations.
08/12/2024, 10:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: https://theproteinfactory.pk/

They have certified halal products
08/12/2024, 10:45 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: <Media omitted>
Thoughts on this one?
08/12/2024, 10:46 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 50g protein 👀
08/12/2024, 10:47 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: also there are pre and post and also so many options for weight loss, fat burner. I am confused
08/12/2024, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Those are a waste of money. Pre workouts are just caffeine so you can use those but can also just have regular caffeine.
08/12/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: If I remember taha or sameet did cover the fat burner thing
08/12/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: In a video
08/12/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Yeah that sold it for me lol
08/12/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Also tastes the best imo
08/12/2024, 10:49 pm - PF - Bismah Nayyer: there is also a Casein Protein one!
08/12/2024, 11:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: The serving size for this would be pretty big too! Typically, a single serving of protein is around 25-30g with 19-25g of protein in it.

If they’re offering 50g per serving, the scoop size is obviously much bigger, and you’d probably get fewer servings per container.

Honestly, it feels like a marketing gimmick to me. You can stick to any regular whey protein, take 2-2.5 scoops, and hit 50g of protein if that’s your goal. No need to fall for the hype! 😄
08/12/2024, 11:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Both whey and casein are protein byproducts of milk!
Whey is fast-digesting, meaning it gets absorbed quickly by the body, making it ideal for post-workout recovery.
Casein is slow-digesting, taking around 8-12 hours to fully digest, which is why it’s often recommended before bedtime to support muscle repair overnight.
08/12/2024, 11:06 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Yeah you're right it's 25g which is still a couple grams more compared to others per scoop but i just love the taste of it and went w it
08/12/2024, 11:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
Only 14 servings per container? That’s wild! These guys are hyping up the “50g protein per serving” angle, but it’s all about marketing.

Meanwhile, MyProtein boasts about offering 100 servings per 2.5kg - it’s all the same whey protein at the end of the day. The difference is just how they sell it to make it sound more premium. Same product, different pitch! 🤷🏽‍♂
08/12/2024, 11:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you love the taste and find the brand good enough, go for it!
08/12/2024, 11:09 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: No you're right im gonna try different ones that are more economical
08/12/2024, 11:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Give MyProtein a try too!
08/12/2024, 11:12 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: Does isolate vs hydrolysate matter?
08/12/2024, 11:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: Only if you're lactose intolerant!
Like Sameet said above, isolate has some traces of lactose and hydrolysate is free of Lactose
So that's the only thing that matters!
Oh, both isolate and hydrolysate are considerably more expensive than whey concentrate, esp hydrolysate <This message was edited>
08/12/2024, 11:15 pm - PF - Ayad Z Muhammad: I am a little lactose intolerant. Which protein powder will get me max protein per serving then?
08/12/2024, 11:17 pm - Taha Ahmed: Get any isolate or hydrolysate tbh!
Myprotein has them too but so do so many other brands like ON, Dymatize, etc.
09/12/2024, 12:08 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Taha also recommended me  myprotein, so far its the best tasting for me
09/12/2024, 1:30 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): @60193244266 i saw a new protein shake on your stories reviews?
09/12/2024, 1:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: The Pakistan one? It was decent
09/12/2024, 1:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hasn’t launched yet I think

09/12/2024, 2:35 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923343773307 I love this ❤️

While I also used to suffer from the same problem, it has gotten so much better thanks to different things I too have implemented (as shared by other members and @923343773307).

But I want to second the fact that the 5th point is definitely a powerful game changer. Creating an allowance + operating from a not-so-scarce mindset.

Less reps with more weight
10/12/2024, 4:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If I'm doing 7 reps for leg extensions with more weight would it be better or shall I go down in weight and do 15 reps
10/12/2024, 4:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: The less reps I am doing it to failure
10/12/2024, 4:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And my quads just burn
10/12/2024, 4:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Recommended reps with adequate weight which is challenging enough to train in close proximity to failure
10/12/2024, 4:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Today I increased the last two weeks . That means I should remain at that weight
10/12/2024, 4:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): choose a weight which is challenging enough for 8-12 reps & then progressively overload over time
10/12/2024, 4:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Train in close proximity to failure. 0-3RIR

12/12/2024, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally you want to finish one exercise before moving mg to another. 

That’s how you strength train.
12/12/2024, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: With rest between sets.
12/12/2024, 10:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Circuit training or super sets can help save time when you’re short on time.

13/12/2024, 1:00 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Does meal timing matter? 

I have coffee at 7 am before going to gym (I workout from 8-9) I usually don’t feel like eating after so I end up sleeping (nap?) and have my breakfast at 11.30am ish. 

Is that fine or should I have protein or anything closer to after working out.
13/12/2024, 1:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Meal timings do not matter 
your overall daily caloric intake protein intake matters if you are hitting your goals then its perfectly fine 

Anabolic window post workout is a myth so if you feel like eating anything right after workout then its not a problem
13/12/2024, 3:36 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Just needed to know . Is your deload video uploaded by this weekend. If not. Can I have a few main points to follow through the deload week ..

I finished 4 weeks of workout this week. Next week will be deload
13/12/2024, 3:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I can see there are just 2 sets..is the weight going to go down too ??
13/12/2024, 3:37 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Because weight abhi Mein itna heavy use Kerti Hun bhi Nahi
13/12/2024, 3:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. Aim for about 70ish percent of failure weight.
13/12/2024, 3:38 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And I share the progress after finishig deload ?
13/12/2024, 3:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But if you’re not going to failure then you can extend the cycle by 2-3 weeks.
13/12/2024, 3:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Cause deload is only really needed after going close to failure and feeling fatigued.
13/12/2024, 3:39 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I started from 4 kg dumbbells and now I can lift 6kg. 

For deload i should lift 5 kg ??
13/12/2024, 3:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will make a post and ask my questions there. Will share the sheets too
13/12/2024, 3:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 4-5kg is okay

14/12/2024, 12:48 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: I have some questions
Which thing is more better running or brisk walk? 
Does age matter for running? Do we loose muscle due to running?? How many times we can do running? <This message was edited>
14/12/2024, 1:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re strength training and focusing on protein then you won’t lose muscle.

Age doesn’t matter. 

And everything else depends on context. Why are you asking about running? What’s the end goal?
14/12/2024, 1:46 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: I want to do sprint and I did. Due to sprint  I always experienced my legs more toned. My resting heart is also improved due to sprint
14/12/2024, 1:46 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: End goals is heart conditioning, burn calories and include different activity
14/12/2024, 2:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine. Calorie burn doesn’t matter, it’s the same if the distance is the same
14/12/2024, 2:16 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Thanks noted😊
14/12/2024, 11:53 am - PF - Nida Umer: When we talk about increasing step count 

- Is it just to increase NEAT or 
- does that need to be done like cardio - like a fast paced walk?
14/12/2024, 12:16 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Do females has to take creatine?
14/12/2024, 12:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): when you will increase NEAT your step count will increase automatically
14/12/2024, 12:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): like creatine helps alot its a really good supplement & females can take it
14/12/2024, 12:27 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Creatine increase bone density too?
14/12/2024, 12:28 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: If I don't want to pumped up my muscles then??
14/12/2024, 12:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): creatine isnt just about pumped muscles 
it improves cognitive functions, helps with better recovery, more energy etc.
14/12/2024, 12:35 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Okay thank you
14/12/2024, 1:39 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Yes i understand 
But what is a better way to increase step count?
Neat or cardio
14/12/2024, 1:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): NEAT would be better because it will be easier for your body to recover from it rather than doing proper cardio 
 though you can do a low intensity cardio  it wont be much taxing
14/12/2024, 1:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Either.
14/12/2024, 2:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Just shared a Mindful Eating resource on our Facebook group (linked below), go check it out!!

https://www.facebook.com/groups/projectfomo/permalink/564745442933738/
14/12/2024, 4:28 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Please help with the training plan

We can chose from the any 2 gym plans available( thrice n 4 times) 
Or we do one and complete it for 5 weeks and then start the other
14/12/2024, 4:32 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: You can do thrice in a week 
Pull/ push and legs 
Or  5 times per muscles
14/12/2024, 4:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: For example
There are 2 gym plans for three times a week
14/12/2024, 4:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Is there an order to follow
14/12/2024, 4:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Or is it just for variety
14/12/2024, 4:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can pick *ANY ONE PLAN* based on how many days a week you can train and what fits your schedule. There's no strict rule about following a 3-day or 5-day plan - it's all about your preference and consistency! The exercises in all plans are pretty similar, so the choice is yours!

For example, if you know you can commit to 3 days a week, then choose the 3-day plan. If you can do more, go for the 4-day plan. The key is to stay consistent, and the training plans are designed with enough intensity and volume over the week, no matter which plan you choose

Once you complete the 5-week cycle (including deload), the idea is to continue the same plan in the next cycle, but you’ll aim for progressive overload. That means you will start the new cycle from week 1, but this time you’ll lift heavier weights or increase intensity to keep challenging your body and making progress.

For example:
Week 1-5: You might start lifting 20kg weight for squats
Week 6 and beyond: You’ll start from week 1 again, but now aim to lift 20kg+2.5 or 20kg+5 to keep progressing

Hope that clears it up! No need to switch between the plans. Just stick to one and focus on gradual improvement! <This message was edited>
14/12/2024, 4:45 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you Taha.
This coming week is challenging but I want to begin somewhere, however the week after that will be winter holidays and i can do more .

I know its not ideal to move from 3 days to 5 days but what if i want to make that shift for the num of days i am off
14/12/2024, 4:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ideally, 3-4 days a week is more than enough (if you're following a structured plan like ours). If you want to move more, you can do other accessory work (train your weaker body parts or do more cardio for increased/improved cardiovascular health)
14/12/2024, 4:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Consistency over time is what truly matters, not the number of times you work out each week
Even if you only do one workout this week and three next week, that's still progress! 
Keep going at your own pace!
14/12/2024, 4:50 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I needed this push in life

14/12/2024, 10:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: If i am not asking for too much.
Can we have general guidelines on how to warm up before a work out. And any specific warm ups that we need to include.

I feel i am really bad with warm up n cool down and honestly i have no clue about it
14/12/2024, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Warm up: 5-10 mins on a treadmill to get your body temperature up. 

And then 1-2 warmup sets at a lighter weight for first 1-2 movements of the day
14/12/2024, 10:30 pm - PF - Nida Umer: What about dynamic n static stretches 
Do we need to incorporate those
14/12/2024, 10:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): any movement is basically a dynamic stretch so doing 1-2 warmup sets at a lighter weight for first 1-2 movements will be more than enough
14/12/2024, 10:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Static stretches arent necessary at all for the warmups
14/12/2024, 10:34 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Coool
Do they matter in cool down?

I usally rush home😂🙈
14/12/2024, 10:36 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): when u get done with a workout session   then body auto cools down gradually you dont need any specific thing to cool down
14/12/2024, 10:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m out of the gym exactly 5 seconds after my last set
14/12/2024, 10:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): same 💯
14/12/2024, 10:48 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Is it alright if i dont warm up?
14/12/2024, 10:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u should warmup 
prevents injuries improves athletic performance etc
14/12/2024, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can skip it but you’re at higher risk of injury so keep that in mind.

15/12/2024, 2:05 am - Taha Ahmed: I was catching up on today’s messages and couldn’t help but feel this overwhelming sense of awe for this community. The coaches here provide such practical, science-based advice, it’s honestly something I wish I had back when I was figuring things out. Back then, there were no forums like FoMo, and I had to rely on places like bodybuilding, t-nation, etc., which, while helpful at times, was often too generalized and not always rooted in solid science

I’m incredibly grateful for the coaches here who take the time to guide everyone so thoughtfully, and equally grateful for the amazing members who ask the right questions and share their journeys 🙏🏽 so thank you everyone! <This message was edited>
15/12/2024, 12:24 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And how many reps in warmup set and if i use 8 kg dumbell in my set so for warmup go for 7?
15/12/2024, 1:31 pm - PF - Ali Haider: You can try warm up sets with 50% and 60-70% of the working set weight (depends on availability of dumbbells).
E.g if you're using 8kg then for 1st warm up set 4kg and 5 or 6kg for 2nd warm up set.
15/12/2024, 1:32 pm - PF - Ali Haider: 8-10 reps should be enough, just avoid going to failure
15/12/2024, 1:42 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank YOU — to all you guys for building up such a community. One of you will always answer almost immediately which is amazing. 

I wont lie, I didnt have much hopes when i joined (obv coz of past experiences) but this is amazing.

But yes, its on the person himself how much he wants to learn. The onus is on you alone. The more you take part the more u learn. (Which can get overwhelming sometimes for a person like me- i am always questioning my self if i am asking too much) 

But even then I am in awe and I just started. I hope i stay on track. And iA if I do the credit goes you u all.

17/12/2024, 6:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: Myprotein would totally endorse that, tbh. They’re all about sales and pushing as many products as possible. Got a need? They’ve got a product for it. I’m pretty sure they already sell MCT oil and all that stuff too
17/12/2024, 6:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: I had to quit because I lost millions during Covid and the lockdown. Here, people only use these supplements when they're working out - protein powders especially are so tied to gyms and workouts. If someone’s not exercising, they don’t even think about whether their protein intake is low, which isn’t how it should be

And honestly, I didn’t like pushing those products just for the sake of it, so the best way for me to get out of that situation was to shut it down and take the loss
17/12/2024, 6:44 pm - PF - Ali Haider: Covid was indeed a very tough period for businesses.
Glad you found a way out that worked for you..!

17/12/2024, 7:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: What made u think otherwise
17/12/2024, 7:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Difference of opinion because I started educating myself and didn’t agree with their approach.

I need suggestions for a good protein powder, especially taste wise and some bars too with low calories. My brother is coming from the states. So I shall source. 
Any suggestions.
18/12/2024, 2:05 am - PF - Rehan Shah: We usually get Optimum Nutritions Vanilla flavour 5lb bag from Costco.. it goes well with everything may it be smoothies, baking, shakes etc
18/12/2024, 2:08 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Most probably... These aren't homemade
18/12/2024, 2:09 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Pakistan se mngwaye thy
18/12/2024, 2:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nothing comes close to Legion and Outwork in terms of quality of ingredients
18/12/2024, 2:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Other than that, MyProtein, Optimum Nutrition, Rule1, MuscleTech are all high quality brands
18/12/2024, 2:18 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Thanks! ✨ @60193244266

18/12/2024, 8:20 am - PF - Nida Umer: This message was deleted
18/12/2024, 8:38 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): around 350-400 calories per 100g as they are deep fried
18/12/2024, 8:46 am - PF - Ali Hassan: How to track them in mfp ?
18/12/2024, 8:47 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): search for desi phulki i guess available hoga option
18/12/2024, 8:47 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i dont use MFP myself
18/12/2024, 8:48 am - PF - Nida Umer: Then?
18/12/2024, 8:50 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: There are dahi bara options
18/12/2024, 8:50 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: And dahi phulki
18/12/2024, 8:50 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i use fatsecret or macrosfirst
18/12/2024, 8:51 am - PF - Nida Umer: Any particular preference?
18/12/2024, 8:53 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): On macrosfirst you will find Desi Phulki on macrosfirst its calories are somehow okay but macros written against that option are flawed 
On fatsecret you find dahi phulki option
18/12/2024, 8:53 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): fatsecret for me but i use macrosfirst from time to time too
18/12/2024, 9:09 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I use mfp because it has more desi food options just my opinion
18/12/2024, 9:12 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes !!
but somehow i trust fatsecret & macrosfirst. Fatsecret abit more because Layne Norton's Carbon app also uses fatsecret's directory

18/12/2024, 10:59 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Optimum Nutrition. Dymatize. I'm currently using cookies and cream from Dymatize and I really like the floor. I have it with cold milk. Really fine powder easily mixes.
18/12/2024, 12:14 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Do we have to rest after warmup set?
18/12/2024, 12:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 
not as much as after a proper working set but upto a minute would be fine

18/12/2024, 1:38 pm - PF - Ali Haider: How's the taste. Is it better than myProtein?

Haven’t been able to source it.
18/12/2024, 3:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Salam 
It was my deload week. But I got busy after coming back home from hospital. Alhumdulillah my son is fine and back to nursery now and I managed to workout yesterday .
18/12/2024, 3:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Can you please tell me briefly what the deload for and what I am aiming for . ?
18/12/2024, 3:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Am I going to get stricter from next week. Reducing more calories and increasing the workout intensity ?
18/12/2024, 3:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: Wallaikum Assalam, so glad to hear that your son is doing better now. Alhamdulillah!
18/12/2024, 3:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Alhumdulillah... Also my pcos is triggered with stress. I haven't got my periods on day 46. I'm not expecting. I did the test. And I'm really scared to go on scales as it just goes up when I'm irregular.
18/12/2024, 3:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: I can share the more about it here, but I think our video, recorded by @923441183411, will explain everything in much more detail. It’s scheduled to be posted in the group at 5 PM today. If you can wait until then, that’d be great!
18/12/2024, 3:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Oh great . Until then just share a few points. One lines . I might go to the gym again later on . Kids breaking off for winter holidays here on Friday.
18/12/2024, 3:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, you're not going stricter at all! No reduction in calories either, and if you feel fully recovered then you can increase the intensity by either increasing the load (weights) or by increasing a few reps per set
18/12/2024, 3:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So if I'm not mistaken deload is like rest week ? Like rest days
18/12/2024, 3:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Numbers on the scale will fluctuate all the time and it's just data/feedback for us. It means nothing really other than giving insights into what is happening. If the scale's gone up, that means the water retention is high due to hormonal irregularities. Nothing else!
18/12/2024, 3:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's not technically a complete rest week, and it depends! There are different scenarios where a deload can be helpful and applicable:

Intensity Deload
Volume Deload
Hybrid Deload
Full Deload (complete rest)

Our video goes into detail about each of these!
18/12/2024, 3:39 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Will look forward to it
18/12/2024, 3:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yesterday I added more exercises but less reps.
18/12/2024, 3:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But I wasn't sure if I'm doing right .
18/12/2024, 3:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: Until the video is up, you can search for the keyword *"deload"* in this group chat. There are already several responses here, including answers to some of your earlier questions about deloading!
18/12/2024, 3:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: JazakAllah
18/12/2024, 3:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: You mean extra exercises other than the exercises in the training plan?
18/12/2024, 3:49 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes
18/12/2024, 3:50 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Including the training ones
18/12/2024, 3:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: May I ask why you added more exercises? Like what was your thought process?
18/12/2024, 3:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Missed around 5 days
18/12/2024, 3:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Of working our
18/12/2024, 3:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Out
18/12/2024, 3:54 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So I thought I would include just a few leg exercises
18/12/2024, 3:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: A full-body workout is a good idea if you missed a few sessions last week, but the key is getting back into the habit, not overcompensating for the missed workouts. Doing more won’t have as big an impact as consistency over time. It’s about mindset - rather than focusing on making up for lost time, focus on building a sustainable routine moving forward
18/12/2024, 5:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: The training programs are full body workouts or split in to different muscle.group in each session. ?
18/12/2024, 5:17 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I might do home workouts during winter holidays .
18/12/2024, 5:27 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
18/12/2024, 5:28 pm - PF - Nida Umer: There are no squats here
I enjoy doing barbell squats
Can i substitute them for leg press
18/12/2024, 5:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Here’s the video on deloading! Check out the link: https://fb.watch/wyulXssS3D/
18/12/2024, 5:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: I think it’s a great opportunity for you to share what you think those training plans are for, and of course, we’ll let you know if you’re on the right track or not <This message was edited>
18/12/2024, 5:31 pm - PF - Nida Umer: The 4 day plan is an upper lower split
18/12/2024, 5:32 pm - PF - Nida Umer: 2 upper 2 lower
18/12/2024, 5:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: They're both different movements. Squats require a hip hinge and knee bend. Leg presses follow a more linear path and doesn't necessarily mimic the same movement as a squat.

So if you like doing the Squats, you can add 2-3 sets of BB squats in your plan in addition to what you're doing. :)
18/12/2024, 5:36 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Makes sense
18/12/2024, 5:36 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Thank you
18/12/2024, 7:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also substitute BB Squats for Leg presses. The leg press there is the big movement for quads. 

So you can do that with Squats too. 

If you’re add them on top of the current workouts then do BB squats first, followed by leg presses. 

That way you have the most energy when doing squats.
18/12/2024, 8:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Noted
Thank you
19/12/2024, 5:34 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): I am very confused about this i was telling my cousin that i am in deficit and all and i eat this much calories then he told me what he  asked me calories of whatever he eats and counted his approx daily calories turned out according to our calculations he ate 1600 only in breakfast and daily having 3 to 4 thousand cals than adding his stats i check his maintenance calories from the calculator according to calculator his maintenance were 1900 so why he doesn’t gain weight?
19/12/2024, 5:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: 1. He probably has very high activity levels 
2. Exaggerated his intake calories
3. He eats really high calories one or two days and then eats very few the following days
4. Etc... <This message was edited>
19/12/2024, 5:38 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): No he isn’t that active. 
His breakfast is same daily 2 parathas with lot of oil ofcourse and egg with lot of cals then tea with sugar.
19/12/2024, 5:42 pm - PF - Ali Haider: They could be only eating this much in front of you. Not daily.
There is no way a person can eat 3000 (if maintenance is 1900) and not gain weight.
19/12/2024, 5:43 pm - PF - Ali Haider: This makes sense. 
I had a friend who used to walk 15km daily, he used to eat a lot while maintaining his weight.
19/12/2024, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s his weight?
19/12/2024, 5:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And his age?
19/12/2024, 5:54 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 60
19/12/2024, 5:54 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): 23
19/12/2024, 5:55 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Height 5^7
19/12/2024, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah he’s definitely not eating 3000. 

He’s exaggerating his food intake. 

Like I used to think. I eat so much. I started accurately tracking it was 2300-2400.
19/12/2024, 6:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is where estimations can be off and it’s important to track calories on a food weighing scale. 

Especially if you haven’t done before.
19/12/2024, 6:04 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Mere sath to ulta hai
I think i eat so less aur track karo to itna ziada nikalta hai😂🙈
19/12/2024, 6:05 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Even if he is exaggerating still wouldn’t it be more than 2000 bt having parathas and dinner also includes lot of oil he eats like proper dipping in the salan oil😂 and then midnight dine outs so why isn’t he gaining weight😭
19/12/2024, 6:08 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Depends on overall weekly calories and weekly activity levels as well
19/12/2024, 6:22 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: He is also very lucky

21/12/2024, 11:30 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Whole milk isnt unhealthy. Just manage your overall intake thats it 
apni daily caloric intake k andr rehty huay protein intake target hit horaha hai to issue koe nhi agar fat intake thori zada bhi hai
21/12/2024, 11:32 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yess whole milk is good 🤤🤤

And chemicals aren’t bad. A banana is also made up of chemicals and so is water.
22/12/2024, 12:39 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: That’s true as well …. Is almond milk is healthy ??? It’s less calories
22/12/2024, 12:41 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Aap ny healthy or unhealthy ko filhal side py krdena hai 
Koe food in itself healthy ya unhealthy nhi hota the quantity u r using a food in makes the difference.

22/12/2024, 2:38 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: I’ll do mine but I will also do inches 
Everyday weight check is good or bad 😬
22/12/2024, 2:45 am - PF - Rabia Hannan (Naina Rabia): @60193244266 kya different weight scale different results show karty Hain?
22/12/2024, 3:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. You can’t compare results of 2 different scales.
22/12/2024, 3:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And try to take weight data 3-4 times a week if you want to keep a track of weights. Otherwise check after 4 weeks or so. 

On the same scale and before you eat anything in the morning.
22/12/2024, 3:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Everyday weight doesn’t matter. You need to look at the weekly average.

22/12/2024, 4:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey everyone! 👋🏽 Happy Sunday! 

I just posted a check-in thread on our Facebook group, and I want to encourage everyone who sees this message to go and do your check-in right now. This is the second-last check-in of the year, so it's a great opportunity to reflect on how far you’ve come and realign your focus for the goals ahead. The more you share with us, the better we can understand your situation and provide guidance and support.

Why are these check-ins important?
1. It keep you accountable. Regular check-ins help you stay on track and recognize your wins, no matter how small
2. It provides clarity. It’s a chance to reflect on what’s working and what’s not, giving you the insights needed to make meaningful adjustments
3. It motivates you and others. Seeing progress and sharing it with the group can reignite your determination and inspire others as well
4. It gives you flexibility when planning ahead. Esp. with the new year just around the corner, this check-in will help you identify key areas to prioritize in the months ahead (and will help us help you better!)

I know the last two weeks of December are the busiest for most people, that's why I want you to take a moment now to assess your journey. It's great feedback and very valuable, not just today but for the months to come. And as a reminder, please remember, this is your space to grow, and every bit of effort you put into these check-ins contributes to your health and fitness success, as well as a member of our FoMo Community.

So take out 5 minutes, jump in and check in now! 💪🏽

P.S. I'm personally waiting for you all to check-in, even if it just says "I am feeling great" or "I fucked up!"

26/12/2024, 12:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey everyone, quick feedback questions for you all:

1. How has the FoMo Community challenged your preconceived beliefs, ideas, and understanding of nutrition and fitness since you joined us?
2. What do you think you'd be doing right now if we hadn’t launched FoMo?

Be honest, be creative! Your responses might just end up in our FoMo 2024 recap. 😄
26/12/2024, 12:32 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I would be munching on my fav foods without realising about the portion size and their calories 🤡
26/12/2024, 12:33 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: For example i always thought popcorn was a low calorie snack and I could eat loads of them 😄
26/12/2024, 12:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Btw if you get these then popcorn are pretty low calorie. 

The packet ones. Not so much.
26/12/2024, 12:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I always make it at home 👀
26/12/2024, 12:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Sometimes i put butter and salt and sometimes just salt

But to make yogurt we need 1 to 2 tbsp normal dahi
Wo full fat ho 2 tbsp dahi

Tu us se jo yogurt banegi wo full fat hogi ya low fat?🤪🙈
26/12/2024, 1:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Low-fat, of course!  
Since the primary ingredient for the yogurt would be low-fat milk. 😊
26/12/2024, 1:26 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: 1. i can now eat fruit whenever i want. 
2. i do *not* have to skip roti or rice
3. protein is important as heck
4. i can still feel full even if I'm eating less, but eating mindfully 
5. cinnamon water is *not* going to make me slimmer 😅
6. 20gm paapri has 150 calories??? 😭
7. cornetto kills my icecream cravings at just 170 calories 🥳
8. feeding my body well, and mindfully regulates my energies and moods better. 
9. i can resist junk food because it doesn't serve my body well and wont align with my goals rn. 
10. it's okay to leave your plate unfinished and go back to it later 
11. do not listen to most nutritionists around you. 
12. chicken doesn't cause pcos. 
13. any kind of movement is important
14. doesn't matter how old you are, better food and movement = a better life. 
15. it *needs* to be sustainable for it to work. 
16. i don't have to eat cardboard tasting bran breads 🥳

these are some of the changes I've had in my brain in these past 6 weeks at FOMO. and they're life changing for me atleast. 



if it weren't for fomo, I'd be in and out of gyms, binge eating when stressed, waking up feeling crappy with no direction, no sustainable systems and listening to whatever people around me were saying and just trying that out. <This message was edited>
26/12/2024, 3:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Appreciate this so much! ❤ Thank you Sakina!

What about the others? 👀🙊
26/12/2024, 3:33 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): She said most of what i wanted to say
26/12/2024, 3:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: That’s called stealing, okay? 😋 Haha!

I know you can share your experience in your own words, even if it overlaps a bit with what she said above. 🤷🏽‍♂ your experience is unique and that's what I want to hear about <This message was edited>
26/12/2024, 4:34 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Before FoMo, I attempted tracking but found it daunting to record every detail and cook all my meals myself. I'd start strong, but eventually give up. I had no idea that estimating portions was an option.

Joining FoMo has been a turning point. I've learned that occasional slips are okay and that a long-term approach is more important than perfection. I've discovered that I don't need to feel guilty about dine-outs; instead, I can be mindful and estimate my tracking.

FoMo also fixed many misconceptions about workouts and nutrition for instance i used to think fatloss is related to workout like to lose belly fat i have to train abs. And i can have anything i want by managing even if its deep-fried
What matters is the weekly calories

This mindset shift has simplified tracking for me. Previously, my progress was stagnant because I wouldn't track my dine-outs, which would put me at maintenance level. Now, I'm more consistent and aware of my habits, making progress towards my goals. <This message was edited>
26/12/2024, 7:05 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This message was deleted
26/12/2024, 7:10 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Before Fomo, I was scared—scared that I would never be able to stick to a calorie deficit because I thought I’d have to eat lots of veggies and meat while giving up my favorite foods. It’s still a long journey, but I have more confidence in myself now. I believe I can do this, change my eating habits, and eventually transform my life.
26/12/2024, 7:11 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Just another thought that came to my mind
26/12/2024, 7:34 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,

1. Before FoMo, I used to believe that fitness simply stands for rigorous exercising and calories elimination Like complete boycott of Roti and chawal 😬. It has really made my eyelashes pop, re-opened my eyes to a more balanced way of thinking. Everything I ever wanted in life is summed up in one word, 'fitness", They can beyond workouts and processes and programs- a change of mind, a change of habit, and a change in food. This community has helped me to make more sustainable decisions rather than ephemeral fashionable ones. 🌸

2. Honestly, I would most likely have continued to make things far more complicated for myself than they needed to be in terms of exercising, or I would not have exercised at all. Having FoMo, has helped me create a supportive environment for myself to keep me going, I might have lost motivation or focus by now.  💫

Thanks for educating us "Mindfulness about food". ✨

😊
26/12/2024, 8:21 pm - PF - Faraz Nafees: The most important thing I learned from this program is to be responsible. At the start of the program, I thought I was eating in a deficit. I tended to ignore those extra calories, thinking that since I ate well all day, a small amount of junk wouldn't make a difference. In reality, it made all the difference.

I'm now also eating responsibly on weekends. I've realized that it's more important to watch my diet on rest days. During my first weekend after joining Project FOMO, I learned that calculating calories is the way to go. Previously, I would starve all day and have a huge meal on weekend nights, thinking it was still below my maintenance calories. But oh boy i was so wrong!
26/12/2024, 11:33 pm - PF - Nida Umer: When I was thinking of joining in Dec one of my friends said whats the use when u have so many events coming up. 

But i was right in making this decision to join. I am yet to see results but this wedding/holiday season, being a part of this group made me more mindful of what i was eating. There were more good days than bad. 

The best outcome from being here is that i havent had extreme guilt trips after eating whatever I ate. 

I still need to work on my deficit but i am sure i am better equipped now. Also being a part of community helps alot when u are having bad days.

Another positive was that I rejoined the gym. Something that i have taken a break from since a very long time. <This message was edited>
27/12/2024, 9:55 am - PF - Farah Salman: I can't really write a paragraph because it's been 3 days since I've joined this community
But one thing that im loving about it is
KISI BHI KHANAY KI CHEEZ KO YAHA MANA NAI KIA JATA 
Literally
Jalebi ho ya chips
Chocolate ho ya icecream 
Bahar dinner ho ya ghar
Na kisi ko judge kia jara hai.
Na mana karrae hain.
But  usk calories estimation mai help ki jati hai
Love it
27/12/2024, 11:48 am - PF - Nida Umer: Coaches
Can you please help me with some lower back strengthening exercises.

I have had a disc tear earlier which wasnt paining any more. But i think i got excited at the gym and triggered my pain again. 

Any help in this regard would be useful.
27/12/2024, 11:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Things like hypertension, reverse hypertension, deadlifts can all help build strength in the lower back overtime
27/12/2024, 11:50 am - PF - Nida Umer: I think i f*** it with deadlift🙈
27/12/2024, 11:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Might have been a form thing
27/12/2024, 11:54 am - PF - Nida Umer: Hmm
I hope i can get past this pain iA
27/12/2024, 12:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s likely a spasm / pulled muscle.
27/12/2024, 1:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: You’re all making me feel so many emotions right now haha, and while I can’t fully put it into words (cause it's too early in the morning 👀), I just want you to know this: you’re absolute legends. You’ve chosen to trust us, follow our advice, and stick around through it all, and that means the world to us.

Right now, the internet is full of noise and fleeting trends (idk if you saw Sameet's video yesterday about AirFryer? can you imagine people talking nonsense on the TV? I mean sure, it's not shocking anymore, but STILL? kaun deraha hai inhein platform?) 

This^ is why it's easy to feel like the work we do could get lost in the chaos. But you’ve shown us that what we’re building here - together - truly matters. It’s your belief in this community and the change we aim to create that keeps us going.

I genuinely appreciate all the feedback you’ve shared and the kindness you’ve shown. Ending the year on such a positive note with the FoMo community is something we’re immensely proud of, but we know there’s still so much more to do, hundreds of people to help...

So we’d love for you to help us grow this space so we can reach and support even more people. If you could share our posts on Instagram, tag us, and help spread the word, it would mean so much. Your voice could inspire someone out there who needs exactly what we offer here. I am sure there are plenty people who don't even know FoMo Community exists... help us change that, please?... Maybe? 🙊 Haha

Anyway, thank you again for being here - not just as members, but as part of something much bigger. 🥂🍩🍕 (<<< this is me bribing your with donuts and pizza) <This message was edited>

27/12/2024, 2:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sorry for being late on feedback. 

I was very close to going on a carnivore or keto diet to see results. YouTube and tiktok are full of Information but no authenticity. I realized even eating less can be detrimental and not good for my body. I was eating less than 1200 calories and going to the gym without hitting my protein and was extremely exhausted. They taught me how to eat properly. I added carbs and realized this gives me energy  Finding it .. I started to enjoy food and shifted my mindset. My weight is still plateau but I have had so many other gains since I joined. Especially with working out. 

I really want to be consistent but I am a very busy mum of 3 young kids.   My habits of eating healthy and taking care of myself having a lasting effect on my kids is the biggest gain. 

I really hope with coming year I will achieve all my goals and keep on learning with FOMO .. inshallah 

On last note, 
I have been really inconsistent this month. Did few workouts at home and haven't been gym. Also indulged in festive foods . Not guilty this time But looking forward to getting back on track after the holidays are over.
27/12/2024, 6:17 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: - I’ve learnt to make smart choices about food. Have realized that with being just a tad bit organized I can still enjoy everything.
- I’ve felt by tracking I feel more in control. 
- Have seen the results with strength training in a short period vs tiring myself doing cardio but with no results.
- Been at my brother’s since Sunday and attending wedding functions so have been indulging/not tracking or exercising (there’s snow outside and I don’t have access to a gym) but his place has 3 storeys so I’ve been making the most of the stairs. Anxious about taking a break but looking forward to tracking again from Wednesday.
- ⁠Making sure that even if I’m indulging i’m having more proteins, less carbs atleast trying to make smart food choices.
- ⁠Can’t wait to go back home and get back on track.
27/12/2024, 6:31 pm - PF - Farah Salman: While doing deadlifts and side lunges, my lower back hurts(most probably jaha epidural lagta hai)

Build steps into your routine. 

Don’t take elevators. Take the stairs. 

Stop trying to park the car inside the shop. Was a few steps by parking a bit further away. 

Easier to find parking that way too.

28/12/2024, 3:25 am - PF - Bismah Nayyer: At first it’s tricky but you get used to it
28/12/2024, 3:30 am - PF - Bismah Nayyer: 1. Put everything far away and not in your home office or room obviously excluding the laptop/computer 😆
2. Then go get everything by yourself and avoid calling mom or sister or wife or partner or anyone 
3. ⁠if you can work on upper floor you would get to use stairs which is more steps like my home office is upstairs and my room , kitchen is downstairs so quite a few trips for different reasons 
4. ⁠if you don’t like walking just dance tbh 
5. ⁠if you can afford I would highly recommend to work from a cafe or co working space atleast 2-3 days a week

28/12/2024, 3:44 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Is this normal ?? Or only me
28/12/2024, 3:52 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Eating ? 😂 Or the question?
28/12/2024, 3:52 am - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Actually both
28/12/2024, 4:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Hahahaha i faced this a lot, a few years back when i was going to the gym but the results were not visible
28/12/2024, 4:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What about it
28/12/2024, 4:23 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Are these burned calories somewhat accurate?
28/12/2024, 10:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. Error rate on the watches can be quite high
28/12/2024, 11:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Burned calorie estimates from fitness trackers or machines are like admiring a mirage in a desert - it looks real but isn’t quite what it seems! 🤷🏽‍♂
It just looks pretty cool tho :p
28/12/2024, 12:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's kind of become normal now to some extent, since most people don't have emotional stability or are equipped to deal with emotions properly etc, so they rely on food for comfort, or distraction (or perhaps it provides a sense of safety??) hmm 🤔
28/12/2024, 12:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Disordered eating is a lot more complicated then just being a matter of emotional regulation. It's about the messaging we've received around food and our bodies as well, amongst other things. We tend to think of over consumption of food as being on a seperate scale than restrictive eating disorders but really it's a spectrum, both side of the spectrums are manifestations of the same underlying issues. So just like anorexia and bulimia can't be reduced to just emotional dysregulation, overconsumption can't really be either
28/12/2024, 12:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: You’re absolutely right! Disordered eating is indeed a multifaceted issue, and my earlier message barely scratches the surface (I was addressing the video she posted above and her question). Emotional regulation is just one piece of the puzzle - it intersects with societal messaging around food, body image, cultural expectations, and even past traumas. I also completely agree that overconsumption and restrictive eating behaviors exist on a spectrum, often stemming from shared underlying struggles, whether that's control, safety, or identity.

Thank you for bringing this up! It's also why it's important to look at the broader picture when discussing something as complex as our relationship with food. I’d love to hear more about your perspective if you’re open to sharing!
28/12/2024, 12:50 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: So I've been diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorders (without purging, so over consumption). And, again, it's such a multilayered thing that I'm just beginning to understand myself. But one insight I'd like to share, which was extremely eye opening for me, was that even in binge eating it's over restriction that drives the over consumption. Because if we try to restrict our intake too much (as so many of us have been taught to do with these fad diets), it's inevitably followed by a binge. I'd been focusing on my overeating my whole life but didn't even think to account for the periods of massive restriction because I didn't even think they were an issue.
28/12/2024, 1:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you for sharing this insight - it’s incredibly valuable and really highlights just how nuanced our relationship with food can be. And yes, the cycle of restriction and overconsumption is such an important piece of the puzzle that so many people don’t realize - I was in the same boat back in 2016-2017 when I competed in physique competitions. Like you said, we’re often taught to see overeating as 'the problem,' but the restrictive behaviors that fuel it go unnoticed or are even encouraged by diet culture (honestly, all those diets - keto, egg diet, etc., or anything that cuts out entire food groups - push this).

I am sure what you’ve shared will definitely resonate with others who haven’t considered the restrictive side of things. It also just reinforces how important it is to move away from rigid rules esp rigid diets and instead build a balanced and compassionate approach to food and our bodies (something we're trying to do within this community).

I’m really glad to hear you’ve been working with someone on this. Sounds like it's been very helpful to you! 🙌🏽❤
28/12/2024, 1:31 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I was the one who had full control of my cravings
I would buy a  small slice of tart/ cake and take 1 bite daily and finishes in 7 days.
8th day used to buy another slice.
I would not crave ice cream, donuts, or any particular food at all.
I was happy with my vv low calorie meals
Same meals daily. No variety .
No pasta rice or roti
Ppl used to think im depriving myself, but honestly, i wasn't because i wasn't attracted to foods at all.
I was skinny as per ppl, but for myself, i still had a lot of fat, which i wanted to lose(now when i see my pics khud pe ghussa ata hai..kahi se bhi moti nai thi.. nashukri ki saza milrae hai ab..height is 5'6..weight wento 50 kgs)

And now here i am..gained 7kgs.. always thinking about food.
Literally 24/7!!
Now i crave for alllllllllll kind of foods..
Koi dunia ka khana aisa nai hai ab jo mujhe pasand na ho...
Im never full/ satisfied with my meals.
I used to have chirya size food and used to get full for hourssss.
We used to go to a restaurant and never in my life i finished my plate and now after having full meals at a restaurant ghar anay k baad bhi i want to eat more.
 i eat more than my husband, more than anyone in my surroundings. And im still hungry.
I can now eat a full 2 lbs cake in one go/one sitting
And im not even kidding..

I have been to therapists, nutritionists,dieticians
But ab tak im still hanging there <This message was edited>
28/12/2024, 1:44 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Keep hanging
You will get there iA
28/12/2024, 1:50 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I also eat like there is no tomorrow.
It basically stems from the fact that food was removed from in front of me when i was a young girl on the pretext that i was getting “fat”

If i go back n see the pictures - i ask where is the fat but since i had all skinny cousins around - i was the fatest as per family norms.

Fat shamed since i was a kid and called all sorts of names to cow/hippo and what not. 

And the society doesnt stop to date. They just dont know where to shut up and not comment.

Now i am just working on myself to be a healthier and fitter version for my kids.
28/12/2024, 1:51 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I wait for your long msgs
Theres always so much depth to it
And so much to learn n apply
28/12/2024, 1:52 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Similar story.

Was skinny in the childhood and was told & also “thappified” by parents during meal times to eat more or finish. Then I ballooned up.

Lost weight twice with over restriction but gained it all back.

Never felt good enough about my weight even during almost normal weight times. I still wanted to get to a certain number. <This message was edited>
28/12/2024, 1:54 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Another thing is that we're not taught to tune into our body's signals. Since we're children, how much we eat is dictated by people around us. Either they tell us we should finish every bite on the plate no matter how full we are. Or they fat shame us and tell us we need to eat less. At no point are we taught keh eat mindfully, listen to what your body is telling you and eat as much as it needs in this moment. Awareness of that gut-brain connection is so important. At the end of the day, food is fuel and our body's signals are the utmost indicator of what kind of fuel we need and how different kinds of food impact us. Instead, our relationship with food is totally divorced from our embodied experience of it.
28/12/2024, 1:58 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Happens in my household every day
Explaining to the adults is also very difficult k bachon ko zabardasti na khilain 

The plate finishing thing is also insane
28/12/2024, 2:20 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Yeap, that's something I appreciate about this space. Even though I'm not fully active yet, I appreciate how the coaches emphasise that there are no good foods or bad foods. Foods don't have any sort of moral value, food is food!!
28/12/2024, 2:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Up until my 20s I struggled  gaining weight. And i still don't understand. I used to eat calorie dense food .high in ghee type contents paratha sugary stuff . High carb foods. There was less to no movement . Everywhere car and mostly studying or on computer. 

I came to UK in 2011 and got married 2012. Made my diet nutritional wise better started to walk everywhere and more active . Started to gain weight after having kids. Despite eating healthy .
28/12/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: One thing I understand tracking my calories. I am very mindful of eating . Even when I indulge in dessert or any favourite food. I can stop whenever I want. I don't go overboard .. but I noticed. My fat macro is always higher than protein and carbs. Those fats are healthy fats coming from avocado, seeds nuts , granola , butter and olive oil. 

So is it possible ? 
Even eating healthy can hinder fatloss ? If not being done strategically.
28/12/2024, 3:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Back then my weight was stuck to 42
28/12/2024, 3:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also , I worked and did uni . Both were very far apart.
28/12/2024, 4:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is why I’m so careful with my son, no restrictions, no weight related conversations in front of him. 

I also don’t use my food scale when he’s around. 

I’ve always said this, most of the eating disorders and body image issues that our generation has stems from our parents.
28/12/2024, 4:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For example, most of my clients that have a food that they can’t seem to resist, I always ask them the same question.

Let’s assume the food is chocolate. 

The questions I ask is, were you allowed to eat chocolate as a kid? Like no restrictions. 

That means you don’t have to finish dinner to get chocolate. You don’t get chocolate only as a treat on certain days and other similar rules around chocolate consumption. 

Almost always the answer is some kind of restriction was there.
28/12/2024, 5:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: For me, chocolate is my most high value food. And in therapy, while we were trying to figure out my relationship with chocolate, I remembered that my Abba used to get us chocolates from abroad. He would be traveling most of the time because of his job and, like any kid, I used to miss him like crazy. And when he'd return, he'd come with a suitcase laden with chocolates. So I realised that's when my hyper fixated relationship with chocolate began. It's honestly crazy how our relationship with food is shaped by so many different kinds of experiences and messages.
28/12/2024, 5:11 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I usualy binge at night. I recall that my time when I was young was when my parents sleep. Food and gaming with friends was my me time.
28/12/2024, 5:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Something like that could do it too
28/12/2024, 5:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I restrict my kids eating chocolates and sweets . Their dad has a sweet tooth and there were dental problems with him . Also my kids go over board with sweets when I don't stop .
28/12/2024, 5:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Food industry and eating habits are very much on the junk side if I don't stop them . Other families they rely on high fat take away food with very less nutrition

28/12/2024, 6:13 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Where can I share my bodygirth and weight and food tracking 
Here or FB post
28/12/2024, 6:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's from last few weeks
28/12/2024, 7:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but that’s also down to the family. We try to focus on wholesome healthy meals and then he can eat chocolates if he wants too. 

It’s up to the parents to teach them about balance because restriction can lead to eating disorders as per the scientific literature.
28/12/2024, 7:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: FB please.
28/12/2024, 8:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's only me who eats healthy . I live with in laws . They have horrible eating habits
28/12/2024, 8:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And health problems and obesity
28/12/2024, 8:43 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So i have to put a boundary and restrict them sometimes. Am I doing wrong ?
28/12/2024, 9:03 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Not in my opinion
28/12/2024, 9:49 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Nope!
28/12/2024, 9:51 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This is so true. This all comes from family. Even Body shaming of kids. We are very casual in it, we don't realize that it has a huge impact on the very beautiful and curious mind of a kid.

28/12/2024, 9:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s no right or wrong here in my opinion. You can better decide what’s good for your children given your circumstances. 

But I would encourage having a conversation with your in laws about their eating habits especially in front of the children. 

I say, If possible, because with the Pakistani culture and mindset this isn’t always possible especially with in laws. 

And if your kids are old enough then you can always talk to them and educate them about food choices.
28/12/2024, 9:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://www.instagram.com/growing.intuitive.eaters?igsh=OXh4a2EwaTc3aHJ4

She’s someone I learn a lot from when it comes to raising children with a healthy relationship with food.
28/12/2024, 10:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I can't have that conversation with them. It's complicated.. but kids are kids and get tempted specially little ones. On special occasions and gatherings I let them eat whatever they want but on a daily basis I sometimes need to stop them . 

My own husband drinks 2 3 cans of coke a day and it's really concerning.
28/12/2024, 10:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, kids will always learn from what they see. Especially the parents. 


But it’s great that you’re setting a good example for them at least. 

Go through her page, you might get some usuable insights.
28/12/2024, 11:07 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Does calorie counting get to your head sometime? Like i feel my impulsions/ binges after calorie counting does increase. 

My stress levels have increased immensely. 
I joined the program here 3 weeks back. And my dad has been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer around 2 weeks back. 
Now I don’t want to go around eating all the time because I’m stressed out. I tried eating at my maintenance but some days Id exceed. And then that would make me feel like shit. 

So i left calorie counting for now. Do you suggest any portion control or anything as of now. Or do you think I should calorie count hi? 

I don’t want to gain any weight, although that isn’t even something I’m focused on. But I don’t want to forget my health in between everything.
28/12/2024, 11:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: I'm sorry. Sending love and prayers for both of you.
29/12/2024, 10:07 am - PF - Rehan Shah: Hello and Salam @60193244266 & @923343773307 
I constantly have achy joints n muscle cramps (especially in my hands) sometimes the soreness goes away most of the times its there.. this makes me more lazy and lethargic to do physical activities.. what to do

For the past few days I have been putting in 6k or more steps in and counting my calories but during workouts feels slow and weak.. i know i will be 43 in another six months lols but do I need some multivitamins or minerals 

I drink 7 8 glass of water daily plus tea, black coffee or coke zero 🫣

I take 10,000 IUs of vitamin D3 drops basically 4 drop of 2500 IUs 2 to 3 times a week as I was deficient lately but better now
29/12/2024, 12:34 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: Will make these today 🫣😋

https://youtu.be/TWL8Z1LQ578?si=RcsGmyiflwKmohxx
29/12/2024, 1:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It could also be because of lack of exercise. 

Our joints agree and tend to lose strength and mobility with time unless you’re strengthening then. 

These issues are typical in our desi accidents because we don’t exercise or spend an active life.
29/12/2024, 1:24 pm - PF - Rehan Shah: Does that mean continue with the activities/ workouts and the aches will subside? Any multivitamins or supplements that you would recommend, creatine collagen etc 🫣
29/12/2024, 1:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Depends upon the aches really, if its not an injury then strengthening your muscles joints and ligaments is what you need 
before jumping on to supplements make sure your nutrition is good 
you are getting enough protein, your caloric intake is as per your requirements, eating a enough whole foods fruits n veggies
If you are doing all that its most likely that you won't have deficiencies but still if you are deficient then you can add supplements
29/12/2024, 2:27 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: Wolf's Law in action if we put more pressure on the bones they become thicker in response to the pressure.

29/12/2024, 2:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): pressure as per capacity apply krna chaheay na but unfortunately most of the trainers in Pakistan make their clients do such stuff
29/12/2024, 3:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We’ll be going home in a bit and then giving you access.
29/12/2024, 3:03 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I got access sir.
Thank you
29/12/2024, 3:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: As for supplements, fish oil can help with joints and inflammation but only if the other bigger stuff that @923441183411 mentioned is taken care of.
29/12/2024, 5:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If stress levels are high, I personally don’t track then. 

I might even reduce workouts to further cut back on additional stress. 

Workouts are great but they are a stress on your body. So is tracking and so is being in a deficit. 

So based on your goals for now, I’d say don’t worry about tracking and instead focus on things like portion sizes and protein intake. 

And aim for weight maintenance instead.
29/12/2024, 5:27 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Workouts keep me happy. I think I workout more when I’m stressed so idk about that. 

But yes, no tracking has made me less worried. And getting that thought out of my system here yesterday that I just can’t do that made it kinda better. Thankss!
29/12/2024, 6:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can keep doing the workouts then, stopping them isn’t the goal anyway. 

I reduce frequency from 5 to 4 days. And if you don’t want to reduce frequency then just reduce intensity somewhat.
29/12/2024, 11:47 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 sir I have join the community today.for the last 4 months I was doing 6 workouts in a week with 1 muscle each day. From now on I will start to follow your 5 day workout plan.as my goal is to loss some fat and also gain lean muscle mass at the same time.
So should I include some type of cardio excercises in it?If yes than what type of cardio should I do? 
Note.( I am walking 10-12k steps per day also)
29/12/2024, 11:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. You don’t need any more cardio.
29/12/2024, 11:58 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And Abs excercise?
30/12/2024, 12:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s also covered.

Like (you should not yogurt or milk at night or not eating 3 hours before bed) so is there any science behind that?

Whenever my back hurts i feel my hamstrings also get stiff
30/12/2024, 3:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the cause but they’re usually linked. 

It’s like a chain. If you’re lower back is stiff, it’s possible that your hamstrings are taking more load than usual
30/12/2024, 3:09 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Ahan
How to sort of release stiffness
Like when i bend for prayer its like both things are trying to stretch in opposite directions 😂
30/12/2024, 3:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Getting a couple of physio sessions can help. 

Sleep plays a big role too. 

And then long term, building strength and mobility in those muscles.

30/12/2024, 5:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Do you mean in terms of effectiveness for your goals, muscle engagement, or overall safety?
30/12/2024, 5:24 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Overall
30/12/2024, 5:25 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): And idk in supersets we have to do same muscles or different
30/12/2024, 5:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Supersets can target the same muscle group (like lateral raises + upright rows for shoulders) or opposing/different muscle groups (like biceps + triceps or chest + back). Both approaches are effective but serve different purposes:
- Same muscle group: Great for maximizing fatigue and muscle activation (e.g., shoulders in your case)
- Different muscle groups: Useful for saving time and letting one group rest while the other works
30/12/2024, 5:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: If your goal was efficiency today (to save some time), your superset of lateral raises and face pulls works well since both involve the shoulders and upper back, though they emphasize slightly different areas
30/12/2024, 6:46 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hy coaches,yesterday day I joined community and from today I was going to start 5 day workout plan but currently I am on 2 day trip and I have a pair of dumbbells with me.Should I do some exercises with it?if yes then recommend some exercises please.
30/12/2024, 6:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just start after 2 days. 2 days won’t make a big difference. 

Enjoy the trip instead.
30/12/2024, 6:52 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok sir and as my goal is to loss fat so should stick with the same calories(1700) or I should cut off some more calories?🤔
30/12/2024, 7:08 pm - PF - Nida Umer: How do we record the weight on leg press
Total weight of plates added or the weight of one plate
30/12/2024, 7:13 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Weighted?
30/12/2024, 7:16 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Can i do seated leg curls instead of lying
Lying ones are feeling comfortable on the back
30/12/2024, 7:16 pm - PF - Nida Umer: @60193244266
30/12/2024, 7:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is fine.
30/12/2024, 7:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup.
30/12/2024, 7:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: However you find it easier to remember and track
30/12/2024, 10:15 pm - PF - Ahmed Rao: Quick question, i seem to give up not because of actual failure but because of loosing my grip or pain in the forearms. This is worse for exercises on a pull day (lat pulldown, pull up etc). 

I got different suggestions, using straps or gloves or increasing weight and lowering reps.

What do you guys suggest?
30/12/2024, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Straps are life savers.

31/12/2024, 7:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Hey coaches, as someone who dislikes cooking or even standing in the kitchen, I'm thinking perhaps subscribing to a meal service so that at least one or two of my meals in the day will be accounted for accurately, calories wise. But I also feel like any changes I make should ideally be sustainable in the long run, and subscribing to a meal service is not necessarily so sustainable. What are your thoughts?
31/12/2024, 7:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. Fat loss isn’t technically supposed to sustainable. 

You shouldn’t have to lose weight forever. 

So using strategies that work in the short term isn’t a bad idea.
31/12/2024, 7:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Hmmm I didn't  even think of it that way. That's insightful, thank you

Like the others have said, please ignore these type of people who just  flap their gums mindlessly.

02/01/2025, 7:25 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Since I started tracking. I have to constantly think about food, my next food, and just hoarding calories so that I can eat later.
02/01/2025, 7:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just do glute bridges at home.
02/01/2025, 7:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why are you trying to hoard calories?
02/01/2025, 7:54 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: hmmmmmm… I like to eat late at night, when my kids are in the bed, comfort time.
02/01/2025, 7:54 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Helps to have cals available during that time.
02/01/2025, 7:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine, you can keep a larger chunk of calories for that time. But that doesn’t mean not eating before that

03/01/2025, 12:13 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not a big deficit. That’s a moderate one I’d say
03/01/2025, 12:15 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I had a fear that i might loss muscle if the deficit is big.
03/01/2025, 12:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Abhi tou start kiya hai. Stop overthinking things. 

Muscle loss has more to do with training, protein intake and sleep then it has with the size of your deficit.

03/01/2025, 12:58 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Please take into consideration the fact that the coaches guide each and everyone of us according to our daily routine, diet, lifestyle, activity, health issues (if any) and challenges we are facing. We should have faith in them and trust their expert opinion which is recommended to us.
03/01/2025, 12:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not realistic. It will be too low to be sustainable.
03/01/2025, 1:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That would mean, you don’t have ANY room to enjoy life and eat things that make you feel good. 

Which means you’re less likely to be able to sustain it. 

Which means you’re less likely to be able to make progress. 

This is why you don’t compare yourself to others. 

And even if you are, then you’re looking at the wrong things. His TDEE is 2200. That’s probably because he weighs more, or has a lot more muscle or is more active than you. 

And those are things that you can target, building more muscle over time so that you burn more calories at rest. 

This makes future weight loss or even weight maintenance easier and improves health too. 

You can also increase activity levels.

And there is an excercise seated leg curl i don’t have the machine for it in our gym so what should i instead of that particular excercise?
03/01/2025, 4:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: If an exercise feels easy, you can increase the weight slightly while keeping good form. Alternatively, you can add 1-2 reps per set. For the seated leg curl, you can substitute it with lying leg curls (if available) or Romanian deadlifts, which also target the hamstrings
03/01/2025, 4:42 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
03/01/2025, 5:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Thought sharing:

While I am happy with my progress. I realized that I have this feeling of “waiting”. Waiting to be able to eat my fav foods without any restriction.
03/01/2025, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why are you waiting and not incorporating your favorite foods in your diet?
03/01/2025, 6:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This is a lifestyle change
You shouldn’t have to wait
U need to learn to accomodate them in your life
03/01/2025, 6:13 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I guess I am thinking more like eating a whole pizza or a three-patty smash burger. 😛
03/01/2025, 6:15 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Calculate calories and eat it
And manage ur day accordingly 

More like sleep the rest of the day 😂
03/01/2025, 6:18 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: lol or fast for the day to eat all at once at dinner
03/01/2025, 6:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: I love that you’re sharing this because it’s something so many of us experience but rarely talk about openly. The idea of “waiting” to eat your favorite foods, like a whole pizza or burgers, or tubs of icecream, comes from a place of restriction. And honestly, I’ve been there too - thinking, “I’ll finish this chocolate before anyone else gets to it,” which just fed into a cycle of urgency and guilt. I had to remind myself that the world’s not ending tonight, and there’s always tomorrow if I want more. The same applies to other areas of life as well, you can't NOT rest and sleep and keep working because you want to make more money and travel the world. (that's just me providing reasoning that'd maybe make more sense to you)

The thing is, our eating habits aren’t just about food. Stress, lack of sleep, and even how we’ve been taught to view certain foods play a massive role. For instance, chronic stress can push us toward comfort foods because they feel safe, while poor sleep messes with hunger hormones, making it harder to stop at “just one slice” of pizza (remember food noise you talked about the other day? it's largely and primarily because of restriction and hormones). If you’ve restricted certain foods before, your brain might see them as scarce, almost like you’re in survival mode. This isn’t your fault, and it’s nothing to feel ashamed of - it’s just how our minds and bodies work. The sooner we accept that fact, the better for us to learn ways to move through it, with ease.

Instead of waiting, what if you allowed yourself to enjoy these foods now but in a way that feels intentional? You don’t have to eat the whole pizza to feel satisfied - maybe you plan a pizza night with friends or enjoy a few slices alongside other foods you love (it's not the pizza you want per se, but the idea of NOT being allowed aka restriction, is what's making you crave more). So incorporating these foods regularly can help shift your mindset from scarcity to abundance, which can make a huge difference over time (evidence-based way 😉)

What I’ve found helpful - and what might work for you too -is:

1. Being mindful of your patterns. Journal what’s happening when these cravings hit so it’s not just unconscious behavior
2. Dropping the judgment. No food is “good” or “bad.” Seeing pizza or burgers as neutral takes away the guilt
3. Checking in with yourself. Ask: Am I actually hungry, or am I stressed, bored, or looking for comfort? Either answer is valid, but knowing the “why” helps massively
4. Structuring meals. Balanced meals with protein, fiber, and healthy fats keep you full longer, so those cravings don’t feel uncontrollable
5. Including indulgent foods in your daily intake. Making space for them every day. YESSS, even pizza -can change the way you approach food entirely

None of this is about being perfect; it’s about building a relationship with food that feels balanced, intentional, and free from “waiting.” 

Maybe we could do an exercise with everyone reading this, and understand where we're holding back, okay? So tell us what’s one indulgent food you’d like to enjoy this week, and how can we plan it into your routine?
03/01/2025, 6:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: #YeahAtThisPointIamNOTSORRY!!^
03/01/2025, 6:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And to add to that;

This mindset does ultimately come from a place of restriction and looking at food as a reward.

That’s not a super healthy approach to food in general and you probably won’t find people that maintain a relatively lean physique go for those sort of habits. 

Look at it this way, if you’re craving a burger, you can easily eat one daily and manage it in your calories. You can occasionally even eat a double patty one if you want. 

But a triple patty is likely overkill and for what reason? Like what does the triple patty give you that the double patty doesn’t? 

And would you even want one if you were regularly incorporating these foods into your routine? Probably not because that food would no longer hold that power over you. 

You crave it, you eat it and move on. So that mindset that I have to wait slowly starts to shift. 

And like Taha mentioned, the food isn’t going anywhere. I promise. lol. 

Also, another approach is that YOU CAN decide to eat a full pizza as long as you understand that it’ll be super high in calories and you might not lose weight this week. 

Nothing wrong with that either.

Afterall, this isn’t a sprint but a marathon and so the speed doesn’t matter. What matters is crossing that finish line, even if it takes longer than expected.
03/01/2025, 6:34 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I’d like to enjoy that sicilian pizza from Delish, a smash burger with bun and oh yea, zinger, and some french fries.
03/01/2025, 6:34 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: and some wings, maybe?
03/01/2025, 6:35 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: > But a triple patty is likely overkill and for what reason? Like what does the triple patty give you that the double patty doesn’t? 

Hmm, need to think.. the feeling of fulness .. even though I would feel super shitty after it.
03/01/2025, 6:36 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: > And would you even want one if you were regularly incorporating these foods into your routine? Probably not because that food would no longer hold that power over you. 

I actually feel really shitty after eating these things. Like I cheated. Even if I eat a slice. I would feel like it’s a waste.
03/01/2025, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. That’s a pretty strong sign that we need to work on your relationship with food. 

And these feelings are because of that restrictive mindset and viewing foods as good or bad.
03/01/2025, 6:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Literally eat a burger 2-3 times a week to be very honest.
03/01/2025, 6:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And I’m close to being the leanest I’ve been in like 5 years.
03/01/2025, 6:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Acha.
03/01/2025, 6:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Thank you for sharing
03/01/2025, 7:25 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I’ll try to incorporate my favourite foods.
03/01/2025, 7:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Go have Mr burger hahahaha

04/01/2025, 1:42 am - Taha Ahmed: He either:  

1. Copied the message, removed the other parts, kept the part he wanted to respond to, and added a ">" at the start
2. Or, he used Samsung’s text capture feature to copy the specific part and did the same as above

04/01/2025, 2:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I did landmine anti rotation first time . Two days ago. I'm still sore in my shoulder area and obliques. It was just a barbell weight. No other weight .
04/01/2025, 2:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It was challenging too
04/01/2025, 2:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is it ok to feel it in shoulders and arms ? Or my form was not correct
04/01/2025, 4:50 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm also sore in my upper back. Is this normal ?@
04/01/2025, 4:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. It’s a rotational movement that works the obliques to a large extent. 

Also involves your core and arms
04/01/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This has motivated me to try

05/01/2025, 10:48 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: How many calories or time it takes to gain 1 kg of fat?
05/01/2025, 12:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Approx ~7700 calories surplus
05/01/2025, 12:27 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Like if over eat about 1300 calories per day for week consistently.this when I will gain 1 kg of fat?
05/01/2025, 12:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: If your maintenance is, say, 2000 kcal per day (or 14,000 kcal per week), then yes, in theory, if you consumed 7,700 kcal extra over a week, you would gain 1kg of fat
05/01/2025, 12:58 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Oky
05/01/2025, 1:43 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Today I gained 2 lbs on the scale which should be water weight.
05/01/2025, 1:43 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 2 lbs would be 7k calories which I have not consumed
05/01/2025, 1:44 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Sucks to see the scale go up 📈 :/
05/01/2025, 1:44 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Check week average
05/01/2025, 1:46 pm - PF - Nida Umer: We shouldnt focus on daily changes coz the scale moves do to various reasons
05/01/2025, 1:46 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Did u weigh at the same time u did previously
05/01/2025, 1:47 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yes
05/01/2025, 1:47 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Dont be upset m sure the coaches can help
05/01/2025, 1:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Stress, sleep and food in your GI are the only reasons for this bump (if you didn't overeat your calories)

05/01/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey coaches? 
Does whey protein cause acne? 

If Yes, Tou Kia kerain, any guide?
05/01/2025, 2:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): It doesnt cause acne unless you are lactose intolerant
if you are lactose intolerant then use isolate or hydrolyzed whey n you will be fine <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 2:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, stress, sleep, and similar factors can cause the body to retain more water as a stress response, which leads to weight gain - nothing to be stressed about! :)
05/01/2025, 2:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Where did you get your protein powder from?
05/01/2025, 2:54 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: When ever there is a dawat or outing with friends i save calories for it but sometimes I over eat there i really control my self not to over eat but aik chamach or ya bas aik bite aur ismay calories zyada hojati hay. Need to some tips
05/01/2025, 2:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Someday it's fine to take whey protein and some days   acne and headache issues.

On my previous query about whey protein, sameet said the same about lactose intolerant. 

I never had any issues with dairy products. Any test jis se mujhy pata chal sakay k am I lactose intolerant?
05/01/2025, 2:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: My brother brought it from Canada.
05/01/2025, 2:56 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
05/01/2025, 2:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: The lactose intolerance test, aka the hydrogen breath test, is a common way to determine if you're lactose intolerant. AKUH offers this test!

If you're occasionally experiencing acne and headaches, check if you're:

- Staying properly hydrated (dehydration can also cause headaches)
- Identifying any other foods that might be the real culprit
- Noting how many hours you slept the night before

It’s likely not lactose intolerance, but rather a combination of other factors!
05/01/2025, 3:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: It could be some preservative/flavoring etc too that might be causing this issue. Perhaps try changing the brand and see if the issue persists - I'm offering this advice because you're okay with consuming other dairy products <This message was edited>
05/01/2025, 3:10 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Winters and dehydration - Yupe

It happens on weekends or the days when I'm sleeping till late/Noon, and obviously  having breakfast/lunch late. ~ bloating.

 I'm sure I should change my weekend's pattern to access the related things/factores. 

What you say?
05/01/2025, 3:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, give it a try and see how your body responds to this new or changed routine. I had a client who started taking whey and thought it was causing her headaches, but she was actually severely dehydrated. Increasing her protein intake just added more stress to her body.  
Whether you're drinking whey or eating more high-protein foods, hydration is key - not only for optimal functioning but also to support proper bowel movements. :)
05/01/2025, 3:18 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Im using protein works whey powder.
I have been using it since years now
But recently i was having weird kind of stomach ache
I stopped taking protein powder fr a week and my stomach is little better now
Im not sure about the reason 
But could it be due to the whey protein  ?
05/01/2025, 3:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This totally makes sense to me. Let's try it. 🙌

Thanks! 🙂
05/01/2025, 3:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: There could be a lot of factors;
- other foods you eat with it
- not drinking enough water (dehydration)
- not enough fiber
- constipation (high protein can aggravate the symptoms if you're already constipated)
- any other protein source
- whey (it'd be the last on the list, I think!)

05/01/2025, 4:02 pm - PF - Farah Salman: For fibre, i take weetabix regularly as im always constipated 
Water intake, summers k agay thora kam hogaya hai but i try to drink water as much as possible 
And ive just stopped taking whey powder since last 4 5 days
Baqi sab tu wohi hai
And stomachache got better
05/01/2025, 4:13 pm - Taha Ahmed: You need around 25-30g of fiber a day (it's better if its soluble fiber)
05/01/2025, 4:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes it can be due to some other reason n not the whey because the brand is same n it was fine previously
dehydrtion, koe food shaid suit na kr raha ho digestion ma issue ho us sy stomach discomfort ho rhi ho
05/01/2025, 7:45 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coaches,
I am using broiler chicken daily from last 4 months to meet my protein goals. So is it safe to use it daily?
Quantity (100-150g)
05/01/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): we have been eating broiler all our life ~300g atleast & we are absolutely fine
broiler is absolutely safe to use even i posted a reel on broiler aaj e
05/01/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bro, I’ve been using it for the last 12 years daily.
05/01/2025, 7:51 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I have seen your video on it on instagram in which you say that it is safe if use in (Moderation) that’s why I asked
05/01/2025, 7:53 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro jis quantity ma aap ly rhy 100-150 its well within moderation

Today I tried my 4-5 year old dress for dawat and it fitted me so well lol  🎉 Hehehe. 

Even though I'm super lazy in my steps and workout, but yes the calories thing is working so well along with mindfulness.

I have my old dresses as targets to fit in. Hahahaha 😂

Thank you 😊😋
06/01/2025, 12:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha that’s amazing 🤟🏼
06/01/2025, 12:26 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Congratulations

06/01/2025, 3:22 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coaches,
I was having a little fever today so I take some medicine and now feeling a little good so should I workout today or take rest? I have just 3 workouts last week with Saturday and Sunday as restdays.(I am following 5 day gym workout plan)
06/01/2025, 3:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d take a rest day because you still have fever. The medication is why it’s gone down.
06/01/2025, 3:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
06/01/2025, 5:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I did an upper body workout yesterday . If I do legs today. Would it be ok. I usually eat after a workout. But I am fasting. 
What do you recommend. Doing weights or just cardio ??? 

Fast will open at 4.15 
I will go workout at 2.15
06/01/2025, 5:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can train legs today. No issue.
06/01/2025, 5:35 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Is it necessary to train speartae groups daily ?
Y can't we do full body daily?
06/01/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Muscles require rest
06/01/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We can but recovery might be suboptimal if you’re training daily or even 5-6 days per week
06/01/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s better to do full body when training 3-4 times per week.
06/01/2025, 6:29 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Hi plz help i get super hungry in winters and end up eating extra food
06/01/2025, 6:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Do volume eating . Nutrition dense foods.
06/01/2025, 6:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And a lot of fibre
06/01/2025, 6:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: And lots and lots of water
06/01/2025, 6:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Those are good suggestions. 

Also things like soups and all can come handy, they make you warm and also aren’t high in calories. 

Can always add protein and fibre to them to make them even more filling.
06/01/2025, 7:05 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Having a big breakfast with good protein keeps me full for a long time. And chewing well, add cinnamon on snacks like apple, porridge , pancakes. 
Green tea also suppresses appetite. (Just sharing what works for me)
06/01/2025, 7:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah caffeine has an appetite suppressant effect.
06/01/2025, 7:17 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: How many calories are there in sushi which has cooked/fried prawns? <This message was edited>

06/01/2025, 7:23 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: i thought this was calories of just one roll
06/01/2025, 7:23 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: phew, it’s of 6-8
06/01/2025, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha
06/01/2025, 7:52 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: I have a question:
If we are eating same meal for a week like.. because its easy to cook.. and almost its a comfort meal.. or taking nuts daily?
So does it makes it a diet?
06/01/2025, 7:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Anything you eat is a diet. 

What you probably mean is if it’ll lead to weight loss. Well, that depends on calories.
06/01/2025, 7:54 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok... So eating same meal is not the problem?
06/01/2025, 8:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): not at all
06/01/2025, 8:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: gyms are too cold, takes a while to warmup <This message was edited>
06/01/2025, 8:10 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Is there any difference in calories between a multi grain roti and normal wheat roti?
06/01/2025, 8:11 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: The place from where i order has named that sushi crunchy maki 
It has fried prawn in it and sometimes they drizzle some sauce also on sushi roll.
06/01/2025, 8:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Multigrain usually has more calories.
06/01/2025, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: @923343773307 would know would Maki is. 

I, on the other hand, have never had sushi so no idea lol
06/01/2025, 8:15 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Ok no problem
06/01/2025, 8:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Saraiki main maki corn ko kehte hain 😝
06/01/2025, 8:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So maki and sushi are pretty much the same. Maki has seaweed on the outside. Sushi has it on the inside. The rest is the same. 

So I’d use the California roll calories.
06/01/2025, 8:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Woh Makai hai. At least that’s what we call it in Karachi.
06/01/2025, 8:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, both California roll and Maki Sushi are pretty much the same thing. Maki often has some kind of meat in it- prawn, crab, fish, etc
06/01/2025, 8:53 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This guide is so good
06/01/2025, 8:57 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Will shrimp tempura work for crunchy maki as this has fried shrimp?

06/01/2025, 11:04 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hi,
I have a question. I hope many can relate to it.

100g protein is my daily goal. But 4-5 days a week, i consumed 85-95g most of the time. 100g twice a week he complete ho pata. Is it okay?

Or we are strict to some number. Damgh Mai random sawal aya tou I asked. 

I'm okay with my protein intake because it's the first time I'm having high protein foods and my body is adjusting gradually to it.
06/01/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if its in 90-100g range then thats fine as long as you are working on your dietary pattern to hit the protein intake goal eventually
06/01/2025, 11:15 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Of course with a dietary pattern.👍 
Being vegetarian and high carbs food intakes all life, it takes time to develop tastes portions and body adjustments.
06/01/2025, 11:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Thats absolutely fine

I have been noticing this a lot too now since my last discussion here around feeling restricted by food. A lot of fitness influencers revolve around it.
07/01/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks fine.
07/01/2025, 1:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Most of the industry revolves around this.
07/01/2025, 10:59 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: A lot of them are grifters too so there's that
07/01/2025, 11:35 am - PF - Humaida: @60193244266 @923343773307 if i feel like i have the energy to continue another week before i take the deload, its okay right?
07/01/2025, 11:47 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes if you have the energy to continue, your protein intake sleep rest recovery is good then you can continue
07/01/2025, 12:40 pm - PF - Humaida: Great. Thanks!

07/01/2025, 2:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's better to focus on rest and recovery first before putting your body under more stress. It won't benefit you, your body, or your goals. Let it subside, and you can always return to it later
07/01/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Will this break from workout have any effect on my muscle growth?And when i start let’s say i take a 5 days rest from workout.so should with The same intensity and weight?
07/01/2025, 2:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
07/01/2025, 2:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And you can start with a slightly lower intensity.
07/01/2025, 2:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Somewhere around 3-2RiR
07/01/2025, 2:12 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok you mean to say that i should decrease 2-3 reps in every excercise?
07/01/2025, 2:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I mean you should leave 2-3 reps in the tank in every exercise. 

Aim for 7RPE or 3RIR and then build up
07/01/2025, 2:13 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok sir

07/01/2025, 3:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We don’t do diet plans. Have you gone through the guide on Facebook?
07/01/2025, 3:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Anday wali diet 😆😜
07/01/2025, 3:36 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Should we login rice before cooking or after cooking it?
07/01/2025, 3:43 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Most members log it cooked
07/01/2025, 3:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can do both. Depends on how and when you weigh it.
07/01/2025, 8:26 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey everyone,
I have been hearing a lot about healthy and unhealthy foods.Like there is a lot of content on social media which tells that complex carbs is healthy compare to simple carbs and that you should not consume fast foods and fried foods.
So my question is that it’s just a matter of calories or there is foods that are unhealthy like trans fat,fried food etc
07/01/2025, 8:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you ask this on Facebook?
07/01/2025, 8:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: More people will benefit if we cover this in detail there.

For someone who drinks 8 cups of tea or coffee a day and likes it sweetened, this definitely saves a ton of calories from sugar. Just thought I’d share that with you all!
08/01/2025, 3:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Is that stevia? 🤢🤮
08/01/2025, 3:06 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: I don’t like the after taste of stevia
08/01/2025, 3:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Same.
08/01/2025, 3:06 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Monk fruit sweetner works for me.. but i have seen many ppl who can stick to stevia
08/01/2025, 3:06 am - Taha Ahmed: The left one? Yes. But it's a blend of stevia, sucralose and lactose. That's why I got it cause I also hate the taste of stevia :p
08/01/2025, 3:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Stevia is much better than this shit though.
08/01/2025, 3:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Lactose?
08/01/2025, 3:07 am - Taha Ahmed: Yup! Apparently all new ones have lactose + sucralose, which isn't really good for those with lactose intolerance <This message was edited>
08/01/2025, 3:07 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Lol really..
08/01/2025, 3:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
Nothing comes close to sucralose. 

Aspartame is okay too but has an aftertaste that I’m not too fond of.
08/01/2025, 3:09 am - Taha Ahmed: I can't find this in Karachi - so had to resort to these local ones
And yes, aspartame tastes weird
08/01/2025, 3:09 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: <Media omitted>
08/01/2025, 3:10 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: This is the one I use..
08/01/2025, 3:10 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Canderal has sucralose variants
08/01/2025, 3:23 am - Taha Ahmed: How does it taste?
08/01/2025, 3:24 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Pretty good TBh.. like I had no issue switching to it..
08/01/2025, 3:25 am - Taha Ahmed: Okay, I got stevia today and just tried it for the first time. Definitely the last time, though! Sticking to sucral from now on until I find a better alternative in Karachi. Lol!
08/01/2025, 3:25 am - Taha Ahmed: I can't find it yar! Sirf aspartame wala mil raha hai :/ the one in red packing

08/01/2025, 3:48 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Ye kia hai guys ?
08/01/2025, 3:51 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Another sweetener. Based on saccharin. 
I think the brand Sweet n Low also uses saccharin.
08/01/2025, 5:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Is Saab taste discussion k baad, without sugar chai is best 😂 #somehowtastefatigue 

Well, Sucral is better in the local market so far. At start, it tasted like bohat zayda ajeeb but now it's fine.
08/01/2025, 5:04 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Is this ok?

Patlay logo ko ziada sardi lagti hai?🤪🙈
08/01/2025, 1:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, having more body fat works as insulation and helps retain body heat, and it makes you feel less cold too!
08/01/2025, 1:13 pm - PF - Farah Salman: No wonder this year, im feeling less cold :(
08/01/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Mujy 95-105g protein allow hai jis main  
Main 2 eggs(130gm) in the morning then 200gm
Chicken breast lunch then 150 gm
Chicken breast dinner
Phir b mjhy mfp pay 130gm show karta hai ??? Why
08/01/2025, 2:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: 95-106 protein baseline number hai - this is what you must target everyday!
2eggs + 350gm chicken will give you roughly ~96gm of protein

If it's showing 130g, tou entries mai kuch issue hosakta hai. Aap raw chicken weigh karke track kar rahi hain ya cooked?
08/01/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Omey Farwa Salman: Raw … actually Meny 3 days ka banaya 600gm lunch and 450gm dinner

Monkfruit ka tu koi  after taste na ata <This message was edited>
08/01/2025, 4:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just don’t find it similar to sugar. 

Stevia, I’m not a fan of the aftertaste either.
08/01/2025, 4:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sucralose for me is closest to sugar. That and aspartame (though canderal has a bit of an aftertaste too)
08/01/2025, 4:14 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 😐 LOL
08/01/2025, 4:14 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Same!🙈☠️

08/01/2025, 4:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But I’ll add monk fruit to my morning coffee for you guys. 

In the name of science, I’m willing to put my tastebuds on the line. 

Will report back tomorrow on this. 

If all you are charged an extra subscription fee, know that the experiment didn’t go well 🤣🤣
08/01/2025, 4:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: Get Sucral - one tab is good enough for me (sweetness wise) and I use like 5-6 tabs every day with my tea and coffee
08/01/2025, 4:16 pm - PF - Nida Umer: U know I am Team Sameet right😇
08/01/2025, 4:16 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I use lakanto (monkfruit + ethyriol) daily in my latte.

08/01/2025, 4:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: For me it depends, sometimes I want tea with sugar and sometimes no sugar.
I use Sucral now a day.

The same goes for coffee, some time with sugar and kabhi americano or espresso shots.
08/01/2025, 4:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: But namak wali chai. 😉 Hahahahahahahah 
Kashmiri chai a bit salted tastes well. Hehehe
08/01/2025, 4:41 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: btw, 1 tsp sugar is only 16 calories
08/01/2025, 4:41 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: chai without sugar is a dead chai to me ☠️
08/01/2025, 4:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s 1tsp which is 5g
08/01/2025, 4:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The way most people add teaspoons, it’s 40-50 calories.
08/01/2025, 4:42 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: heaped?
08/01/2025, 4:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah
08/01/2025, 4:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Heaped to the point that it’s overflowing
08/01/2025, 4:43 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Important info 😛
08/01/2025, 4:43 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Lol
But apas ki bat hai

Only with sugar 🙈
08/01/2025, 4:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
There you go. And then tsp sizes vary too. Some can hold more than this
08/01/2025, 4:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And now people add 2 of these
08/01/2025, 4:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And have tea 3-4 times a day
08/01/2025, 4:44 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ahh, right
08/01/2025, 4:45 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: milk is usually 150ml in a chai, I think
08/01/2025, 4:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Which can make it 72g of sugar a day and 72*4=288 calories.
08/01/2025, 4:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Which is equivalent to slightly more than 2 rotis
08/01/2025, 4:45 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Tsp pe Khush na honay dena. Yeh zulm hai.😜😂
08/01/2025, 4:45 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 100 calories from milk + 50 cals from sugar = 150 cals
08/01/2025, 4:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Khush nahin khushfemi hata raha hoon 😂
08/01/2025, 4:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Ab leveler dhondo chamach ka
08/01/2025, 4:46 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: imagine how little sugar that would be lol

08/01/2025, 4:47 pm - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>

08/01/2025, 4:49 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I HOPE SO!
08/01/2025, 4:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s never a tsp. I’ll just leave it at that.
08/01/2025, 4:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah probably better than most. 

But ghee isn’t melted.
08/01/2025, 4:49 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ghee ka pahar (mountain) ban sakta hai chamach mai, true
08/01/2025, 4:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm not going to weigh it. Hahahaha.

08/01/2025, 5:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: I've been eating 6-8 eggs a day for months, and guess what? My health markers were all perfectly fine.

There's actual evidence supporting up to 28 eggs a week / 4 eggs a day as totally okay.

08/01/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: random question reading the chats above, how do you guys measure the oil you take? 
i take the smallest spoon i have and assume it's 1 tsp :p
08/01/2025, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sweet greens is generally more reliable than evergreen.
08/01/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Glycemic index wise as well ?
08/01/2025, 5:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Almost but glycemic index is an outdated concept. 

Because unless you’re having sugar by itself, the glycemic index changes. Even in tea, there’s milk so it will change.
08/01/2025, 5:40 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Measuring spoon se
08/01/2025, 5:40 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: should invest in those
08/01/2025, 5:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If using oil, I’ll just measure it out of the bottle. 

Spoon bhi Ganda nahin hoga 🤣
08/01/2025, 5:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: My parents take gurr sometimes instead of sugar when craving for sweet tea both are diabetic hence the question 😶‍🌫
08/01/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Weighing scale, measuring spoon best investment
08/01/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: like weigh it before and after? I'm confused sorry :p
08/01/2025, 5:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For diabetes, switching to sweeteners is probably the best approach.
08/01/2025, 5:43 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: This is the sweetener they use
08/01/2025, 5:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Put the bottle on the machine, turn it on or press rare if already on. 

It’ll show zero. Add oil to pan and put bottle back on machine. It’ll show how much you used. 

Get shocked. Shed a few tears. Log it in the app and MOVE ON 🤣
08/01/2025, 5:44 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Hahahaha
08/01/2025, 5:44 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Can’t afford to be shocked 😛
08/01/2025, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Another idea is to add oil to spray bottles and then spray it in to the pan.
08/01/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Last night ami made rice with 2 tbsp oil... 200 calories to aise he urr gae
08/01/2025, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That way it won’t be a shock cause you can check after 3-4 sprays
08/01/2025, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Assuming woh 2 tbsp, 2tbsp hi thay
08/01/2025, 5:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 🤣😱
08/01/2025, 5:46 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yes measuring spoons 😂

08/01/2025, 8:55 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: <Media omitted>
This came for free with my protein powder. I have absolutely no idea how to take this or what this is? I saw Creatine written on it and I am not sure if I should be using this as I am trying to loose weight and fat. Should I take this as a pre workout or should I leave it for later?
08/01/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Send the label as well for better understanding of ingredients
08/01/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Shireen Yasir: <Media omitted>
08/01/2025, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Switch to incline pushups.
08/01/2025, 10:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a pre workout type supplement with creatine.
08/01/2025, 10:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But keep in mind it has 300mg caffeine so only take it in the day otherwise
It’ll disturb sleep.
09/01/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hi,
Do we have a video/post regarding the intake of creatine on FB or here?
09/01/2025, 2:11 am - PF - Ali Hassan: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1GRg4WfnA8/

Today's update 82.8 after alott of up n down


Ab aaj mujhai out of city  jana hai 3 days k liye ... plz suggest kesai meal lon k weight gain na ho
09/01/2025, 10:59 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): First of all congrats on this amazing progress 
Secondly 3 days ma koe khaas gain hona nhi hai unless u eat alot of calories above your maintainance (~7700 calories to gain 1kg). Most of it will be water weight jo chala jaega as soon as u get back to routine. 
With meals priorotize protein intake & control portions. Keep your activity level high if possible n u will be just fine
09/01/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Amna Awais: Okay 
Best of luck to me
09/01/2025, 12:32 pm - You removed PF - Ahmed Rao
09/01/2025, 12:32 pm - You removed PF - Hussain Murtaza
09/01/2025, 12:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: I was reading this book and stumbled upon something Rumi said that struck me as deeply profound. It got me thinking about how this applies to health and wellness. Rumi speaks of love as a bridge- a connection between you and everything else. For our health and fitness goals, self-love and self-care form the foundation of that bridge, ensuring it’s strong and secure enough to carry us forward

Without that solid grounding in your own well-being, it becomes harder to navigate challenges like building habits or staying consistent (something many of us struggle with, and in some ways, it's what drives our motivation as well, to some extent). Starting with respect for your body and mind shifts the focus from punishment or extremes to growth and balance. This approach not only leads to lasting success but also makes the journey sustainable and fulfilling.

What are your thoughts? <This message was edited>
09/01/2025, 1:30 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Loved the thought. 

I keep reminding myself of how everyone say YOLO - You only live once. 
That’s how generally people say that you should eat everything and anything because what if you’re not there tomorrow. So cheat meals hon, sab kha jao type feeling.
BUT
I feel since you’re only given one life, might as well treat your body like you’re not getting another. I’m never going to be the age that I am right now, I’m only gonna grow older. But that doesn’t have to mean negative. I can nourish my body, keep it healthy and enjoy my life- since I’m going to get one life only 💕
09/01/2025, 1:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. YOLO for me means that you’ve only got one life, you can either spend that in pain and potentially bed rest when older or be active and enjoy life till 80.
09/01/2025, 2:32 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Just wanted to share the fluctuation today. My weight went down by 2 lbs over the day which was a surprise for me. Lol <This message was edited>
09/01/2025, 2:33 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: What do you guys suggest.. when should we check weight? Daily at the same time?
09/01/2025, 2:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In the morning before you have breakfast or water
09/01/2025, 2:34 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Also in the workouts.. what if we do more exercise... should we? Or it will be over training?
09/01/2025, 2:34 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok👍
09/01/2025, 2:35 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Ab ismay true fat loss pata lagana muskil hai.. I need to track my measurements.
09/01/2025, 2:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t need to. If you have the capacity to do more then that likely means you’re not lifting heavy enough weights
09/01/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Okay👍
09/01/2025, 2:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I do those same workouts and it takes me over an hour and I’m dead by the end.
09/01/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok got it.. i should increase weight then... or should i increase one more set? What so you prefer?
09/01/2025, 2:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): increase weights
09/01/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Ok
09/01/2025, 2:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No need to add sets. Just lift heavier weights.
09/01/2025, 2:53 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: Roll samosi chicken wali homemade jo hain wo kese track krni hain?

09/01/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Farah Salman: <Media omitted>
Pehle isko ghar le k jaon.

09/01/2025, 5:29 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Till 90's or 100's as well :p
09/01/2025, 5:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I was considering them fried.
09/01/2025, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oil is separate. Calories can easily double.
09/01/2025, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh 50g tak hoga probably
09/01/2025, 5:43 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: The same goes for samosa. Right

If yes, I consumed double in the last few days 😂 Khair! 🙊 <This message was edited>
09/01/2025, 5:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Do let me know about samosa, whether it's raw or fried in MFP?
09/01/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. A samosa can aboard 150-300 calories of oil
09/01/2025, 5:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on the entry
09/01/2025, 5:53 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How many calories in Raw samosa? Generally? A small and medium one.
09/01/2025, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably 120-200
09/01/2025, 6:39 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Bad sleep affected my workout today. Failed on 2nd set of bench press which I was moving nicely in the last workout. <This message was edited>

09/01/2025, 6:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes lack of sleep or improper sleep cycle do impact workouts
09/01/2025, 6:42 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: feeling exhausted today becUse both my kids are sick and 1 year old has disturbed sleep because of cold <This message was edited>
09/01/2025, 6:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u can slight lower the intensity on days like these
09/01/2025, 6:44 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: ya reduced load by 10% for 3rd set
09/01/2025, 10:52 pm - You added PF - Rahima Shahid
10/01/2025, 3:17 am - Taha Ahmed: Hello everyone,

I hope you’re all doing great! I wanted to take a moment to share some feedback we’ve received about our WhatsApp groups, particularly the Tracking Corner.

At times, this group becomes a bit cluttered with non-urgent messages or off-topic discussions. While these chats can be engaging, they often make it harder for others to find important information or ask questions- this has been a recurring concern in the feedback we’ve received. It also limits our ability as coaches to provide timely and focused support to everyone.

Here’s how we can keep things streamlined and effective for everyone:

1. Use the Tracking Corner group only for urgent or specific food tracking-related questions or feedback that haven’t already been answered. (If you’re unsure, try searching the Facebook group first- if the answer isn’t there, feel free to ask us directly!)

2. *For general questions* , curiosities, or broader discussions, the Facebook group is the perfect place to post.

3. *For community chats* - sharing recipes, memes, IG posts, or having lighthearted conversations daily- we’ve created a new group! If this interests you, join the fun here: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BfNJ3c3rTNQFLE16cP3nUS

By keeping the *_Tracking Corner_* and *_Core Community_* groups focused, we ensure they remain accessible and manageable for all. It’s unfair to those who check in after a long day to sift through 100+ notifications to find relevant updates or answers, etc.

If you’ve read and acknowledged this message, there’s no need to reply- just leave a “👍” reaction so we know we’re aligned.

Thank you for helping us maintain a supportive, organized, and effective community.

P.S.: For questions or discussions that could benefit everyone, the Facebook group is an amazing space to share and engage with the wider community.

 *Note:*  _Joining the new group is entirely optional- if you’re not interested in daily chats, you don’t need to join. This is simply to ensure that the main groups remain focused on their core purpose, as also mentioned in our Starter Guide._

Thank you for your understanding. 🙏🏽

*Much love,*

10/01/2025, 8:02 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Anyways thxx
10/01/2025, 8:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: If you think others would like the recipes too then you can share it here (if it's genuinely good)

If you want to have a discussion about it (maybe you've got a question etc), that let's say will be over 3-4 text messages, do it in the other group or post it on Facebook (so it's searchable and people can go back to it later)

Thank you for understanding 🙏🏽 we're trying to be mindful of everyone here
11/01/2025, 10:54 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coache,

11/01/2025, 11:32 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923138979695 could you please post this on Facebook? It will be beneficial for the community when someone searches keywords like stress or illness related topics

12/01/2025, 12:29 am - Taha Ahmed: Those tests can be expensive so I'd suggest you speak with a gastroenterologist first and see what they recommend. Might save you a couple thousands aik consult ke baad!

And you might not even need any test. 🤷🏽‍♂ <This message was edited>
12/01/2025, 12:33 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Right. 👍 Thank you! 

Mai ne aisay socha hi nhe. Lol. 😂
12/01/2025, 12:34 am - Taha Ahmed: That's exactly why we are here! 😋
12/01/2025, 12:35 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hahahah. Jee, coach SB. 🤪
12/01/2025, 12:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What food allergy test are they recommending? Hopefully not IgG <This message was edited>
12/01/2025, 12:39 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes. This test. 
3gAllergy Specific IgE Universal Food Allergens.

They say, yahe test hota hai for any intolerance or allergy. 🤷🏻‍♀️ <This message was edited>
12/01/2025, 12:56 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: IgG and IgE are seperate tests.
12/01/2025, 12:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s oral testing, right?
12/01/2025, 12:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And not a skin test
12/01/2025, 1:00 am - PF - Ali Haider: Need some help!
I moved to Lisbon recently. 
Currently struggling to get settled here.

How do I manage diet/caloric intake meanwhile?
Also my migraines are triggered maybe because of stress and home sickness.

What could I eat daily to at least fulfil my fiber intake
12/01/2025, 1:14 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes, not a skin test, as per my knowledge. A blood test. 

No, Skin prink test..

But I really don't know the deep details. I just asked my one student working in chugtai lab to give me all the details about tests.
12/01/2025, 1:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For fibre, things like oats, whole grains, lentils, beans are great. 

Then the usual fruits and vegetables are always super high in fibre.
12/01/2025, 1:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, based on my own personal experience, I’d suggest aiming for maintenance calories for now. 

It always takes me a month or so to figure food and all out so moving to maintenance for the time being helps manage stress and expectations. 

That doesn’t mean I don’t focus on other facets of health. 

I try to stay active, going on walks and all to explore the new city. Also keep a focus on protein even if it’s not perfect.
12/01/2025, 1:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Let me know once you have the details and I can guide you accordingly. 

Why do you want to get a test done though?
12/01/2025, 1:23 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Because of this, currently I'm facing flatulence (stomach gas and pain) after having protein rich food especially whey protein. @60193244266 because of this. <This message was edited>
12/01/2025, 1:31 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Same 🙋🏽‍♂️
12/01/2025, 1:32 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I am trying to increase fibre intake and focus on my gut health lets see
12/01/2025, 1:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just stop having any lactose for 2-3 weeks and see if you’re still facing these issues. 

If not, then you know that you are some level of lactose intolerant.
12/01/2025, 1:39 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Sure.
12/01/2025, 1:40 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Can it be because of more protein?
12/01/2025, 1:41 am - PF - Ali Hassan: People do get constipated when consuming whey protein regularly thats why everyone says drink lots of water
12/01/2025, 1:43 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I personally think it's because of dehydration like you said.

But mai bht doubtful ho gae hon for lactose thingy. I want to remove this doubt from my mind. bs isliye.
12/01/2025, 1:44 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Mind main stuck ho jata tbh mujy khud yahe weham lga hoa hai 👀
12/01/2025, 1:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Test it like I said. Best way to check it. No dairy at all for 3 weeks and then have 500ml of milk after that. 

You’ll pretty much know.
12/01/2025, 1:48 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Done! 👍
12/01/2025, 1:50 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Cheap n convenient way to check 💯
12/01/2025, 1:53 am - PF - Asma Tariq: One question:

Can I use lactose free milk for tea/coffee in these weeks? Or complete No to dairy?
12/01/2025, 11:29 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that should be fine
12/01/2025, 3:13 pm - You removed PF - Alizeh Malik / Habiba Malik (Bint Iqbal)

This week's check-in post is up - go share your wins and fails, no matter how small or big 🙏🏽

Looking forward to reading them at night ❤️
12/01/2025, 8:40 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Do you guys hate the fact that people pick up on you eating less on dawats and immediately ask: Are you on a diet?
12/01/2025, 8:49 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 🙋🏽‍♂️
12/01/2025, 8:50 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: How do you deal with it?
12/01/2025, 8:51 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I've been facing this kind of thing since childhood because of my food aversion and now adding to that is the calorie deficit.... I don't go to dawats where I am not comfortable 😂
12/01/2025, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s peoples’ own insecurities.
12/01/2025, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They can’t do what you’re doing and so feel like commenting on it.
12/01/2025, 8:53 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Actually saying Yes should be no problem
12/01/2025, 8:54 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: But agay se jawab aayega ya aa sakta hai kay koi fark tou nhi lug raha
12/01/2025, 8:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i just feel bad for them tbh !!
12/01/2025, 8:54 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yeah like dieting shouldn't be a taboo 😂 being fat and not doing something about it is more embarrassing for me 🤡
12/01/2025, 8:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s only till you make progress. Once you do then these same people ask you for tips.
12/01/2025, 8:55 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yes that is what I thought.. I mean I get embarrassed of taking picture of my plate which sucks. That feeeling sucks.
12/01/2025, 8:56 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Just ignore the negativity bro... Focus on ur end goal jb result nazar aye ga na inko to see how their perspective of u changes 😋
12/01/2025, 9:01 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: If I feel I don’t want to say yes I’m on a diet- I say I will take a second serving later. I don’t take it all together in order to avoid food wastage. (Which is actually kinda true) 

Sometimes I say yes I’m on a diet. Kal se hi shuru kari hai so they don’t get to say anything bad about how I look. 
But then they say itni patli hogayi ho aur mat karo kamzor hojaogi- so i reply acha ab nahi karungi 🤪 

Either way, people will never be happy with your response. It is how they are feeling from inside. A bad compliment is negativity inside of them- not you.
12/01/2025, 9:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: I personally don't anymore. I just say "oh, I caught a stomach bug and can't eat much" and move on!
They don't dare say anything.
It's better than explaining I have realized.
Unless someone wants to argue and fight.
Then I'm ready to throw hands.
Jk!
I'd still say something polite, feel sad for them, and move away from them.
Not worth my energy and definitely not worth my time, AT ALL!
Esp the family members who feel entitled to have an opinion on everything.
Those people can literally fck right off!
The solution I gave keeps such people away.
TRIED. AND. TESTED! :)
12/01/2025, 9:09 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Thanks @923005198888 and @923343773307
12/01/2025, 9:09 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: These would work in avoidance
12/01/2025, 9:11 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Roti vs rice which is more nutrient dense? Can we have rice everyday like roti?
12/01/2025, 9:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): definitely you can have it daily
12/01/2025, 9:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: You’re not exactly avoiding if you do what I suggested. You’re protecting your peace and calm, which is essential for your mental well-being. Research shows that people’s comments are often projections of their own insecurities or beliefs. Recognizing this can help you _depersonalize_ their words and respond without internalizing negativity- which is something we often end up doing unconsciously.

Setting boundaries- whether through humor, polite deflection, or firm statements- isn’t avoidance; it’s self-respect.

Reframing their comments as an opportunity to assert your choices can make you feel empowered rather than defensive- which is exactly what you want to achieve. The goal is to show that their words or opinions don’t hold any weight in your life. That’s hard, I know, because we’ve spent so much of our lives being hyperaware and hyperfixated on what people think or say about us. (story of most households, esp with parents, if not all!) But their opinions don’t define you- it’s about them, not you.

Finally, practicing self-compassion by treating yourself with kindness and mindfulness ensures you remain resilient and calm no matter what’s said. What you’re doing isn’t wrong or bad, even if they try to make you feel that way. That’s just their projection talking- and it’s hardly the full truth. 🤷🏽‍♂

Protecting your peace isn’t selfish; it’s self-care. It helps keep your emotional energy focused on what truly matters in life.

I hope this perspective helps not just you but everyone reading to rethink how they handle such situations. 🙏🏽
12/01/2025, 9:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: > What you’re doing isn’t wrong or bad, even if they try to make you feel that way.

And dieting or eating less especially in a social setting/dawat, isn't bad at all. It's your choice if you want to eat less or more. So yeah!
12/01/2025, 9:23 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yes. Sometimes truth is not always the right way
12/01/2025, 9:23 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Context matters
12/01/2025, 9:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Just be mahaaan dheet in front of them. 🙊

Dawat Kia, i do face it in my office. Madam bht health conscious hai, no bahar Ka Khana and all. Saab ghar se lati hain, even I brought my water bottle, Uni Cafe ki water bottles pe no trust.

 And know, What do I do?
Just Smile and ignore. And be dheeet. 😂😎
12/01/2025, 10:49 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: <Media omitted>
Is this correct? Esp peas? Steaming is better or cooking?
12/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 cup peas would be like 200g I think
12/01/2025, 10:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So then it’s right
12/01/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But calories bhi 200 almost hongi
13/01/2025, 1:46 am - You removed PF - Amna Junaid
13/01/2025, 11:23 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: https://www.instagram.com/share/p/BAawPYeTDs
13/01/2025, 11:26 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: My favorite one is

It's hard because it's unfamiliar, not because you're incapable.

So many of us are held back because we don't realize our full potential. I know I was one of them and I know I can still apply this mindset not just to health and fitness but other areas of my life too 🙌🏼 for example personal development (work life, life skills, relationships)
13/01/2025, 11:29 am - Taha Ahmed: And the same goes for the last two as well;
- Your direction is more important than the speed
- And that it only has to make sense to you
13/01/2025, 11:32 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Absolutely. I was just about to ask you about the last one.

Can we take it to mean that as long as we know what we are doing and we are seeing results (physically and mentally), we should disregard the mindless leg pulling and insensitive comments from people who are unconsciously projecting their own insecurities? 🤔
13/01/2025, 11:35 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Btw when I say what we are doing, I mean us particularly in this group (following a healthy and sustainable way)
13/01/2025, 1:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s about trusting the process and staying true to what works for you, especially when it aligns with your goals and values (something others may not see because of the lack of vision or perhaps, lack of clarity). At the same time, it’s natural to question yourself occasionally too, but that’s where self-awareness and trust play a huge role.

If what you’re doing feels sustainable, is yielding positive results (both mentally and physically), and doesn’t involve harm - either to yourself or others- then you’re likely on the right track. And yes, it’s equally important to block out negativity or unconstructive criticism from others who may not understand your journey (as long as it makes sense to you). Often, those comments are a reflection of their insecurities rather than a critique of your progress, like I said here yesterday.

That said, it’s always helpful to stay open to learning and adapting as you grow, something that makes sense to you right now may not work long-term. Personal development, much like health, is a continuous process of refinement, and just like coaching, the process never ends. There's always room for improvement.
13/01/2025, 7:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Done a workout while fasting. Energy is low.
13/01/2025, 7:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It was the upper body. I couldn't lift heavier
13/01/2025, 7:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s normal when fasting
13/01/2025, 7:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also , I can't do cable lateral raises. I can't even pull the first weight. So I'm doing dumbbell lateral raise. 3kg is I can do in less reps. Does that mean I'm weak in that muscle.
13/01/2025, 7:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): first weight of the cable stack is genrly 5kgs so thats more than your strength at the moment & cable offers more resistance too 
so if you can do it with 3kgs right now then thats fine you will build strength gradually
13/01/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Saadiah Vohra Qadir: What do you guys think about protein bars? Do they actually have as much protein as they claim?
13/01/2025, 9:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Some protein bars are the real deal, they're packed with actual protein powder and good for your gains. Then there are the imposters: granola bars in disguise, made of nuts, oats, dates, and a sugary syrup
13/01/2025, 9:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. If it’s a quality brand.
13/01/2025, 9:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah those aren’t protein bars.
13/01/2025, 9:14 pm - PF - Saadiah Vohra Qadir: What are some good brands
13/01/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Saadiah Vohra Qadir: That are available in Pakistan
13/01/2025, 9:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pakistan doesn’t have any protein bars brands
13/01/2025, 9:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But there’s one launching called baar.
13/01/2025, 9:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m testing it next week

13/01/2025, 10:00 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: lol
13/01/2025, 10:00 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: weird
13/01/2025, 10:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Product picture says 245 cals only. Nutrition table says 221. Picture says 18g protein table says 12
13/01/2025, 10:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah these are fine. Though 12g isn’t a protein bar for me lol
13/01/2025, 10:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: description: “whopping 18 grams of top quality protein”
13/01/2025, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be a red flag or could be a difference in flavor.
13/01/2025, 10:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 🚩
14/01/2025, 12:02 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: I feel better when I look at myself in the mirror
14/01/2025, 12:09 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Maybe its placebo but reps do make us feel better, right?
14/01/2025, 12:10 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Maybe you have actually improved n its not placebo but real progress n gains brother
14/01/2025, 1:15 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Hello, I have a nutrition related question, but it isn't about weight loss. I'm very new here, so I'm still figuring out the use of different spaces, apologies if this is the wrong space.
14/01/2025, 1:15 am - PF - Ali Hassan: This is the right space don't worry
14/01/2025, 1:16 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Question is about diet soda _ I know it is (almosg) zero calorie and generally aright to consume. What I wanted to ask is whether it gives energy rush like sugar does or doesn't?
14/01/2025, 1:17 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I've been feeling the same... I think my clothes are getting loose as well i can feel it
14/01/2025, 1:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. No calories so no energy coming in.
14/01/2025, 1:18 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Gud question 👌🏽
14/01/2025, 1:18 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Great, thanks
14/01/2025, 1:21 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Also, are there alternatives to caffeine for getting a boost?
14/01/2025, 1:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well, food is probably the best option because you get the most boost from energy and food is energy.
14/01/2025, 1:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Other than that caffeine can stimulate a similar effect
14/01/2025, 1:26 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Coffee has become an instant migraine trigger so trying to find something else that helps wake me up
14/01/2025, 3:01 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>

14/01/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Hey coaches! What do you think of ABC juice? ( apple, beetrot, carrot) 

I have been seeing alot of hype around it.
14/01/2025, 4:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: What about it?
14/01/2025, 4:54 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Asking about the benefits of its.
14/01/2025, 4:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is put together quite nicely
14/01/2025, 5:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: ABC can be a quick and effective way to get a dose of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It's often touted for improving skin health, 'detoxification', and boosting energy (due to its nutrient density and also calories, ofc). But the the thing is juicing process removes most of the fiber, which is crucial for digestion and blood sugar regulation (so not a good idea for diabetics) 

Also, since juice is more calorie-dense than whole fruits and vegetables, it’s easy to consume more calories and sugars without feeling full... fiber plays a key role in mitigating blood sugar spikes, so eating these ingredients whole or as a smoothie might be more beneficial for weight management and satiety. 

If you enjoy ABC or want to try the juice occasionally for its taste or convenience, it can fit into a balanced diet, but don’t rely solely on it for nutrients (a multivitamin pill can do it) or "detoxification", per se, as the body’s liver and kidneys handle that naturally. No foods or drinks or teas detoxify liver, blood, etc, that's all Bs.
14/01/2025, 5:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: What's the new hype about tho? I'm curious!

I've not come across this kinda content lately, so not sure!
14/01/2025, 5:04 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Just listening its good for the skin etc. thats why asking about it taha 👀
14/01/2025, 5:05 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: This answered my question, thanks :)
14/01/2025, 5:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I thought you’ve been listening to Hassan Azeem hahaha
14/01/2025, 5:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: Of course fruits and vegetables are good for skin, but mostly cause they're nutrient dense

But there's no one particular food that will do it, so focus on a variety of foods
14/01/2025, 5:07 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: I have to check him😂 
No idea who he is 
You make me unfollow so many content creators 😂 ( which is a plus ofcourse)
14/01/2025, 5:08 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Got it 😃
14/01/2025, 5:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ll need a security detail, the next time I visit Pakistan
14/01/2025, 5:11 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: 100 percent 😂
14/01/2025, 8:55 pm - PF - Amarah Khalid: I saw his vdo how to correctly eat boiled eggs.. lol lived my entire life not knowing there is a wrong way to eat boiled eggs🤦🏻‍♀️
14/01/2025, 9:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Internet is such a funny space
14/01/2025, 10:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I saw that too. He suggested adding them to lentils lol
14/01/2025, 10:09 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Btw I think most of the time hum humans ko simplicity hazam nahi hoti
14/01/2025, 10:09 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: like simplicity of counting calories
14/01/2025, 10:09 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: so we try to find other ways to prove ourselves wrong like how to eat boiled eggs correctly
14/01/2025, 11:23 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Guys made karri pakora today with no oil and air fried pakoray... This is the 1st time I am eating this after joining fomo

15/01/2025, 2:18 am - Taha Ahmed: 10k steps sirf weight loss ke liye he nahi, balkay overall health ke liye achay hain, including mental and emotional health
15/01/2025, 2:18 am - Taha Ahmed: So keep it up!
15/01/2025, 2:18 am - Taha Ahmed: And yes, wo exercises aap bhi karsakti hain. Agar koi limitation ho, jaisay ke koi exercise perform na horahi hai strength na honay ki wajah se tou aap message karke pooch sakti hai aur hum mai se koi coach aapko guide kardega <This message was edited>
15/01/2025, 2:26 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: I don't think age matters, your activity and fitness level matter. And 40s are not old. We pushed our mom to start gym 2 years back. She is 67. I checked the gym workout and my mom does almost everything apart from the pull ups. She also learnt to swim last year. And her health has improved so much.
15/01/2025, 2:26 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ji Alhamdullilah sach may walk krnay Sy Sara din active guzarta ha
15/01/2025, 2:26 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: But obviously she did it slow and steady with correct form and guidance.
15/01/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: I'm sure you will feel empowered to try everything on the plan soon :)
15/01/2025, 2:28 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): inshaAllah ☺️
15/01/2025, 2:39 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Sure... I tracked the dahi and besan for the curry then potatoes and besan for pakoray then the amount of light fry spray used
15/01/2025, 2:39 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Let me know if u need the screenshot
15/01/2025, 2:57 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Its hard for me to take my protein during fast in two meals . I snack too. But still not managing to go beyond 76 gram. Which makes me think Ramadan will be big struggle with protein.
15/01/2025, 2:58 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I had yogurt , chicken kebabs , eggs , protein yogurt . But it's so hard to eat after I break fast with a meal. I don't feel hungry later.
15/01/2025, 3:07 am - PF - Syra Hussain: Oh ok! I was just thinking if we cook it in more like a dish for more people how would i calculate that as it contains lots of water as well 

I assumed you calculated like that but you cooked it separately for you
15/01/2025, 3:22 am - PF - Ali Hassan: It was at least 4 portions
15/01/2025, 3:24 am - PF - Ali Hassan: So wat I did was weigh my portion and divide the total according to the ratio of besan and dahi aur oil to dala he ni na
15/01/2025, 3:24 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Woe portion fry pan main dal ky 1 tsp oil ka tarka lga lia bs 😂
15/01/2025, 3:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe just try to push this up by 10g. 

So 30g more chicken in a meal and done.
15/01/2025, 3:26 am - PF - Syra Hussain: Got it! Thanks
15/01/2025, 3:26 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Protein ko poora krnay k liye hum Kitna meat din may kha sktay hian
15/01/2025, 3:27 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Yani ager 90 gram protein Sirf eggs or meat Sy poora krna ho to
15/01/2025, 3:28 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sure . But suhoor is hard to wake up any way . Zabardasti khaa rhi hoti Hun . Iftar I eat like 40 to 50  gram protein.
15/01/2025, 3:28 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: This message was deleted
15/01/2025, 3:29 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Protein is more in the meals so carbs go low automatically. As I'm full with meat and yoghurt.
15/01/2025, 4:12 am - Taha Ahmed: 4 eggs
2 pieces bread 
300gm chicken breast
15/01/2025, 8:34 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): 4 eggs ko yolks k Saath?
15/01/2025, 8:35 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ux Sy calories or fat bhi to ziyada hota ha na
15/01/2025, 8:37 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): But if it fits within your daily caloric budget then it doesnt matter 
u can have 4 eggs
15/01/2025, 8:38 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ji theek ha
15/01/2025, 8:45 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Mujhay ayk question poochna tha k jb hum subah uthtay hian to Kiya breakfast jaldi kr Lena chahye
15/01/2025, 8:45 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ye hum jb tk full bhook na lgay tb tk breakfast na krian
15/01/2025, 8:46 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Or intermittent fasting healthy way ha kiya
15/01/2025, 10:43 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Breakfast aap tb krain jb aapko actually bhook lgy 
its absolutely not necessary to have your breakfast just because its morning unless you are feeling hungry
15/01/2025, 10:46 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if it suits your lifestyle and routine you can follow it but it doesnt offer anything more than jo ek normal calorie deficit ma na ho 
Smaller eating window might make you eat less but if you are not in a deficit and eating at maintainance or surplus then intermittent fasting won't help
15/01/2025, 11:27 am - PF - Farah Salman: If my protein goal is 90 to 100gm
But i take 120 to 130
Will it be harmful
15/01/2025, 11:27 am - PF - Farah Salman: ?
15/01/2025, 12:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Absolutely not
15/01/2025, 1:30 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I’ve been sick for the last 4-5 days and I have only done one thing which is to stay within the calories limit. No workout, no weight tracking. This week has been all about just making sure that I am still eating well and trying to sleep well.
15/01/2025, 1:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is honestly the best approach when you're not feeling your best- prioritizing rest and staying mindful of your food choices is a great way to maintain momentum without overexerting yourself. It’s impressive that you’re still making conscious choices, as this consistency builds long-term habits. That said, don’t hesitate to cut yourself some slack- your body heals faster when it’s not under extra mental or physical stress. Listen to your body, focus on recovery, and trust that this period of rest is just as important for your progress! Hope you feel better soon!
15/01/2025, 1:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: I am saying this because I've tried pushing through sickness many times thinking I’d bounce back faster, but it only led to burnout and a longer recovery time. But after everything I went through last year, I've started prioritizing my health first (that means adequate sleep, rest and recovery), the rest comes later i.e. fitness/physique goals, work, family, relationships, etc. So trust me when I say that rest is your best friend right now - it's years of mistakes that you can totally avoida!

We, as humans, have now developed a habit of rushing through everything, and sure, it has its time and place... but RIGHT NOW is not it!

And even if you're resting and not being 'productive' per se (working out, staying active), this community is for you to come back to and share your thoughts/feelings, so don't stop that. Reflecting, sharing your thoughts, or quiet journaling in this time can actually teach you a lot about your own patterns. And with this, you'll get our guidance and support and we'll hold you accountable! <This message was edited>
15/01/2025, 5:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's actually so true. The rush culture .. and constantly being productive is very very draining.. it gives a sense of control and value to one. I have this pattern of exerting myself through sickness ....
15/01/2025, 5:36 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I also wanted to ask . I have been watching dr. Eric Berg's videos for years . He is very strong on keto . That's the only advice I haven't followed. But does he talk sense ?
15/01/2025, 5:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Eric Berg is one of the top 3 🤡 in the nutrition world. 

He’s repeatedly called out and makes ridiculous, outlandish claims just to make money.
15/01/2025, 5:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: He’s also not qualified to talk about nutrition.
15/01/2025, 6:13 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Another dr ? 😂
15/01/2025, 6:14 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: He is a joron ka dard nikalanay wala Dr
15/01/2025, 6:15 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I can use that
15/01/2025, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Chiropractor hain.
15/01/2025, 6:40 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Removing the skin from KFC chicken will help reduce the calories? If yes, how much approximately?
15/01/2025, 6:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can track it as normal chicken then breast/wings/leg/thigh 
oil will reduce too kuch had tk
15/01/2025, 6:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Impossible to tell. And the skin is why I eat fried chicken hahaha
15/01/2025, 6:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Warna nandos kha loon 🤣
15/01/2025, 6:51 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I know it's the crunch which makes it 😋 tasty
15/01/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @60193244266 who are the other two? 🤔
15/01/2025, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Eric Berg
Glucose Goddess
Paul Saladino

And quite a few more. 

Including that black guy (forgot his name)
15/01/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Eddie Abbew?
15/01/2025, 9:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. That idiot.
15/01/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: 😂 😂
15/01/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAUZZ26SPLZ/?igsh=aHI0aDBydnNvZWs3

For anyone with children, THIS IS SO IMPORTANT!
15/01/2025, 9:21 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>

Dave Asspray
15/01/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My husband is very impressed with him.
15/01/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So dr. Berg . Seems like he has a lot of knowledge around herbal remedies
15/01/2025, 10:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But with nutrition is not good to listen ??? Because of him I did intermittent fasting for three years
15/01/2025, 10:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I lost weight but definitely with muscle. It was a rapid weight loss back in 2019
15/01/2025, 10:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. He’s an idiot when it comes to NUTRITION SPECIFICALLY. 

I don’t care about other fields but the guy is clueless on nutrition.
15/01/2025, 10:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And Eddie Abbew injected himself with all sorts of steroids for years and is out here preaching clean eating now. Like what?

So you can inject chemicals but can’t eat them?
15/01/2025, 10:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Has anyone tried this? 
Worth buying? Any suggestions.
15/01/2025, 10:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Beginning of 2024 I was also impressed with his knowledge. It was my former PT who made me aware of what's what where Eric Berg is concerned. So yeah, big no to taking any nutrition advice from people whose field is not related to nutrition. Also too many Chiropractors are well known for grifting
15/01/2025, 10:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Moka pot. I've tried the coffee at a friend's place. I'm planning on purchasing one soon
15/01/2025, 10:52 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: This reminds me of that podcast you had with Fahad. Where his pharmacist friend was on gear but stopping him from taking whey protein because "it ruins kidneys" 🤣 and then your clients vodka example 🤣
15/01/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923134867945 wait for a month or so. I'll give you my review
15/01/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: 😁
15/01/2025, 11:24 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I have used a version of this. Depends really on the coffee blend you are using. It brews great though.
15/01/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I might give you my review before it :p
16/01/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: One Pakistani coffer store provides very good blends. Grao coffee, a Karachi based store. <This message was edited>

16/01/2025, 1:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope.
16/01/2025, 1:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. We don’t strengthen our joints through walking and exercise
16/01/2025, 1:52 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thanks ..it just doesn't incline
16/01/2025, 1:52 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Like treadmills
16/01/2025, 12:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Doesn’t need to, to be honest.
16/01/2025, 2:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is that ok if I do bent over rows with one hand
16/01/2025, 2:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: <Media omitted>

16/01/2025, 2:51 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: Seated row machine is damaged.. what should i alternate with?
16/01/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can bentover dumbbell rows
16/01/2025, 2:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
16/01/2025, 3:34 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I feel wen i walk on treadmil on zero incline. I get knee pain
If i use incline then i feel better
16/01/2025, 4:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be a number of reasons for that
16/01/2025, 4:12 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Also wen i do squats or

16/01/2025, 4:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): cracking sound ?
16/01/2025, 4:12 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I've been working out with weights since manyy yrs now
Its not that ive just started
16/01/2025, 4:12 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Yes
16/01/2025, 4:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): so basically if it doesnt hurt then its fine 
We have fluid between joints called synovial fluid. When gas bubbles in that fluid burst you hear a cracking sound
16/01/2025, 4:15 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Okay
16/01/2025, 4:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Just like when we crack our knuckles.
16/01/2025, 6:28 pm - PF - Zuha Nasir: <Media omitted>

17/01/2025, 10:03 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Can I do incline bench press instead of incline machine press and hack squat machine isn’t available in our gym so suggest an alternate of this excerise also
17/01/2025, 10:05 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes you can do incline bench press instead of incline machine press but i would always prefer a machine press over a free weight press for so many reasons & if i dont have a machine press i would prefer smith machine incline press over a barbell incline press
17/01/2025, 10:06 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If you dont have Hack squats machine then you can do a smith machine squat
17/01/2025, 10:07 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I do high bar squat on smith machine is it fine?
17/01/2025, 10:22 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Because I don’t have a squat rack at gym
17/01/2025, 10:24 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it is fine 
If you look at the hack squat pattern your back is straight in that movement to load quads primarily. So when you will do smith machine squats to replace hack squat then try not push your glutes too far back so that your back is somehow straight n you can load the quads better
17/01/2025, 10:24 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
17/01/2025, 12:01 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: As I read in late middle age  
we need muscle recovery more (in term of days) so then in this scenario how can we do train per muscle two times?? Becz if I do two times Then i have only sunday for recovery..
17/01/2025, 12:10 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): a muscle recovers is around 36-48hrs after a workout session. lets say u trained chest on monday then you can train it again on thursday 

To recover a muscle properly your protein intake, sleep, overall nutrition, water intake all play a very important role so focus on all these things

If your workout are well programmed & you are doing good interms of the things which help with post workout recovery then you will be fine
17/01/2025, 12:31 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Thank you so much😊

18/01/2025, 12:24 am - Taha Ahmed: First thought that popped into my head: _*Loads of bullshit.*_
18/01/2025, 12:26 am - Taha Ahmed: Unless massaging your body with this oil magically puts you in a calorie deficit, there’s absolutely no way it’s going to lead to fat loss!!  
And don’t even get me started on how it claims to “fix” uric acid issues- let’s not go down that rabbit hole. 🙄 <This message was edited>

Why do hot and cold food have different weights on the scale ? For example main ne corn boil kiye scale py pare pare weight uper ja ra tha
18/01/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: What's the science behind this ? Condensation? 🤡😂
18/01/2025, 8:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): boil krny ma corn ny water soak kia hoga na bro
18/01/2025, 8:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No no. I know what he means. 

It’s just something that happens. Probably has to do with the steam and vibrations inside the food. 

Like molecular level pay.
18/01/2025, 10:45 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Yess thissss
18/01/2025, 11:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I got a UTI and I'm on strong antibiotics. My appetite is gone. All I can eat is tea and toast 🫤
18/01/2025, 11:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s understandable. Medication and also feeling under the weather can impact appetite. 

Try to eat what you can for now. Don’t focus on calories either. 

Focus is on recovery. 

I would encourage getting some protein in cause that can help fast track recovery.
18/01/2025, 11:25 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Get well soon ALLAH apko shifa de
18/01/2025, 11:30 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm on it for 7 days. I'm concerned. If I can't eat or workout at same pace.
18/01/2025, 11:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s fine. 7 days makes no difference. It’s like a deload.
18/01/2025, 11:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Ameen
18/01/2025, 11:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I will try .. I had boiled eggs and cooked chicken. But it was difficult to eat. 

Just a question. Is there a link between high protein diet making urine ph levels or high protein in urine? I need some light on it. Someone is telling me to be easy on protein. 

I was drinking less water lately it was really cold and I fasted as well.. I also have kidney stones.
18/01/2025, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you seen the doctor about the kidney stones?
18/01/2025, 11:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Protein has nitrogen and so can impact urea levels. 

But that’s not something to worry about of it self.
19/01/2025, 1:24 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes I'm under the care of urologist
19/01/2025, 1:25 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And also on the waiting list for removal surgery . It just takes too long on NHS

19/01/2025, 1:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: They used to import it so I’d assume so. But Pakistan hai. Can never be certain unfortunately
19/01/2025, 1:32 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I hate getting sick here 😭 its a nightmare
19/01/2025, 1:33 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was in the phase of motherhood of very young children. I was avoiding it myself tbh. But it needs to be treated. Now its a long wait.
19/01/2025, 1:33 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I had a similar issue in the past but wo stone medication se breakdown ho gya to it was really small... Should I be cautious? Boht purani baat hai but still scares  me islye main ne kbhi protein power ni use kia tha because of these myths linked with it

19/01/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: nope. Kidney stones aren’t because of protein otherwise every bodybuilder would have stones.
19/01/2025, 1:49 am - PF - Areena Qadeer Khan: Hey Sameet Alam Khan Taha Ahmed, after 3 days of workout and 35 minutes of treadmill my legs are killing me...what's the best way to alleviate the pain?
19/01/2025, 2:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You guys don’t come close to the in intake me and probably Ali has. 

I eat 175g daily. Have done so for over 10 years
19/01/2025, 2:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rest days and sleep.
19/01/2025, 2:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Soreness is usually only an issue when you start exercise for the first or really increase intensity suddenly or try a new movement. 

It takes about 4-5 days for it to settle down and then shouldn’t come back, at least not with the same intensity because your muscle would have gotten stronger. 

If it’s very painful and movement is an issue then you can take a pain killer but try not to overdo it.
19/01/2025, 3:34 am - PF - Ali Hassan: You guys are very fit and active 😭 on the other hand humne to boht zulm kia hai khud per
19/01/2025, 7:34 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yeah for past 5-6 years my protein intake is min. 170g per day even on days when i can't manage to eat much solid food i would simply have like 4 scoops whey n there was a time when i experimented n took it to 200-220g per day for like 5-6 months 
so yeah protein isnt what causes kidney stones
19/01/2025, 7:38 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Wese kitne scoops le skte hain in a day ? And how did u manage ur fiber intake ?
19/01/2025, 7:40 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): on days when solid food is an issue for me i take ispaghol for fiber & with whey there isnt like a limit k itny scoops ly skty hain is sy zada ma masla hoga
19/01/2025, 7:42 am - PF - Ali Hassan: So 2 scoops together is fine ?
19/01/2025, 7:42 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): absolutely one hundred percent
19/01/2025, 7:44 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Thank you 🙏🏽
19/01/2025, 7:45 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 2-2.5 scoops to ma daily leta hun almost
19/01/2025, 8:14 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coaches, I have a question regarding body measurements. So when we take our body parts measurements.Like if I am measuring my thigh so there is always the smallest measurement and largestt measurements like when in some part of thigh it gives smaller number and other gives slightly larger number so which one to take?
19/01/2025, 11:07 am - Taha Ahmed: Pick one area and stick to it when taking body measurements.
For example, if you’re measuring the upper thigh, make sure you measure the same spot every time for consistency.
19/01/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Should I flex the muscle at that time or not?
19/01/2025, 11:20 am - Taha Ahmed: You can but you have to, since we're just measuring body girth
19/01/2025, 11:39 am - Taha Ahmed: Don't have to*
19/01/2025, 11:57 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: so I was out with friends and family on a road trip since Friday and I had just no restriction time with them for 2 days
now we are going back and I am thinking of resuming the routine back
mentally- I feel fat and feel like I must have gained everything back
19/01/2025, 11:58 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): It must be water weight bro 
you cant lose all the progress in just 2 days. Chill kro just get back to routine n you will be fine
19/01/2025, 11:58 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: resuming from today* while we are going back home
19/01/2025, 11:59 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: how many calories would a cheese paratha of quetta hotel have? I ate two last night 😂😂😂
19/01/2025, 12:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 550-600ish because paglon ki tarah oil daalty hain pan py quetta waly
19/01/2025, 12:04 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: not bad
19/01/2025, 12:04 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: i must have ate at maintenance or slightly above it
19/01/2025, 12:04 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: over 2 days
19/01/2025, 12:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's a mental block many of us deal with, and it's completely normal

Now’s the time to connect with your inner self and remind yourself to trust the process. Even if the scale shows a few extra pounds, it’s likely just water weight- unless you’ve been eating 7700 calories daily over your maintenance (which I highly doubt!).

To break out of the spiral, try doing things differently:

1. Return to eating normally when you're back- don’t restrict, even if you’re tempted to
2. Exercise if you can- not to burn off imaginary gained fat, but to keep building strength and muscle
3. Focus on sleep and easing back into your routine (very important)
4. Don’t overthink or try to fix anything- just go with the flow.
5. Be kind to yourself- progress is never linear, and one off week doesn’t define your journey. I’m sure you know that no progress is ever made or lost in just a week.

Take it easy buddy, @923152068897! And have a great rest of the weekend! <This message was edited>
19/01/2025, 12:06 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Yes

19/01/2025, 8:48 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: usually in summers i got acne on my back and arms and in winter it disappears and whenever i see a doctor they advised to avoid eggs and meat. So are these food really causes acne?
(From last 4 months I am having eggs almost every day)
19/01/2025, 8:50 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I face this problem in every summer season. What is the main cause of this and what should I do for it?
19/01/2025, 8:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Summer is also when you sweat more. Which means your skin has more bacteria leading to acne.
19/01/2025, 8:52 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Are eggs or meat contribute to acne?
19/01/2025, 8:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Otherwise we’d all have acne.
20/01/2025, 12:52 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Can carbs and protein be converted into fats if consumed more than a daily limit like if my limit for carbs is 215g and protein is 120 so if I overeat this can they be converted into fats?
20/01/2025, 1:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Unless that excess intake puts you in a calorie surplus your body wont be adding any fat onto it 
Even in a surplus your body hates converting carbs into fat because your body always prefers those metabollic process which are energy efficient requires less energy n converting carbs to fats is not an energy efficient process. Even in surplus like 80% of the fat which body adds comes from dietary fat n very little from carbs unless you are insulin resistant or diabetic then the percentage of carbs to fats increases abit 
In a calorie deficit your body will never convert anything into fat rather will burn fat
20/01/2025, 1:05 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
20/01/2025, 2:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: If my fat intake is more within my calorie budget. But more than the mark I was given. Let's suppose I have 70g of fat but I was given only 53g . But I stayed within 1500 calories. Would that cause fat to be stored ? Or slow down the fat loss progress
20/01/2025, 2:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Most of my days my calories are low but fat goes up. As I eat avocado , dark chocolate butter, cheese. Not much but the mark goes up
20/01/2025, 2:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Same progress. Same results. Same everything.
20/01/2025, 4:24 pm - PF - Amna Awais: Men or women ko aik din main kitne gram fiber lena chahiye? Or fiber k sath water intake kitna hona chahiye?
20/01/2025, 4:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s 14-16g per 1000 calories. 

Water intake isn’t linked to fibre intake.

thankyou coaches 🥺

20/01/2025, 7:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes exactly if somebody is active, does workout & eats good nutritious food with good protein n fiber as per body's requirement isnt overweight or diabetic or insulin resistant then whats the point of reducing that blood sugar spike
20/01/2025, 7:35 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I'm not good either but i would be happy with any of the front two😄
20/01/2025, 8:29 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I have a question about frozen chicken items.are they as nutritious as fresh chicken?and can we include it in our daily diet?
20/01/2025, 8:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can include them but it shouldn’t make up the majority of your diet.
20/01/2025, 8:32 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Is there any harm taking it daily?
20/01/2025, 8:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really but like I said, it depends on your overall diet.
20/01/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Farah Salman: Frozen chicken?
20/01/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Farah Salman: We dont get fresh chicken daily
We get them once a month n freeze it
20/01/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Farah Salman: So technically we use frozen chicken on daily basis
20/01/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Farah Salman: 🤔
20/01/2025, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not frozen chicken. He meant things like nuggets and sausages.

Is this entry ok for egg whites 2
21/01/2025, 11:45 am - PF - Nida Umer: Hi
So i think i have like a span of 6 hrs of sleep
Question:
If i sleep at 10:30-11:00 i am usually up around like 4:30-5:00 and i am fresh and even have  some more time to sleep
But if i sleep at 11:30-12:00 ish
I am dying in the morning waking up by my alarm at 6:30

Its the same 6 hrs even more 
But why am i not fresh in the mornings n dreading to wake up
21/01/2025, 11:57 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): There is thing called circadian rythym which is like your body's internal clock so your internal clock might be more aligned with an earlier bedtime, making sleep quality better when you go to bed at 10:30–11:00.

If you sleep at 11:30–12:00 and wake up at 6:30, you may be disrupting the cycle which leaves you feeling kinda groggy even if you slept the same or slightly longer.

Try to sleep and wake at the same times every day to align your sleep cycles with your natural rhythm.
21/01/2025, 11:58 am - PF - Nida Umer: Omg wow 
No wonder i never liked science 😂🫣
21/01/2025, 12:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, what Ali said^. So for me, if I sleep early, let's say 12-1, I'd experience bad nightmares. I've realized it's cause I am not really tired when I sleep so during my light sleep, I experience these bad dreams. But if I sleep late, around 3-4 (which is my usual for over 5-6 years now), I sleep fine, I wake up refreshed and very rarely experience any grogginess. No matter when I sleep, I'm wired to wake up between 10-11am. If I sleep late and wake up at 11am, I am good. If I sleep early, I'd still wake up between 10-11am but the sleep won't be restful. 

So it's to do with sleep cycles and waking timing. Your body completes 90-minute cycles, and waking naturally aligns better with light sleep, leaving you refreshed. Sleeping late disrupts cycles, so you wake during deeper sleep, causing grogginess (literally what you mentioned)

But ye cheezain bohat individual hoti hain so what I am experiencing is something you may not! And what you're saying may not resonate with others. Haha
21/01/2025, 12:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it's better this way!
And egg whites entry look good too
21/01/2025, 12:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Science is fun & interesting 😄
21/01/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Farah Salman: @60193244266 are you satisfied with the ingredients and quality and macros of the protein bar by baar?
Usually locally made protein bars ya tu v high in cals hotay hain
Ya ghalat calculated hotay hain with not very nice ingredients
21/01/2025, 2:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’ve tried them too, and they’re pretty good! The calories and macros are almost spot on (Mustafa’s a friend of ours, and he’s also a fitness enthusiast). Plus, the ingredients are high-quality, which is already a win.

I loved the coconut lime flavor.... dark chocolate? not so much!
Oh!, and they taste nothing like the regular protein bars, and also don't have any after taste, which is amazing.
21/01/2025, 2:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If I could marry the coconut lime flavour. I would.
21/01/2025, 2:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Will try the dark chocolate tonight.
21/01/2025, 2:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha, same! And if I could, I'd have 2-3 of those bars everyday
21/01/2025, 2:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): As you guys are praising it so much i wana try it too now 
i hope they launch soon
21/01/2025, 2:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And they’re still high calorie-ish. 

19g should ideally be around 190-200 calories but this is 250. 

But the 50 extra calories are worth it for how good they taste.
21/01/2025, 2:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re launching soon but I think it’ll just be Karachi. 

Cause these aren’t standard protein bars. They need to stay refrigerated.
21/01/2025, 2:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yar malaysia bhej skty hain to islamabad bhi koshish krlain😄 <This message was edited>
21/01/2025, 2:14 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Almost a meal replacement then?
21/01/2025, 2:14 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Sounds interesting
21/01/2025, 2:15 pm - Taha Ahmed: The volume is way too less, so can't be a meal replacement. You'll want more food (high volume) to fill up your tummy.
It's a great snack tho. Good amount of protein and calories!
21/01/2025, 2:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Not a meal replacement at all. I had some daal and half a naan and at the end of it had this.
21/01/2025, 3:00 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hain. 🙄

I think I don't have any sleep cycle. Lol. I just go to sleep the moment I hit my pillow. 🙊 And kabhi Kabhi on my study table, I'm sleeping as well. Lol. 

Well, whether I sleep for a 4-5-6 hours or 8-10-11 hours. I never had nightmares ALHUMDOLILAH or sudden ankh khul gae and no nind, It rarely happens to me. 

It's something inherited I think, idk.  because, ALHUMDOLILAH no one has  sleep issues at my side.
21/01/2025, 3:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Lahore bhi. I really want to try it out. It looked so yummy.

What about body fat calculation by Meta AI? Kya ye correct hota hay?
21/01/2025, 6:12 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Or is there any other way to calculate body fat%?
21/01/2025, 6:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I dont think this is correct 
 body fat percentage k leay DEXA scan ya skinfold measurements waghera use hota hai

21/01/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Is there any truth to this
22/01/2025, 12:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: In going heavier in db weights gradually. But my small finger hurts. Always after db workout.
22/01/2025, 12:09 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is there something I'm doing wrong
22/01/2025, 12:57 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: @923333439883 the moron in the video is Dave Asspray. Please disregard what he says
22/01/2025, 1:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. If I ever see him. I’m punching those glasses. Hard.
22/01/2025, 1:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Man thinks he’s cyclops from X-men.
22/01/2025, 1:06 am - Taha Ahmed: Hmm, well it could be your grip, as how you hold the dumbbell, the placement of your fingers, and the intensity of your grip can all impact strain on smaller fingers. Mostly happens if the weight isn’t evenly distributed across your hand or if you’re overloading one side, it could cause discomfort. Another factor could be excessive pressure during certain movements, like DB chest press, which might transfer strain to the fingers. Try adjusting your grip to a neutral position, focus on even weight distribution, and avoid over-squeezing the handle and maybe lift smaller weights until you wrist gets stronger (it happened to me too when I tried lifting 55kg db once 😅 I over squeezed the db so much that it strained my finger)
22/01/2025, 1:07 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I remember seeing a wellness misinformation starter pack meme. One of the items was colored shades 🤣 and so far it has been holding true
22/01/2025, 1:07 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Well Im only lifting 7kg on bench press. And yes I did incline and flat bench press today. My small finger is swollen as well
22/01/2025, 1:08 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: In each hand. Which I thought I increased. Lol ! I started with 2 kg btw
22/01/2025, 1:08 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Last year
22/01/2025, 1:35 am - Taha Ahmed: Try adjusting your grip and ensuring you're not squeezing the handle too hard
22/01/2025, 1:35 am - Taha Ahmed: It shouldn't happen but if it is, then it's one of those things I mentioned above
22/01/2025, 1:36 am - Taha Ahmed: Give it a try and see if it helps
22/01/2025, 7:38 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Hi, hope all are fine. I want to know about Monk fruit Sweetener , doest it Good or Bad?
22/01/2025, 8:45 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its a zero calorie sweetener & ofcourse not bad 
But it has some aftertaste so thats a drawback i guess n probably expensive than other sweeteners too
22/01/2025, 8:52 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Please koi aysa sweetener bta dian Jo Pakistan may milta ho or after taste na ho ux ka kiu k tea without Suger peena bohat mushkil lgta ha
22/01/2025, 8:55 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i use candrel or sucral personally 
after experimenting i have figured that agar aap chai bnany k baad uper sy add kr rhy sweetener then it might not taste as good but agar bnaty huay add krdain then it will taste much much better almost no after taste
22/01/2025, 8:56 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Kiya candrel or sucral k side effects bhi hian
22/01/2025, 8:56 am - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Aysa ma ne suna ha
22/01/2025, 8:56 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Nope 
they are safe
22/01/2025, 8:57 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i made a reel on sweeteners specifically kuch time pehly

22/01/2025, 11:00 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: 1800 / kg 
Buy use 100times less than white sugar . I didn't use yet , one of my friend told me about the quantity.
22/01/2025, 11:16 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I am making shami kebab at home today from chicken breast. How much daal should I use in it. I don’t want it to be a high calorie.
22/01/2025, 11:16 am - Taha Ahmed: <Media omitted>
For someone who drinks 8 cups of tea or coffee a day and likes it sweetened, this definitely saves a ton of calories from sugar. Just thought I’d share that with you all!
22/01/2025, 11:17 am - Taha Ahmed: @923331377004 I shared this in the group earlier. These are the sweeteners I am currently using^
22/01/2025, 11:18 am - Taha Ahmed: Sucral has 200 tablets | 1tab = 1tsp sugar
If you use 1 tab for 1 cup of chai and drink 2 cups everyday, it'll last you 3 months atleast 
And it costs 450-500rs <This message was edited>
22/01/2025, 11:18 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Thanks a lot😊
22/01/2025, 11:22 am - Taha Ahmed: That's upto you!
If you don't want it to be high in calories, maybe make chapli kebabs instead (only meat and some veggies without daal) <This message was edited>
22/01/2025, 12:13 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: I make without daal  & the  taste is the same

However around like 4pm after work and having lunch i just wana sleep n feel extremely tired n sleepy 
Coffee is my only saving face

What am i doing wrong <This message was edited>
22/01/2025, 6:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nothing. It’s normal to feel sleepy after a meal. 

It’s called post prandial somnolence. 

Basically, your body is using more blood for digestion and therefore it’s normal to feel sleepy. 

You could reduce calories in lunch and see if that helps.
22/01/2025, 6:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Also are protein bars of clean proten recommended
22/01/2025, 6:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah they’re fine
22/01/2025, 9:40 pm - Taha Ahmed: I know I’ve been a little quiet here lately, and I wanted to share why. Today, I had the privilege of spending time with kids at an underprivileged school, teaching them about healthy eating, staying active, and how even small changes at home can make a big difference.

These kids come from such humble backgrounds that they’re actually paid to attend school, just so they have a chance to learn and grow (some of us can't even imagine what it must be like for these kids). Someone I know runs this incredible group of schools, and I jumped at the chance to volunteer.

It’s hard to put into words how much this meant to me. Seeing their curiosity and hearing their questions reminded me why making an impact at the root level matters so much. Sometimes, it’s not about fancy gyms or expensive diets, that's literally what we're all surrounded (yes, even going to a gym or being able to workout is a massive privilege we all have) - for me, it’s about helping people where they are with what they have, and unfortunately, some people don't have anything, at all...

This experience filled my heart in ways I can’t begin to explain, and it’s given me so much perspective. I promise I haven’t forgotten about this amazing community, you're all a part of the reason why I am out there trying to make a larger impact.

22/01/2025, 11:10 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Only if we were taught all this at an early age it would've made a huge difference
22/01/2025, 11:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It is really heart warming. As I remember in my childhood. This was taught to us. From then I had awareness but not much implementation. I have a very core memory about that chapter. It was given by some doctor. It's blurred. These little girls must be curious and excited to learn. jazakAllah for sharing your knowledge with these precious gems
23/01/2025, 1:02 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I will try it. I usually use it in after making tea.
23/01/2025, 1:11 am - PF - Asma Tariq: This reminds me of my school days as well. We also had a subject about food and nutrition but it's blurry now.

23/01/2025, 1:56 am - PF - Asma Tariq: It was government schooling and this one was a compulsory subject till eight standard. A bit of basic stitching and crafting bhi seekhatay thay ous mai. And We had foreign doctors sessions in our high school as awareness on health and food as well. I still  have some glimpses of them in my memory. 😊
23/01/2025, 1:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yup 💯 unke time py to private school ka concept ni tha... I hope somehow they bring this back, at least nutrition ky moamle main to humari country improve ho
23/01/2025, 2:01 am - PF - Asma Tariq: After 2000-2003, the public schooling system or secondary education system of Pakistan is in serious depression. Well long debate. Some other day. Lol.

23/01/2025, 4:28 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 1 lbs per week is a good enough weight loss goal, right?
23/01/2025, 4:51 pm - Taha Ahmed: There's no "good enough" weight loss number that you or anyone else MUST follow/target.

For most, 1lbs is doable but you could lean on either side, that is you could lose weight slower or faster, depending on how well you can stick to your plans, how much weight you need to lose, how sustainable it is, etc.

For some, it may be too much (those who've tried losing weight previously and failed each time)
For some, it may be just fine (given they can sustain it)
For some, it may be too slow (someone who's got hundreds of pounds to lose)
23/01/2025, 4:57 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Noted. So there’s no specific number to target.
23/01/2025, 4:57 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I think I am quite happy with the progress so far.
23/01/2025, 5:02 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Local made copies
23/01/2025, 9:53 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey coaches,

Is it normal, a weight is high on scale but your inches dropped. 

I was just tracking today after three weeks.  My weight is a bit high but inches are dropped (visibly)? Or I'm making some mistakes. Or the scale is out of order. 😳

I dropped it on FB. Could get an answer so asking here. Just em curious 🧐
23/01/2025, 9:54 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You are doing absolutely great n its normal
drop inches means you have lost fat
23/01/2025, 10:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: But why is my weight not dropping? I'm over weight. 

I want to see the scale going down.
23/01/2025, 10:04 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): scale weight is a combo of so many variables 
losing inches, getting stronger, eating good nutritious food, better relationship with food should always be the priority
23/01/2025, 10:06 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: U might be gaining muscle mass as well
23/01/2025, 10:07 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm not doing any workout abhi taak. Just walk and household chores.

If I start a 4-day home workout which I'm thinking of starting by today. Does it help in weight and strength?
23/01/2025, 10:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ofcourse it will help
23/01/2025, 10:11 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Thank you. 😊
24/01/2025, 1:16 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Please shed some light on  salt sprinkled on chips or salad. Is it true table salt is bad just like poison if you sprinkle on top of your egg, chips or salad. And it's better to cook it instead. 

And making a Celtic salt solution can be used as electrolyte if you do longer intermittent fasting.
24/01/2025, 1:22 am - Taha Ahmed: 1. There’s no evidence that sprinkling salt on food is harmful compared to cooking with it. Total salt intake matters, not the method of adding it (people on the internet have gone crazy tbh)

2. Also, celtic salt contains trace minerals like potassium and magnesium, which can help replenish electrolytes. If you’re fasting regularly and experiencing dehydration or muscle cramps, it can be a useful addition esp during fasting. But occasional fasting doesn’t usually require electrolyte supplementation and you can do without it as well, given you're not experience dehydration or muscle cramps

24/01/2025, 2:45 am - PF - Zeenat Sultana: What is 1RM ? Can everyone explain in a simple way? How it can help in weight lifting?
24/01/2025, 4:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 1 Rep Max. 

It’s basically the maximum amount of weight your can lift for one rep in a given exercise. 

And no, you don’t need to do it. In fact I’ve never ever done a 1RM set.
24/01/2025, 4:06 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Like heavy deadlift?
24/01/2025, 4:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.

24/01/2025, 9:26 am - PF - Saadiah Vohra Qadir: Every time i do hack squats, it leaves bruises on my shoulders and my knees ache. Other types of squats don’t cause knee pains. What am i doing wrong?
24/01/2025, 9:33 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): The machine’s shoulder pads might be pressing into your traps too hard or using too much weight could increase pressure on your shoulders, leading to bruising. This happens to me everytime i do hack squats or barbell squats 

Placing your feet too low on the platform increases the demand on your knees and can cause pain if you lack mobility.  Going too deep, especially if you lack mobility, can place stress on your knees. Limit your range of motion to a depth where you feel stable and pain-free & then gradually increase that range of motion. 

Ensure that you are pushing through your heels and not your toes. Pushing through toes increases stress on the knees.
24/01/2025, 10:29 am - PF - Saadiah Vohra Qadir: How can i ensure i am pushing through my heels and not the toes?
24/01/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Farah Salman: Usually, the day i work out, my muscles don't sore. 
Aisa lagta hi nai pooray day k workout kia tha.
Lekin, the next day when i wake up
My legs ,abs, arms, (whatever muscle was done a day before) are aching so much.
Why is it so?
24/01/2025, 12:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Soreness sets in after 24 goes or so. That’s normal
24/01/2025, 2:07 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I love this pain by the way. I don't feel that much anymore ...
24/01/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I love it too actually 
Jis din nai hota i feel sad that mybe my workout wasnt effective 😜
24/01/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: True
24/01/2025, 2:10 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): But 1 thing guys do not associate soreness with an effective workout
24/01/2025, 2:11 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I wanted to ask this
24/01/2025, 2:11 pm - PF - Farah Salman: If we r not sore or not feeling anything at all
Still, are our workouts good enough?
24/01/2025, 2:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes absolutely effectiveness of workouts isnt dependent upon being sore after a session.  
I dont get sore like may be once in 4-5 months & im sure @60193244266  bhi nhi hota hoga

24/01/2025, 2:19 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: This message was deleted
24/01/2025, 2:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yea exactly 
the only time i get sore is when i resume workouts like after a break or if my sleep/recovery is poor for a week or so else never get sore
24/01/2025, 2:39 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: I have a question! If we are doing like strength training for alot of time and with the time it seems easier for you like after 3 months then it means it becomes ineffective for you ? Or you should change something more in the workout?
24/01/2025, 2:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When things get easier then you just increase the weight you’re lifting. That’s how you keep progressing.
24/01/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Syra Hussain: Got it
24/01/2025, 3:32 pm - You added F - Ali Gul Pir
24/01/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): It's true k din k time Pani ziyada ziyada peena chahye or jesay sham ka time ho jaye to Pani km piyian werna kidneys pr bohat pressure hota ha
24/01/2025, 11:03 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 😮😳🙄
24/01/2025, 11:08 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Yess aysa mujhay Kisi doctor ne kha tha
24/01/2025, 11:09 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ab hmaray coaches hi btaian gy k ye sai ha ya nhi
24/01/2025, 11:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope.
25/01/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Raat k time pani peene sirf toilets visits barh jayenge
25/01/2025, 12:02 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Our kidneys work hard day and night .. il
25/01/2025, 12:09 am - PF - Marium Hamza: Ya and you might not be able to sleep well because of the bathroom trips.
25/01/2025, 12:46 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. This is why it’s said to have more water in the day.
25/01/2025, 12:54 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
@sameetalamkhan what's the difference between this and the blue version (whey blend)? 🤔
25/01/2025, 2:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is whey isolate (more filtered, lower lactose)

Blue one is a blend with mostly whey concentrate. 

If you’re not lactose intolerant then whey concentrate is fine.
25/01/2025, 11:26 am - PF - Farah Salman: There was a time when i used to enjoy HITT workouts with weights and also without weights
And used to follow many fitness youtubers and their workouts

But now i just can't/dont want to do uchhal kood
And like working out with weights only(no hitt)

Does it make any difference ?
25/01/2025, 11:27 am - PF - Farah Salman: I dont like running now

Just normal paced walk
25/01/2025, 11:27 am - PF - Farah Salman: Is this also ok ??
25/01/2025, 11:32 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its absolutely fine, preferences change. Strength training & getting stronger has more benefits to it than just doing HIIT. 
There was a time i used to do go to the gym twice a day for a cardio session in the morning and a workout session in the evening. 
Now i barely do any cardio just focusing on being more active with walk/steps
25/01/2025, 11:36 am - PF - Farah Salman: Is it becoz we were younger and had more energy?
25/01/2025, 11:39 am - PF - Nida Umer: <Media omitted>
25/01/2025, 11:39 am - PF - Nida Umer: Is this brand and type fine?
25/01/2025, 11:39 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes its a good brand
25/01/2025, 11:45 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it has less to do with the energy i personally think n more to do with the education and knowledge about training. You now know that how beneficial is strength training you must be seeing yourself getting better and you are enjoying it 
Social media has spread so much nonsense when it comes to losing weight/fat & HIIT/cardio is just one of those things. 
People mostly dont know how these things work n how to approach their goal interms of training, nutrition ka to or b bera ghark hua wa hai
25/01/2025, 3:28 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Aoa, i have recently joined fomo.I have a question related to calorie tracking.If we say we are taking 1 cup of cooked vegetable, does it means its equal to 250g?
25/01/2025, 3:36 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no 1 cup can vary so much depending upon the size of the cup
its better to weigh your food and track that way
25/01/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok
25/01/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is it true that omega 6 fatty acid if consumed a lot are inflammatory (like seed oils ) and omega 3 like butter oil , salmon fish and olive oil are anti inflammatory??
25/01/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: What is the right balance ?

25/01/2025, 6:21 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 My FOMO subscription for this month is going to expire in a couple of days.How can I extend it?
25/01/2025, 6:23 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DC9ytAJiu1O/?igsh=MWhjZmVicDB4Y2lqNQ==
25/01/2025, 6:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s auto subscription bro.
25/01/2025, 6:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t really need to worry about omega 6 intake in my opinion if your overall diet is good. 

There is some benefit in adding more omega 3s though.
25/01/2025, 6:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is spot on.
25/01/2025, 6:41 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: This message was deleted
26/01/2025, 7:16 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): If in plan one time is dumbell lateral and second is cable lateral if dont want to do cable lateral raises go for shoulder press or dumbell lateral?
26/01/2025, 7:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Either is fine.
26/01/2025, 7:40 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I usually workout in the morning, but tomorrow I'll be fasting. Should I adjust my workout schedule to after iftaar or is it okay to work out while fasting?
26/01/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can try it either way. No right or wrong approach.

Whatever works for you.
26/01/2025, 7:55 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Oky but I’ve hear somewhere that you must consume a high protein meal with in 2 hours after workout for muscle recovery.
26/01/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Hi. Have a question; i’ve been making my own meals for a while now (mostly some form of chicken with vegetables and rice, the meal trainers love to give 😊). I’m a bit bored now. 

Wondering if i do portion control instead. As in suppose qeema alo is made, I could weigh out my portion ? Or if karhai is made I could take out my chicken pieces and weigh them ? The only issue would be I dont know the amount of oil added so would have to guess that. 

My goal is fat loss but i’ve given myself the whole year, I dont have a specific target date to chase. 

This keeps things interesting but hopefully still under control ?
26/01/2025, 9:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This is what the coaches suggest here
26/01/2025, 9:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Track your food 
And share pictures of your food and your trackings to get coaches approval <This message was edited>
26/01/2025, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup, can most certainly do that too. 

Weigh it out. And then based on that we can estimate calories.
26/01/2025, 9:05 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Only issue would be the oil which cooks love to use.
26/01/2025, 9:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: We can estimate it.
27/01/2025, 12:29 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: B stance hip thrust i can’t do this exercise koi aur bata dy
27/01/2025, 12:29 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Lower back issues he
27/01/2025, 12:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Aap B-stance hip thrust ki jagah glute bridges ya bird dog exercise try kar sakti hain. Ye donon exercises lower back-friendly hain aur glute aur core strength improve karne mein help karaingi :)
27/01/2025, 1:04 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: My weight jumped 2 lbs today. Lol. In a day. I ate in a deficit but still jumped. I guess other reasons are involved.
27/01/2025, 1:13 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Hi 
If I can't complete my 10k steps then gym cardio machine can b substitute of those steps.. because I am highly active throughout the day..  like ghr k steps I don't count or I use stairs like 15 times too.
27/01/2025, 1:13 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: I go gym by walk so woh b 1.5 km hai
27/01/2025, 1:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you eat out? How was sleep? Stress?
27/01/2025, 1:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
27/01/2025, 1:20 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: No eat out
27/01/2025, 1:20 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Sleep is terrbile
27/01/2025, 1:20 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Thanks😊
27/01/2025, 1:20 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Changed some daily meds?? maybe causes water retention
27/01/2025, 1:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s your answer
27/01/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I don't understand why sleep has such a huge impact. If you are in deficit, you are in deficit :(
27/01/2025, 2:09 pm - Taha Ahmed: You're right. While being in a calorie deficit drives weight loss, poor sleep disrupts hunger hormones like ghrelin and leptin, leading to increased cravings and reduced satiety, making it harder to stick to your deficit 

Also, inadequate sleep impairs recovery and fat loss, favoring muscle loss instead

And if you're lakcing sleep, your body's under a lot of stress. And we know what happens then. We retain a lot of water due to increased/high stress hormone called cortisol
27/01/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Sleep affects your hormones and hormones literally drive your body. If your hormones are out of whack, your body stores and uses energy sources/ nutrition in a very different manner
27/01/2025, 2:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m more interested in knowing why you said this.
27/01/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I can't get more than 4, 5 hours sleep. And it is messing everything up :(
27/01/2025, 2:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why? What’s the reason behind it?
27/01/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Can i dcan i do goblet squat o no
27/01/2025, 2:31 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: 2 jobs with teams in carzy timezones, kids' school, chores
27/01/2025, 2:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Goblet squat is more quads than glutes.
27/01/2025, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But if you want to emphasize more quads then sure.
27/01/2025, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah that sounds tough. Can you maybe aim for minimum 6 hours. 

I’d recommend making a log of your time and see where you can save time from
27/01/2025, 2:34 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Yeah, I know I need to fix it
27/01/2025, 2:35 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: My sleep time is taken by the me-time after the kids sleep. TV shows.
27/01/2025, 2:36 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Need to fix it
27/01/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Farah Salman: I dont know what's happening since 2 days.
Im not unwell, alhamdulillah. 
But workout k time, i feel so weak 
Kal tu kia hi nai gaya. I took an extra rest day.
Aaj 10 mins se ziada nai hua .
Weights utha k weakness horae hai.
I'm not new in strength training been doing since quite a few yrs now
Alhamdulillah 

Dont know what phase is this
27/01/2025, 3:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be your menstrual cycle? Could be sleep or could just be that you need a deload.
27/01/2025, 3:16 pm - PF - Farah Salman: So giving body a break is ok?
Ya should i push myself
27/01/2025, 3:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can lower the intensity & volume abit  for a week or so there is no issue in doing that
27/01/2025, 3:36 pm - PF - Asifa Mir: Alternativa db rdl exercise
27/01/2025, 3:38 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: How many hours of sleep minimum shall we aim for per day?
27/01/2025, 3:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Leg curls.
27/01/2025, 3:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well, ideal is 7-9 hours.
27/01/2025, 3:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah like Ali suggested, you can reduce intensity and volume or even if you take 4-5 days off. That’s not an issue. And then start a new cycle of training.
27/01/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I get 7.5hrs.is that alrigh?
27/01/2025, 3:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. That’s decent
27/01/2025, 10:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: I know life’s been a rollercoaster, and we’re all juggling a ton right now. But I want us to take a moment to reflect- how have the past two weeks been for you? Wins, losses, whatever- it all matters.

28/01/2025, 10:25 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Can I do machine fly instead of DB fly? In DB fly i can’t lift more weight.
28/01/2025, 10:36 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, you can switch to the machine fly, but keep in mind that if you can't lift more weight in the dumbbell fly with proper form, the limitation might be due to a lack of strength. Focus on building strength gradually with lighter weights and controlled form. If your goal is to lift more weight, the machine fly is a good alternative while working on strength development
28/01/2025, 10:39 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: If we have machines available for a particular excercises so should we opt for machine or free weights?
28/01/2025, 10:42 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Machines have an edge over free weights as they are more stable and you can lift more on machines than free weights 
Personally i would prefer machines over free weights but that doesnt mean you shouldnt be using free weights
28/01/2025, 10:45 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, so this is a personal preference, right? @923441183411 
For instance, I prefer using free weights because I feel more in control of my movements, and it allows me to develop stability and engage more stabilizer muscles. It also helps with building functional strength, which translates better to real-life activities. But of course, both free weights and machines have their place depending on the goal and individual preference!
28/01/2025, 10:50 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yea it is personal preferance & also the fact what exactly you want to achieve, what is your training goal and then you structure the training accordingly 
but yeah there should be a mix of both machines and free weights in your training program
28/01/2025, 10:52 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Hello, if you have atleast 20 kg to lose whats a better approach; diet and cardio (walk) or diet, strenght training and walk?

I do weights for my mental health more than anythibg else, its the only one hour to myself. But i feel like the weight might come off faster if i ditched the weights for now and then added them once i’ve reached a certain goal weight ? <This message was edited>
28/01/2025, 10:59 am - Taha Ahmed: If you have 20 kgs to lose, remember that fat loss comes primarily from creating a calorie deficit through your food intake (your diet). Since 1 kg of fat contains about 7,700 calories, 20 kg equals 154,000 calories.

Scenario 1: Lose 20 kg in 6 months

Weekly calorie deficit needed: ~5,916 calories
Daily calorie deficit needed : ~845-900 calories

Might be a bit too much? You'd know how well you can stick to this!

Scenario 2: Lose 20 kg in 12 months

Weekly calorie deficit needed: ~2,958 calories
Daily calorie deficit needed: ~422-500 calories

This seems more sustainable because the deficit isn't too big, you'd be able to eat a good amount of food and not feel deprived.

Now these deficits can be achieved through a combination of reduced calorie intake and increased activity.

Now about exercise, strength training builds muscle mass, which raises your BMR, meaning you burn more calories even at rest. Walking and cardio can burn calories in the short term, but they don't significantly increase BMR like muscle-building activities do. Strength training also improves body composition and helps prevent muscle loss during fat loss, which is key for sustainable progress. You also look better naked because you have muscles to show for that lean and toned look you might be wanting.

Ultimately, I think, it's better to stick with strength training if it’s good for your mental health and makes you feel stronger- it really is a long-term investment in your health and overall wellbeing. Focus on fat loss through diet, use walking or cardio to stay active, and let strength training support your mental well-being and metabolic health.

P.S. You could ditch the weights, but then you might be putting yourself at risk of losing muscle mass while you lose fat.
28/01/2025, 11:01 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 👍
28/01/2025, 11:02 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I’m not ditching my weights. Love the feel good effect too much !
28/01/2025, 11:20 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
@923343773307 what’s your take on this?
28/01/2025, 11:24 am - Taha Ahmed: Could you clarify what exactly you’d like my take on? Is it the validity of the claim, how it applies to your goals, or perhaps how to incorporate running into your routine effectively?
28/01/2025, 11:30 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Validity of the claim and also How can I add running into my routine for better health.
28/01/2025, 11:36 am - Taha Ahmed: Haha he's one of the top scientists in this field so I am sure what he's saying has some truth to it. 
But if you go and read the post, he mentions this "While the findings are interesting, it's important to note the limitations of using leukocyte telomere length as a biomarker for aging"

It's just one individual study showing these results and has lots of limitations, so perhaps more evidence is warranted before making any conclusion!

And, you can add cardio in your routine however you want. Maybe 15-mins everyday or three 25-mins session a week. Up to you!
28/01/2025, 11:41 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
28/01/2025, 11:41 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You want to lose 20kgs? 😳
28/01/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: In an idea world yes !
28/01/2025, 11:43 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You don’t have 20kgs to lose
28/01/2025, 11:43 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What’s your current weight?
28/01/2025, 11:44 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And answer me this, how does your life change after losing 20kgs? 

What do you think is going to happen with that specific number?
28/01/2025, 11:45 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Good question
28/01/2025, 11:46 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Ok suppose i lost 10 kg and i lost fat and gained muscle and everyone said i look great and i felt great, it would make me v happy right. So if i can lose a bit more than that then why not ?
28/01/2025, 11:47 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I am 84, this cant be a good weight. Should be atleast 70.
28/01/2025, 12:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but 20kg is a massive goal. So maybe first target getting under 80kg for now.
28/01/2025, 12:07 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Ofcourse. Me and my massive goals
28/01/2025, 12:10 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Make us happier?
28/01/2025, 12:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is such an important insight to unpack!!
28/01/2025, 12:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: Attaching self-worth to a specific number on the scale can create a cycle of fleeting happiness and long-term anxiety. I've done too when I first started and I was forced to change my mindset years later because I was literally killing myself dieting and working out excessively... and here's why it does that!
Your weight fluctuates daily based on factors like water retention, hormones, stress, and even how much you ate or exercised that day. Fixating on the scale can make these natural changes feel like *personal failures*, even when you're making progress in other meaningful ways like gaining strength, improving health, or feeling more energetic

When self-worth hinges on the scale, it becomes a moving target. Let’s say you hit your goal weight and let's say that's 70 kg- what happens next? Will the number feel *"enough,"* or will it shift to 68 kg, then 65 kg or maybe 60? True confidence and happiness come from focusing on how you feel, function, and live, rather than chasing a number
28/01/2025, 12:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: A sustainable, long-term mindset is about building habits and progress you can maintain for life, not just until the scale reads a certain way - if it motivates you to keep going then I am all up for it, but don't rely on it so heavily :)
28/01/2025, 12:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Body weight is just one metric. And your True *worth* isn’t defined by a number but by how you show up for yourself every day
28/01/2025, 12:19 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: I feel I’d be able to breathe right if I lose 20kg. It is more relief than happiness. I remember when I was 18kg lighter which was 7-8 years ago. I felt lighter. I feel I was able to DO more. Lift heavy groceries without hurting myself. Never get a porter at the airport. I had to wheel in 85kg heavy luggage at Heathrow this past summer and ended up with a bruise on my arm and out of breath. I did not like that. I want to be able to DO stuff again. I don’t like the laziness in my bones. It gives me anxiety.
28/01/2025, 12:20 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: You can be strong and have good stamina at a higher weight too. You were younger 8 years ago, your body was different.
28/01/2025, 12:20 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Unfortunately 
For so long
I have tied my happiness to weight
And yes it did lead to anxiety and body image issues

Buttt i am still fixated on losing weight
And cant seem to stay on track
28/01/2025, 12:20 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: That’s true. I didn’t think of that.
28/01/2025, 12:21 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I was 5-6 kgs lighter
And doing Amazing at the gym

I feel like a dadi ama now
28/01/2025, 12:23 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: My dadi was pretty cool so I’d take that any day. I WISH I would be like my dadi
28/01/2025, 12:23 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: 8 years ago I was 35. I will be 43 this year. I feel absolute age also matters with where it takes your weight
28/01/2025, 12:24 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: For some of us hormones hit hard
28/01/2025, 12:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I see my saas mA and i feel more aged then her
28/01/2025, 12:26 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: I gained 8 kg in a MONTH last year February without having changed a thing. Still struggling to get rid of that. Let alone the preceding 10kg
28/01/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I was 75 or 73 ten years ago. I knew weight was creeping up and should start doing something about it. Then my daughter got sick. To the extent she was left permanently disabled. The weight started going up. I lived on ready meals in the hospital abroad and no movement. I reached 80 and still going. Thats when i joined a gym and started weights for the first time, because people would see us amd they wouldnt comment about my daughter but they would say how bad they felt for me having gained so much.
28/01/2025, 12:43 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: So this weight reminds me of a time when my life was not in my control. Allahamdullilah i’m in so much of a better place now. I’m fit and active and strong, but still i feel being significantly less would make me feel so much better.
28/01/2025, 12:44 pm - PF - Nida Umer: So sorry to hear about your daughter
28/01/2025, 12:44 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: She’s a happy bunny now and i always tell my trainer i have to be strong enough to lift her always
28/01/2025, 12:45 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: I’m so sorry you had to go through so much but I hope you see and value your body for having protected its systems and your LIFE when they felt threatened. All of that stress ended up with just weight gain. Instead, please allow yourself to see your weight as a sign of resilience you needed at the time.
28/01/2025, 12:46 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: The human body is amazing and will hold on to weight for varying reasons. Not just excessive nutrition. It’s stress , its sleeplessness, its anxiety. So much more.
28/01/2025, 12:47 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: MashaAllah
28/01/2025, 12:47 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Absolutely
28/01/2025, 1:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly this. What you’re discribing is being more fit than just being a lower weight.
28/01/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol, why that emoji? I think I need to lose 25 kg. 
I was in my best health when I was between 55 to 60 kgs. Ran a couple of 5k marathons in London.  Felt strong, had more agility, boxed.
28/01/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: But then again, it may just be that I was still in my 20s and had no kids and quarter of the responsibilities.
28/01/2025, 1:31 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes, life weighs you down. But grateful to be able to move and lift. And honestly every time i move a notch up in the gym, or someone i look up to as being fit compliments my strenght it gives me as much joy as the scale going down.
28/01/2025, 1:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly that. Different phase of life. 

More time to focus on yourself.
28/01/2025, 1:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
I always knew saving this would come in handy.
28/01/2025, 1:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: After all the shit I went through last year and all the years before that, this is who I aspire to be now- fit, effortlessly. 💪🏽
28/01/2025, 1:45 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But would you be happy like this ? Fit but not “showing” it ?
28/01/2025, 1:50 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: I look like this. I'm a very obviously overweight woman and, most days, I'm not bothered by how I look. I want to get fit, not slim. Our bodies are vessels for us to have experiences through. Society has indoctrinated us into thinking we need to fit into aesthetic standards (that are also constantly changing). It takes intentional work to undo that, but it's possible <This message was edited>
28/01/2025, 1:52 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: I know women in larger bodies who have great stamina and are strong. That's what I aspire to
28/01/2025, 1:54 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Love and strength to both your happy bunny and you :) she will thrive by the virtue of having such a strong mom
28/01/2025, 1:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: That’s a valid question, and honestly, it depends on what “happy” means to you. For me, after everything I’ve been through, I’ve learned that how I feel- strong, capable, energetic- iz so much more important than whether or not it “shows” outwardly. I've won mr karachi in 2016 and have had chiseled abs, but it wasn't sustainable for me.

The truth is that I’ve been in places where my body looked “fit,” but I wasn’t okay mentally or emotionally such as when I competed. I’ve also faced comments about my weight that could’ve hurt deeply if I hadn’t worked on my body image issues (esp when I went upto 95kg last year after my surgeries). So now, I aspire to a version of “fit” that’s sustainable and meaningful to me: one where I can do what I love effortlessly and feel good about myself regardless of external validation while ensuring that I'm staying healthy (eating good, exercising moderately, getting my blood markers done to keep in the safe zone due to my health issues)

It’s a personal journey for everyone, but I believe happiness comes from embracing your body for what it can do, not just how it looks. I spent almost over 10 years working against it, since 2009 till 2020, but its not worth it!
28/01/2025, 1:58 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Personally speaking, I am not sure. The worst instance of fat shaming i have experienced happened when I was 15 kgs below the weight i am now. I was 64 - 65. Still 10 kgs over the ideal, i guess. But since then, weight has become my own mental centre of all public interactions. I have hit a lit of professional and personal goals over these years but haven't been able to enjoy the cause my weight becomes the centre of each moment.Sad but true, at this point in time at least.
28/01/2025, 2:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I look fit, at least for most people but I’d exchange it for this in an instant. 

This shit is amazing. 

A very few can do this shit. 

Anybody can get lean but this is years and years of hard work.
28/01/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I guess we all have our own ideals. I would look at u and admire all the dedication, also years of it. Yet i am so grateful that inspite of being the heaviest sibling I have no health issues Allahamdullilah. My gym loving brother has back issues, my skinniest sister cannot do anything without an injury and my older sis needs a hip replacement eventually  . So Allah ka shukar for health !
28/01/2025, 2:15 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Yea I have a similar history. At my thinnest, I was keeping the weight off because I was doing hard drugs, barely eating, and exercising too intensely and too often. I was always injured in some way or the other and my sciatica was unbearable. And I was very very unhappy. Also, ironically, I hated how I looked.

Now I'm grateful to my body because it allows me to do the work that brings me meaning. Getting fit, for me, is about reciprocating that compassion so that my body is able to do what it does for me with more ease
28/01/2025, 2:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: You will gain even more strength mentally and physically both. Give yourself grace to be with your daughter when she needs you the most. You been an amazing mum and she will remember that.
28/01/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: I had a conversation with Taha and it was so eye opening for me. That even the fittest person might have insecurities. 
That being a certain weight does not determine your happiness. It will come from within. 

Also, I can’t compare to who I was 10 years back (when I think i might be at the ‘perfect’ weight) There were way less responsibilities on me. 
So its kinda stupid to compare yourself to when you were in your teens and were not a parent or a caregiver or were a student and not working. 

I was being too hard on myself. But now I’m appreciative of myself and my body. 

There is no harm in being a work in progress. Actually, having a goal drives you. But it shouldn’t overtake your life. 

My goal has changed from losing weight and yo yo dieting all year long- to being strong enough to look cool in tiktok videos of my 16 year old niece where I can lift her up easily 🤗

I looove running. And there is always room for improvement there. My goal was to do 5km under 30 minutes, which I achieved some months back. Now the goal is sub 25. Still not there but hopefully in sometime 🫡

I think it’s great to have goals. Not just a number on scale, but something to look forward to.
28/01/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: My goal for this year is to be able to do all the jumping/ running/ twisting that kids do in this soft play entertainment park  HarbourLand. We work a couple of months in Thailand every year and that's the kids go to place, I am not mobile enough to do all that they'd like to do with me.
28/01/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: So I've been doing mobility routines, knee, and hip mobility stuff.
28/01/2025, 3:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: This embracing journey is a very difficult one
28/01/2025, 3:02 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I feel u
28/01/2025, 3:07 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Very inspirational to read all the above guys

28/01/2025, 3:21 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I m estimating my meals and I have not done any workout
28/01/2025, 3:22 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Guys i wont add into the above conversation but i definitely want to say that you guys are absolute legends & after reading what you guys are going throught individually yet doing so well when it comes to focusing on your health is inspirational
28/01/2025, 3:22 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: So if I go workout today at home . But split it .
28/01/2025, 3:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Like not do altogether but whenever I can. Would it still count.
28/01/2025, 3:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes it will absolutely count. 
Something is better than nothing

Is this true
29/01/2025, 5:58 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Is there any side effects of dexa scan if we want to do it just to know our body composition?
29/01/2025, 7:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): there isnt any
29/01/2025, 7:17 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Last week I was going to it just to know my body composition but there is person in the lab he saib don’t do it without any reason this rays are not good for your body🤔
29/01/2025, 7:18 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @923441183411What do you suggest? Should I do it just to know my body composition?
29/01/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): did you ask why is it not good or what are the potential side effects ?
29/01/2025, 7:19 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I'm sure the guy would have no idea what DEXA stands for even <This message was edited>
29/01/2025, 7:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): its absolutely safe & krwa skty ho aap
29/01/2025, 7:20 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok

29/01/2025, 7:22 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And dexa scan ke elwa dosra koi method hay body composition janny ka?
29/01/2025, 7:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): DEXA is like the gold standard
29/01/2025, 7:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): why ?
29/01/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Usne Dexa scan ke itne side effects bataye ke Dar gaya may.
He said it’s equal to 200 xrays aur ye rays harmful hai and it’s cancer causing etc
29/01/2025, 7:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Well thats not true at all n as i said earlier the guy had no idea what he was talking about 
x-rays used in DEXA are normally 1/10th the intensity of a normal chest x-ray
29/01/2025, 7:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How is this guy working in a hospital
29/01/2025, 7:38 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): maybe kursi py betha hoga uthny ka dil nhi hoga or ye wala manjan baich dia 😂
29/01/2025, 7:39 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: 😅😂😂 unke pas Dexa ki facility nai thi shyad isi liye bol diya

29/01/2025, 7:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Bro along with expertise in nutrition & training, i have MS in Robotics & intelligent machines with majors/thesis in Medical robotics i have done alot of reseach on medical equipments devices etc. DEXA was one of the devices 
So i can assure you its safe. If you want to get it done then you can proceed with it
29/01/2025, 7:45 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Thank you🙏
29/01/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: If you’re on deficit, is feeling hungry sometime normal? Even when you’re having high volume high protein foods. 

Also, sometimes it feels im not really hungry, but I want to eat. Like my stomach is full, i had a good meal earlier, I slept well last night, i don’t think I’m under a lot of stress, my period isn’t nearby and Ive had enough water too but I just want to eat. Like my mouth is bored? More like psychological hunger instead of physical hunger. If that makes sense 🙈 
Im not bored, I have work to do too. I feel full too.
29/01/2025, 8:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes, some hunger is normal and accepting that can make your journey easier
29/01/2025, 8:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes, psychological hunger is a thing. Especially if you’ve built that habit. 

A lot of people look to food out of boredom
29/01/2025, 8:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: So how do we stop snacking?
29/01/2025, 8:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: 😆
29/01/2025, 8:38 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: my problem is hunger a few hrs after having a meal
29/01/2025, 9:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Diet soda works for me
29/01/2025, 9:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or doing some other activity so you aren’t bored

30/01/2025, 6:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. I trust Baar but it has higher calories and is priced accordingly too.

30/01/2025, 7:08 pm - PF - Farah Salman: There was this page..i dont remember the name . Locally produced bars.
Chocolate and peanuts protein bar
I orderd .
It tasted good
But then there were toooooo many peanuts in one bar
I picked them all out
And measured ..they were wayyyy more than worth of 200 calories
I wonder poora bar mai kitni cals hungi. 
And they miguided us by mentioning 200cals fr the whole bar
30/01/2025, 7:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol. Not surprised
31/01/2025, 11:14 am - PF - Farah Salman: When in deficit
I feel too low for extra activity like NEAT and cant complete my steps

When i push myself, i end up eating more calories 

What is this😢
31/01/2025, 11:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Life 🤣
31/01/2025, 11:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: But this is where things like high volume foods can at times help to combat hunger
31/01/2025, 11:38 am - PF - Farah Salman: Its mostly about energy levels
Not hunger as such (i guess🤔)
31/01/2025, 11:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Does this happen every day or just on certain days? It’d be interesting to see your food intake on those days to figure out what’s going on- maybe it’s something in your food choices.
31/01/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Assalamualaikum 
Mujhay aap Sy poochna tha k kuch din Sy Mera blood pressure high ho rha ha bohatt ziyada nhi but jesay aj Meri tabiyat khrab hoi ma ne chek Kiya to 140/91 tha ma ne breakfast may 2 boil eggs liye thy ayk egg yolk k Saath or ayk egg sir white part Saath may ayk cup tea sucral ki tablet daal k li to 5 minutes Baad hi mujhay BP high feel honay lga
31/01/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ab pta nhi ye sucral use krnay Sy to nhi ho gya ma ne life may first time start Kiya ha
31/01/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): <Media omitted>
31/01/2025, 2:03 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Please guide kr dian
31/01/2025, 2:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Wallaikum Assalam! Pehle tou ye jaan lena zaroori hai ke eggs ya sucral directly blood pressure spike nahi kartay. Sucral (sucralose) non-nutritive sweetener hai jo insulin ya BP pe koi direct effect nahi karta. Eggs bhi naturally BP raise nahi kartay, jab tak ke overall diet aur lifestyle factors controlled hon

Lekin jo aap keh rahi hain, uss se lagta hai ke blood pressure ka sudden barhna kisi aur wajah se ho sakta hai- it could be stress stress, anxiety, hydration, ya even lack of sleep. Aksar dafa, jab hum naya khaana ya ingredient try kartay hain, tou sirf anticipation ya worry bhi body response trigger kar sakti hai.

Agar aapko lagta hai ke yeh frequently ho raha hai, toh aap hydration check karein- pani kum tou nahi pi rahi? Salt intake dekhein ke kahin zyada salty food toh nahi liya? Stress levels note karein ke kya aap stress/anxiety mehsoos kar rahi thi khaanay se pehlay ya kal raat ya is subah? BP multiple times check karein (kabhi kabhi ek reading misleading ho sakti hai).

Agar BP consistently high reh raha hai, tou laazmi hai ke kisi achay doctor se consult karain. But for now, relax, deep breathing karain aur stress manage karain.
31/01/2025, 2:35 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ji theek ha ma chek rkhti hou regular bs need bhi poori ha or Pani bhi Koshish krti hou k 12 glass zroor pi lou bs diet may masla LG rha ha subah breakfast late ho jata ha or shaid apni required calories Sy km Sy rhi hou

31/01/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Mera weight 96 kg tha Jo 4 months may 84 tk aya ha
31/01/2025, 2:38 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Ma sucral continue rkhou kiu k ux ka tast bhi tea may bohatt acha ha
31/01/2025, 2:39 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): ?
31/01/2025, 2:56 pm - PF - Marium Hamza: Im not an expert on this, lekin kabhi eggs increase karne ke sath aap uske upar salt bhi ziada hi daal rahi hogi, usse hosakta hai fark para ho. 
Ya diet mai hum salads banate hain lekin uske upar masale ya ziada daalte hain for taste.
Yeh aapke blood pressure ko barha sakta hai I think.
Just suggesting, if coaches approve.
31/01/2025, 3:00 pm - PF - Asifa Adnan (Abdulmoiz): Wesay me kbhi bhi salt nhi dalti eggs pr na kbhi salad pr eggs pr Sirf black paper or salad or Sirf lemon kiu k mujhay ye hi pta tha k weight loss may salt ziyada use nhi krtay to ma ne bohat time Sy chorha huwa ha

31/01/2025, 7:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's the weekend and it's really difficult to get hold of a doctor

31/01/2025, 11:23 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Working out in my last pregnancy was one of the best things i have done. From 3rd month till the end, i felt active, i did’nt overly gain and best thing was I bounced back immediately.
31/01/2025, 11:24 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Fortunately more people seem to be accepting the benefits of working out during pregnancy versus just lying on your back.
01/02/2025, 2:45 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Manytimes i forget to take multivitamin and fish oil after breakfast so can i take them in evening somedays?

01/02/2025, 8:39 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Good morning. Quick question: does incline walking at medium speed really help to burn fat ? I see so many posts and people advising it. 15 min of incline walk at 12-15 incline and 3 mph speed ?
01/02/2025, 8:41 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: We have a house in abbottabad which is on a hill. And whenever we go there we do this walk everyday, i’ve named it the fat burning walk (just as a joke). We dont get 10k steps, we just do this walk up and down maybe 40 minutes everyday, and yet i always feel it makes the weight go down much faster than a regular walk…
01/02/2025, 8:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes
01/02/2025, 8:52 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Burning fat is different & losing fat is different. 
Whenever you are doing some low to moderate intensity activity your body primarily uses stored fat as energy but that doesnt mean you are losing fat too because for that you need to be in a calorie deficit 
So now coming to your point that you think you lose weight faster with incline walk than normal walk is because yes incline walk will require a greater energy expenditure than a normal walk if done for the same amount of time jo probably apka deficit thora increase kr raha ho but if you are doing regular for lets say 50min n you burn for example 200 calories n if you do 30min incline walk which also burns 200 calories keeping rest of the things similar then apka fatloss bhi similar hoga. I hope this makes sense

So all what matters is staying active training with weights & being in a calorie deficit if you want to lose fat
01/02/2025, 8:56 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Got it. Thanks.
01/02/2025, 9:29 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Looking for an easy to make dessert option - preferably something I can switch the sugar out w dates - possibly low cal?
01/02/2025, 9:47 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: My husband has been talking about getting a weighing machine that calculates BMI and estimates visceral fat. I'm thinking of getting one for him. Can I get any brand recommendations?
01/02/2025, 9:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: None of those are accurate btw.
01/02/2025, 9:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can’t track visceral fat like that unfortunately
01/02/2025, 9:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: They can help give an idea of changes over time though
01/02/2025, 9:49 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Yeah I know. But he has been wanting one for ages so why not. He is  muxh more disciplined with his fitness than I am :)
01/02/2025, 9:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What options do you have

01/02/2025, 9:56 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: I dony know actually some of the options are less than 5k and some are over 100k. All claim to measure the same elements

01/02/2025, 9:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, go with what’s in your budget since none of them are accurate so it won’t make a massive difference. <This message was edited>
01/02/2025, 10:04 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Our gym has a weird looking one in which you have to hold a bar while standing on the scale. I dont see anything like that on the websites though
01/02/2025, 10:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah those are slightly professional ones and usually cost upwards of 400k
01/02/2025, 10:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Equally inaccurate though
01/02/2025, 10:37 am - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol.so better 4k than 400
01/02/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I’ve seem a few options at springs if you are in karachi.

01/02/2025, 3:19 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coaches,My father has been battling diabetes for nearly a decade.i am looking for an online diabetes reversalable program for him to help him manage his diabetes. I want to know that
Do you people  offer online coaching For diabetic people specially or know  any of reputable programs that can provide personalized guidance and support for diabetes reversal and weight management?"
01/02/2025, 3:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: We don’t cure or reverse diabetes here, but what we do focus on is improving the key lifestyle factors that play a massive role in managing it- things like eating habits and nutritional intake, exercise, sleep, stress, and even supplements where needed. Over time, these changes can have a real impact on blood sugar control, overall health, and even medication dependence in some cases

If your goal is to help him improve his health and manage diabetes better, we can absolutely guide you both in the right direction (towards improving lifestyle factors), but I'd suggest also speaking to an endocrinologist (diabetologist) if you've not already
01/02/2025, 3:38 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: He is 56 years old,over weight and also have Arthritis due to which he is unable to exercise and his life style is also sedentary and a disturb sleep cycle. From last 3 years he is having medications for diabetes and also injecting insuline but the Maine problem is his diet and lifestyle which I want him to improve+ he smokes as well.
Recently I’ve heard about Dr.Waseem’s online diabetes reveres able program. How would you rate that program is that good?
01/02/2025, 3:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Anything by Dr. Waseem is BS for me.
01/02/2025, 3:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): a guy came to me after ruining his health by working with Dr. Waseem 
His kidneys got damaged so a huge NO
01/02/2025, 3:52 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I second Sameet.
I joined his program for weight loss and better health. Paid a heavy amount. Their junior coach will contact you. They will give you a diet plan which will be on deficit if you want weight loss but zero learning/knowledge and you will be restricted to the portions. Subho 3 eggs while and one whole egg ka omelette.

Ended up like a big disappointment. 🙊 

I followed that plan for at least one week maximum. <This message was edited>
01/02/2025, 3:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: And look where the universe sent you now 🫣
01/02/2025, 3:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes, I'm thankful for that. 

I always prefer knowledge, learning and empowerment. Even in food choices. Lol.
01/02/2025, 3:57 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: They recommend you to buy their own brand / PR protein powder and stuff. So you know better.
01/02/2025, 3:57 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Before joining Fomo I contact his team and want to enroll in their weight loss program but then luckily I started following @60193244266 on instagram and from then my view about health and fitness changed. His(dr waseem) team keep on contacting me then and also offer me a huge discount from 45k to 25k but I denied😅
01/02/2025, 4:00 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yeah that, true I asked them before joining that I would not use their multivitamin and don’t need any diet plan I want them to just help me in training and nutrition.But they say you must have to use that supplements and follow a 3 months diet plan
01/02/2025, 4:04 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: They were contacting me for a long time. I blocked them. lol.

I was following Sameet for a long time. One day I saw his reel. Then watched all the stuff. I did a bit of research and then suddenly I decided to join them on my birthday Heheheh 

But yes, here is my experience 👍 Sustainable, empowered with my choices and yes, learning. 🙂
01/02/2025, 4:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That price reduction is a red flag in itself.
01/02/2025, 4:08 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 your instagram content has helped me a lot in Changing my mindset. Thank you so much❤️

01/02/2025, 4:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): God knows whats in those supplements because everyone who has approached me till date after taking those supplements has seen a huge downfall im his/her health. Multiple complications
01/02/2025, 4:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I forced to buy one box for Bcaa's  from them which was added to my plan. Cost me Rs. 10000-15000. But ALHUMDOLILAH disappointment k sath i never opened it. 
Yeh 2-3 Saal phelay ki baat hai. It's all their Marketing and podcast things with islamic touch :) <This message was edited>
01/02/2025, 4:41 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): and Guess what you dont even need BCAAs if you are consuming your daily protein from variety of sources like chicken beef fish eggs greek yogurt etc.
01/02/2025, 4:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: No Protein intake instructions. Just follow the plan. (:
01/02/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is it true . If I drink chai after my meals ..the nutritional absorption will be less. Or is it a myth. I have a habit of tea with breakfast .  Someone told me iron absorption will be disrupted because of caffeine
01/02/2025, 4:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I have always done that even after that advice.
01/02/2025, 4:55 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes iron absorption thori c km hoti hai temporarily but thats not something to worry about too much if you are having well rounded meals like having enough fruits veggies protein etc.
01/02/2025, 4:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, but mostly the iron that's coming from plant based foods and the effect is minimal (nothing to worry about)

People on the internet exaggerate these things a lot
01/02/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I love my tea with Breakfast. I tried not to have it a few times but it was always on my mind
01/02/2025, 4:58 pm - Taha Ahmed: I have tea after my meals only and never had any blood related issues
01/02/2025, 4:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Do not torture yourself by not having it if you love it
Chai is not just a drink its an emotion a feeling😄
01/02/2025, 4:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's only recently that I've developed normocytic anaemia, but that's due to my cancer, hormonal issues and TRT 

Not tea 😅

01/02/2025, 5:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: First time: 22
Second time: last year at 29
01/02/2025, 5:01 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: True that

01/02/2025, 5:01 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Did the doctor tell any cause ?? Or prevention of cancer . It's in the hands of Allah... But I have a family history of cancer and I'm always worried
01/02/2025, 5:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: 22 is too young 😢
01/02/2025, 5:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: Being worried is the biggest cause, by that I mean stress, anxiety, etc

You can't know these things and there's really no actual reason why it happens 

It's said to be the food we eat, lack of physical activity, the environment we're in, people were surrounded by, anything toxic whether that's people, food, relationships, family, work, etc) <This message was edited>
01/02/2025, 5:03 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sorry ... If I'm being personal. It can be triggering.
01/02/2025, 5:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: I've talked about this on my IG, to spread awareness
01/02/2025, 5:05 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I'm in a toxic breeding environment 😆🤭 lol ... Everyone has stress and anxiety
01/02/2025, 5:05 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I agree. The biggest cause is stress. I have seen some very close family members who have gone thru v stressful times and soon after been diagnosed.
01/02/2025, 5:05 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's just not in ones control
01/02/2025, 5:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: I lost my mother to cancer and she never smoked or drank or anything 

Just the environment is fucked up, sadly! 🤷🏽‍♂️

We're constantly under stress, and our nervous systems are all wrecked, always in fight or flight mode and rarely in rest or recovery 

It's why it's important to regulate our nervous system daily/frequently, so that we're able to move between the windows of tolerance and switch back n forth between sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system and NOT STAY STUCK in fight or flight 

This is another reason why many of us have body pains, joint pains, health issues, unexplained migraines, gut issues, autoimmune, etc
01/02/2025, 5:15 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: True. But difficult
01/02/2025, 5:19 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: Man

01/02/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: Allhamdulillah
01/02/2025, 5:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: You were only 22 . Must be less stress. Stress comes with age relationships and work. At that age the only stress is to look good ..
01/02/2025, 5:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Haha nope. I have been a conscious kid all my life, and feel quite deeply. Unfortunately due to some early experiences, I never got to have a teenage life like kids generally do and grew up quite fast (mentally and emotionally)

So I have been stressed and have lived with trauma since I was 11 and it's showing up in different ways now
01/02/2025, 5:28 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: May you find ease now and know that we all look up to you.
01/02/2025, 5:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: Too kind. Appreciate that! ❤️🙏🏽🌻
01/02/2025, 5:30 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Stress has nothing to do with age. Nowadays, kids are more traumatized.
01/02/2025, 5:30 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: Ermm. I don’t think so

01/02/2025, 5:36 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: And for these coaches who we love !

01/02/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I have always felt the opposite. The younger you are, the less ability you have to take control. Barely any agency or resources.
01/02/2025, 5:40 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: The older you get, yes there are more responsibilities but also more resources, more freedom, more experience.
01/02/2025, 5:40 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Childhood / teenage traumas are so much more difficult to heal from
01/02/2025, 5:59 pm - PF - Muhammad Taha: yes

01/02/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: True - specially with diabetes because their bodies are literally fighting against them. There’s a French researcher by the name of glucose goddess that has great educational content around sugar intake and has these easy “hacks” that focus on managing glucose spikes.
01/02/2025, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: She’s an idiot but her content can be (at times) helpful if you HAVE diabetes.
01/02/2025, 10:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And she’s a biochemist. Not a researcher.
01/02/2025, 10:52 pm - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): For increasing strength and power what exercises to focus on and does stretching and mobility is good and beneficial?
01/02/2025, 10:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: All strength training exercises will do those things.
02/02/2025, 3:46 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: She’s said some stupid things about some conditions that I have myself - but like you said for people with diabetes like my mom I’ve seen a lot of her “hacks” help. <This message was edited>
02/02/2025, 4:06 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah the problem is she recommends it to everyone.
02/02/2025, 4:16 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Everyone’s selling something right
02/02/2025, 4:16 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: We should all practice conscious consumerism
02/02/2025, 1:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: You're right, we should- but if there's barely any awareness or literacy around this, how do you even begin to discern what's right or wrong and be conscious about it? 🤷🏽‍♂

Someone who doesn’t know much- if they see these big influencers talking nonsense-  they’re not gonna think it’s nonsense. They’ll think, "Oh, this must be true!" because millions are following them. And then they’ll start following that advice too 🙃

02/02/2025, 1:50 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: How do we know which form of exercise suits us?Either its pilates, yoga, strength training or anything else?
02/02/2025, 1:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: The one you enjoy, can stay consistent with, and aligns with your goals. If you want to build strength and muscle, strength training is ideal. For flexibility and mindfulness, yoga works well. If you're looking for core strength and controlled movement, Pilates is great. And if you love variety, mixing different forms keeps things fun and engaging.

Try different workouts, listen to your body, and see what makes you feel strong. Some days, you might prefer one thing; other days, you might want to try everything- because it’s fun and because you can. There’s no single "right" way to move; it’s entirely about what makes you feel strong, happy, and motivated to keep going!
02/02/2025, 4:02 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Two topics more add in it perimenopausal and menopausal .. becz after this ladies face more difficulties in weight reduction because of low oestrogen.
02/02/2025, 4:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Will build that too.
02/02/2025, 4:04 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Thanks.
02/02/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Plus their muscles and bones got so weak, because they don't focus on hormonal changes and required nutrition at that time. Mothers take this change so light but it requires serious attention.
02/02/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Very true.
02/02/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Protein intake is non existent
02/02/2025, 5:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s also this belief that our standard desi diet that’s cooked at home is healthy. 

It’s not. Our parents don’t realize that hygiene and healthy/ nutritious are two very different often unrelated things.
02/02/2025, 5:22 pm - PF - Zeenat Sultana: Yahan tou kisi ko b keh do 4,5 eggs kahaya kro tou aak bara sa muu khul jata hai🤣🤦‍♀️ 4,5 aanday😱

02/02/2025, 5:23 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Do understand that this is not just discussing another generation. Perimenopause can begin any time after 35 in women of colour. Also the understanding and mere acknowledgement of the existence of perimenopause is very recent. At the time of MY mother and grandmothers this was not even known let alone the knowledge of nutritional requirement being common.
02/02/2025, 5:24 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 110% right. 

Our parents take so little protein. Just carbs. Even maintenance  calories bhi puri nhe letay.
02/02/2025, 5:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Only yesterday someone was asking me what to do for her since she’s experiencing hairfall in early 30s. 

Someone recommended biotin. Someone gave her multivitamins. 

After some interrogation, I found out she barely gets 15g of protein per day. 

My answer: You can try everything and anything but the root cause is lack of protein and till you rectify that, hairfall isn’t stopping. 

I get comments for my hair routine. The only routine I have is nailing protein intake for years lol
02/02/2025, 5:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Every person in a desi house hold thinks that us jesi healthy nutrition to kisi ki hai e nhi "ma roti khata hun doodh peta hun nuts bhi hafty ma 2 baar gosht bhi sabzian bhi khaany k baad fruits bhi anda kbhi kbhi q us sy cholesterol high hota hai" thats what you will hear from every desi person 
or phir jb metabolic syndromes sy health tabah hoti then they say pta ni kesy hogya ye ma to meetga khaata e nhi
02/02/2025, 5:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: True 👌🏻
02/02/2025, 5:26 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Having said that even as we speak this is a non exact science and has so many facets that are constantly being researched and information about it being updated. So there is plenty that we don’t know currently and our next generation will be better equipped to handle only because of the time newer knowledge comes to light.
02/02/2025, 5:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s an ongoing area of research but we have a lot more information available now. And it’s growing.
02/02/2025, 5:27 pm - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Absolutely. Which is why we will be on a better tangent than those before us but it truly is t their fault that they knew less about perimenopause when even now most doctors globally do t recognise it
02/02/2025, 6:07 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Lentils are a very good source of protein but i think unmai calories b kafi hain.Can anybody guide me abt calories in lentils and haleem kind of things?
02/02/2025, 6:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Agreed. But it’s their fault to an extent that they aren’t willing to change and learn. 

At least in my experience, the difficulty I’ve always faced with that generation is a refusal to believe younger people. 

And then will trust WhatsApps. 

My mom does believe me lol
02/02/2025, 6:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can track it on MyFitnessPal and you’ll get the macros.
02/02/2025, 7:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's been a stressful week . We all got sick in the house one after another. My son got a really high fever and infection. 

It's been 9 days since I haven't been doing any workout or tracking my food. No steps . I have been home. Trying to have my protein here and there when I get a chance. There are no changes in the weight. It's still the same. I am but worried about losing muscles .
02/02/2025, 7:09 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also , I'm thinking my strength will be lost too. As I am finding it hard to even carry my son right now. He feels heavy. I'm 80% recovered but getting tired easily.
02/02/2025, 7:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You won’t lose anything in 9 days. 

Focus on getting better and once you get back to routine, you’ll see nothing happened. 

You’re feeling weak because you’re still not fully recovered and likely undereating too. 

It’s normal.
02/02/2025, 8:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sameet is absolutely right- you won’t lose muscle or strength in just 9 days. What you’re experiencing is more about fatigue from illness, lack of movement, and possibly undereating rather than actual muscle loss.

Your body has been using more energy to fight off the infection, and since you haven’t been eating or moving as usual, your muscles might feel temporarily weaker. But once you get back to your routine, your strength will return faster than you think.
02/02/2025, 8:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: You haven’t lost progress and won't likely lose anything; your body is just asking for some extra care right now. 💙
02/02/2025, 8:25 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thanks @60193244266 @923343773307 @923441183411 

For replying with such warmth ... The worries really surround me when I'm home and not moving and going outside. 

My 4 year old boy. He has not been eating anything. I'm giving him diralyte forcefully. Because I had another hospital visit last night due to his dehydration yesterday. His throat is so inflamed that he can't even drink water.
02/02/2025, 8:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not my area of expertise but have you tried soups or yakhni? Something warm sometimes feel better on the throat but then again with a 4 year old it’s very difficult. 

Insh’Allah he recovers quickly.
02/02/2025, 8:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i hope he recovers really soon

"But, initially, the man said he experienced weight loss, increased energy, and mental clarity"

I mean how could he lose any weight if the surplus was that big! 😧
03/02/2025, 11:20 am - Taha Ahmed: This wasn't exactly Keto diet - it was carnivore diet which included excess amounts of fat

This is what my nutritional averages were for last week - considering supplements but the nutrition isle at the grocery store is a scary place and idk what to get.
04/02/2025, 2:34 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Hi I had a question.. I recently had my blood work done and doc said your sodium levels are low.. and it can cause water retention.. I am unable to make sense of this.. she didn’t explain anything… can one of the coaches explain this?
04/02/2025, 2:37 am - Taha Ahmed: Hey yes, it can. It's called hyponatremia. When sodium levels drop too low, the body tries to maintain balance by holding onto more water (less water excretion through urine), which can cause swelling (edema) in muscles or a feeling of puffiness (usually shows up under the eyes or face). 

This happens because sodium plays a key role in fluid balance, and when it's low, the kidneys may not be able to regulate water properly. <This message was edited>
04/02/2025, 2:40 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: What should i do to make it better..
04/02/2025, 2:40 am - Taha Ahmed: It looks good and we'll help you improve on it.

And you don't need any supplements per se. 
The ones that can actually benefit are Vit-D and omega-3 (fish oil) and maybe protein powder if you're unable to fulfil your protein needs through wholefoods (can be a quick, easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake)
04/02/2025, 2:41 am - PF - Amarah Khalid: Thanks for the explanation Taha.. plz let me know if there are any changes i should make to my dietary input to make jt better?
04/02/2025, 2:43 am - Taha Ahmed: Ask your doctor for more details, cause this can happen because of excessive water intake, or medications, or some other health condition which is unknown at this point.

You may need to adjust your diet or fluid intake.
Some quick things you can do right now;
1. eat more of eggs, dairy, seafood and lightly salted homecooked foods
2. monitor water intake - drinking too much water without enough sodium can dilute levels - aim for a balance (if you're sweating a lot then maybe add some electrolytes in your water or drink Gatorade like sports drinks)
3. electrolyte-rich foods can help too -like broth, nuts, seeds, etc 

But ask your doctor as well, koi medication ki wajah se na horaha ho!!
04/02/2025, 2:45 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I was at the mall and got roped into these “health” shots 💉- I know I know - but I got B-12, B Complex, and Vit D. 
B12 and Vit D because my bloodwork showed they’re low and doc prescribed pills which I never take. B Complex cuz ami na kaha acha hota hai but I genuinely don’t know what it does. I have 3 more prepaid rounds - so if I’m doing those once a week I shouldn’t worry about daily supplements na?
04/02/2025, 2:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, if you're taking these then you don't need to worry much about other supps. Just have more fruits and vegetables, eggs, dairy, nuts and seeds, etc., and you'll be good!
Later you can see if you want to add Vit-D and Omega-3 too

04/02/2025, 2:55 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is there a possibility of making low intensity workout routine for Ramadan . ? And how can we make changes in current programs ? If fasting 2 sets are enough ?
04/02/2025, 3:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If you plan on working out before aftaari then yeah you can drop some intensity its fine i workout before aftari n i have never dropped intensity but it can vary from person to person 
 if working out aftaari k baad then as such zarurat nhi intensity drop krny ki
04/02/2025, 3:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you are asking about 2 sets of an exercise or 2 sets in a whole session ?
04/02/2025, 3:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ll upload a maintenance workout (low volume) for people who want to switch to that style.
04/02/2025, 3:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: 2 sets of each exercise
04/02/2025, 3:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes its fine if you are training close to failure but it also depends upon your overall workout structure as well

05/02/2025, 7:31 am - PF - Muhammad Taha: STK-20250205-WA0003.webp (file attached)
05/02/2025, 7:31 am - PF - Muhammad Taha: Never had such craving
05/02/2025, 8:16 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Eat it. But then move on. Dont dwell on it or feel like damn, i ruined my whole diet.
05/02/2025, 10:20 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Normal to have these cravings.
In those days, I usually take ice cream within 250-350 calories or the count which suits the target.
You are feeling like having a tube but two/three scoops will fulfil you. Just enjoy it and move on. 🙂
05/02/2025, 11:22 am - Taha Ahmed: You know, whenever I have that overwhelming urge to eat a whole tub of ice cream, I take a moment to pause and ask myself: what exactly am I feeding?

Is it just my love for ice cream- the creamy texture, the perfect blend of sweetness and coldness melting on my tongue? Or is it something deeper?

I think of cravings like messages from my body and mind, but sometimes, they speak in a language I need to decode. When I was a kid, food was more than just food- it was comfort, a distraction, sometimes even a shield. If I was sad, lonely, or just overwhelmed, sweets were the easiest escape. I wasn’t eating ice cream- I was swallowing my feelings, one spoonful at a time. Sometimes my parents would get mad at me and to make up for me and show me they care, they'd offer sweets and I'd be a happy kid again. 

So now, when the craving hits, I check in with myself: Am I bored? Stressed? Am I looking for something to make me feel better because I don’t want to sit with my emotions? Am I seeking that fleeting moment of pleasure to fill a gap I don’t want to acknowledge?

Sometimes, I realize I just really want ice cream- and that’s okay. I eat however much I want- sometimes it's just a scoop or two and sometimes more. Depending on what I want. Other times, I recognize that what I truly need isn’t sugar, but rest, connection, or even just a deep breath to sit with whatever I’m feeling.

So, I try to make a conscious choice. Do I enjoy the ice cream mindfully, knowing it’s a treat, not an escape? Or do I find another way to meet the need I’ve uncovered? Either way, it’s about awareness- because when I know why I’m eating, I get to choose, rather than letting old habits choose for me.

I hope this helps everyone here make more conscious choices and not always give in to cravings -because cravings aren't just us wanting something, often times it's something deeper! :)
05/02/2025, 12:38 pm - PF - Sakina Zainab: question -
I've been consistent with my 3 day workouts lately. but after every leg/squat day workout my thighs cramp up and go really stiff for days. like i have trouble functioning after that. walking down the stairs holding my son. bending down to sit. or just getting up after sitting for a while hurts. 
i do manage to push through and finish my reps, it doesnt feel so bad in that moment. 
is it because of a longer gap since its a 3 day workout? how do i fix this?

Make sure you are eating enough protein & sleeping enough to recover properly

Then I worked on those underlying causes one by one and then I was amazed one day to find myself actually measuring out the chips in grams to either enjoy them with a meal or as a snack. It was a delight to find myself being able to make a conscious choice rather than letting old habits choose for me.

06/02/2025, 5:40 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was thinking after infection i will have less strength. But surprisingly, I  Increased the weight and was performing better than before.
06/02/2025, 5:41 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I completed this week's workout . My body was sore for two days. I rested yesterday. But strength is much more than before.
06/02/2025, 5:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: That’s actually amazing! It’s wild how sometimes our bodies surprise us like that. 😀 
Recovery isn’t always linear, and what you’re experiencing could be a mix of factors- maybe the forced rest gave your muscles time to recover fully, or your mindset shifted after the infection, making you push yourself more. Either way... you’re coming back stronger, and that’s what matters! 

How did it feel hitting those heavier weights? More confidence, better form, or just raw strength kicking in?
06/02/2025, 5:42 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Also, after two workouts my five week program will be finished. So previously , I did 3 day gym program , this time I did 4 days superset .
06/02/2025, 5:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I pushed myself .. it was challenging but completed the sets. Also I was angry at my husband hahaha... 

Channeled my strength away from arguments lol.
06/02/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Nida Umer: I worked out after a long time today and yes was suprised at the strength
06/02/2025, 5:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: That anger is raw strength hahaha!
06/02/2025, 5:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Its actually my muscles recovered. I have no pains in my shoulder and feet that I had previously
06/02/2025, 5:47 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I wish I started strength training in my 20's ... It's amazing... But it takes a lot of time and consistency...
06/02/2025, 5:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Everything great in life takes time and consistency 💜 

Glad you're able to do these things now that you couldn't before 🙌🏽
06/02/2025, 5:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Love that! 
That's both a small and big win!
06/02/2025, 5:57 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Hahha
Thanx
Didnt realise that

My driver bumped my car and i was super low. Was on the verge of skipping the workout and just sleeping on the loss. 

I made it to the gym  - so double triple wins

06/02/2025, 6:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's so much more than losing weight.

07/02/2025, 10:20 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I just wanna say thank you to all of you - the groups and the constant ability to reach out to a community of people on the same journey as me has been so wonderful!
07/02/2025, 10:20 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: The pants I wore tonight were tight the last time I wore them and today I had to make them a little smaller 🥲
07/02/2025, 10:23 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 👏👏👏👏 that is the best feeling ! And a huge win !
07/02/2025, 10:28 am - PF - Ali Hassan: That's a win 🎉
07/02/2025, 10:35 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Amazing

07/02/2025, 6:07 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I do need to eventually start thinking of glucose spikes to help reverse my insulin resistance but I know that doesn’t have to look like boring salad either.
07/02/2025, 6:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When you lose weight, your insulin resistance will also get better. 

Without stressing out about insulin spikes.
07/02/2025, 6:15 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Actually…… big rabbit hole … chicken egg .. this whole everything wrong w you is because you’re fat logic .. I don’t subscribe. I’ve reversed my PCOS in the past without losing weight and I had insulin resistance before gaining the weight so ☠️
07/02/2025, 6:17 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I think a lot of the nutrition habits that help reverse insulin resistance and pcos automatically also help lose weight but not vice versa - you can fully lose weight and make your health worse in the process - take it from someone who’s lost a bunch of weight a bunch of ways lol
07/02/2025, 6:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s not always that plain and simple. 

Weight is only ONE part of the equation. 

Insulin resistance simply means elevated insulin levels. 

Why that happens can be for many reasons. 

PCOS is one of them. Your lifestyle is another one. Nutrition can play a role too. 

But think about it this way, if insulin resistance was caused by sugar spikes. Then all atheletes, bodybuilders and children would be insulin resistant. 

Including me. I eat around 600g of carbs when bulking.
07/02/2025, 6:22 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: My point exactly - it’s not that simple. I I HATE when people say lose the weight and everything will be ok.
07/02/2025, 6:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And I don’t think ANY expert worth half a cent (not even 2 cents) would argue weight loss is always healthy. 

In fact ALL of my content targets these crash diets for this very reason.
07/02/2025, 6:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When people say that and you get triggered, it’s understandable. 

But that’s not what I meant. When we say weight loss, it means sustainable, health promoting habits that lead to weight loss. 

Not some crash diet.
07/02/2025, 6:25 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: You’re right - it was a trigger - because I only know what you say not what you mean. Fat people hear this shit from everyone including medical professionals and it’s SO DETRIMENTAL. Now that I know better I do not stand for it and will not hear it.
07/02/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: But I know we’re on the same side! Sorry for just letting all my morning angst out on you 🤍
07/02/2025, 6:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hahahaha no worries and trust me, this fat shaming done by doctors annoys the fuck out of me. 

I have a reel comedy coming on it too 🤣

07/02/2025, 8:52 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I can't agree enough .. my menstrual cycle got so disrupted in the process of losing weight through starving. Until I started eating ... I was literally eating 1000 to 1200 calories. Having a bunch of PCOS supplements endorsed by these so-called influencers.
07/02/2025, 8:55 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I sometimes need to educate my own mum. Because she is always on YouTube shorts watching these health guru videos and then she tells me all those totkay and qewa
07/02/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Went to my gp 2 years ago still traumatised
07/02/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Wo din aur aj ka din hai main ni gya
07/02/2025, 9:42 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Hard relate - I avoid doctors as much as possible too - I worked with an incredible holistic nurse practitioner who helped me a lot a few years ago but then I moved and went back to my old ways. 
Recently I’ve found (for the first time ever) a really good endocrinologist - the man actually spent a whole 40 minutes just listening to me. He can’t do much except prescribe my thyroid meds but the fact that he just listened, didn’t gaslight me, and encouraged me to continue pursuing a healthy lifestyle to lose weight was incredible!
07/02/2025, 9:43 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: @coaches I think the calorie restriction and portion control over the last couple of weeks has me feeling less hungry - like it’s 11am now and I’m only now reaching for my breakfast - how do ya’ll feel about intermittent fasting?
07/02/2025, 9:45 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sounds like your body's adjusting to a lower intake- hunger cues can shift over time when body's getting attuned to hunger cues naturally! 

And IF can be a useful tool if it feels natural, but it’s not magic. If it helps you stay consistent and feel good, go for it! Just make sure you're still fueling properly (overall calories and protein intake) and not under-eating long term. How’s your energy been?
07/02/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: It’s good - but I haven’t started moving or exercising yet 🥲
07/02/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: How do other corporate employees do it 😭😭😭
07/02/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I wake up at 2pm so no idea 😂
07/02/2025, 9:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): this is like an everyday question for me at work my answer is always that for me its very simple i have a mindset like if something is important beneficial and needs to be done then just do it dont make excuses
07/02/2025, 9:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But when I was a corporate employee, I had other strategies. 

Never used to take the elevator. We had lunch 7 floors up and I always took the stairs up and down. 

Used to do short walks after every few hours just to take a break from sitting. 

Put music on when working and that kept my leg banging to the music (hey, it’s still movement)

And then once I was done with work I could fit in other activity like workouts or a walk.
07/02/2025, 9:52 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Can someone shame me into it ☠️

07/02/2025, 10:24 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Same, I just feel so lazy after work that banda sirf souna chahta hai😶‍🌫️
07/02/2025, 10:25 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Yeah and bhook bhi lagi hoti hai and by the time I put dinner together and eat it’s past 7 close to 8 which is pretty close to my 9-10pm bedtime
07/02/2025, 10:26 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: The real struggle is when you’ve already had lunch, but out of nowhere, a sudden wave of hunger—or full-on hanger—hits you during office hours….
07/02/2025, 10:29 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Sometimes we are just bored

07/02/2025, 10:29 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Try to go for high protein options
07/02/2025, 10:30 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Possible yeah.
07/02/2025, 10:31 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Personally I've noticed i eat more when bored
07/02/2025, 10:35 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Or eat more when binge watching something interesting or out of boredom too yes
07/02/2025, 10:36 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: I don't work corporate, but I work two jobs, one at my own organisation, one remote for a global organisation. Both high pressure. Wake up at 6:00, school drop off at 7:15, gym 7:30 to 8:45 - ready to start work around 9:45 after shower and breakfast. It isn't easy though. These days yhe mornings are so cold. I just want to sleep after the drop off.
07/02/2025, 10:36 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 💯 I can relate
07/02/2025, 10:38 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Last year I did 6:30am sessions at a gym for a little bit and it worked because my old job didn’t have a big commute - now I have to be out the door before 8 so unless I start going at 5:30 I don’t see a way
07/02/2025, 10:38 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: My brain is hardwired like this now... Whenever i am watching a season or movie I need something to binge on
07/02/2025, 10:38 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: If you pop your own corn it’s pretty low cal!
07/02/2025, 10:39 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 200 something for a few grams 🥲 moun bhi gilla ni hota mera usy 😂
07/02/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: I got tired after reading this but hats off to you!
07/02/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Lol, I am a morning person and the gym is almost empty so I like it. Just wish I could sleep on time though.
07/02/2025, 10:50 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Same. Sleeping early is a struggle specially when you had busy day with work and other stuff. You just want to chill out at that time hence sleeping late is a habit now
07/02/2025, 11:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you working on the weekends?
07/02/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: No but I’m running errands, cooking, cleaning, and trying to do 1 social activity. Last weekend I got 10K steps in from just the grocery store lol. 
I feel like it’s one or the other - if I’m cooking to eat healthier then I don’t have time to workout. But at the end of the day if I really put effort towards it I should be able to squeeze out time.
07/02/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Ya’ll just need to shame me more 😂
07/02/2025, 11:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do a time audit. That always helps.
07/02/2025, 11:55 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Tell me more
08/02/2025, 12:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Map out where you spend your time. Every thing. From the minute you wake up till when you sleep. 

I’ve done it many times and you always can find some time that’s free or you’re spending it on less important stuff.
08/02/2025, 12:14 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes absolutely Time audit helps alot 
Like just write everything down from the minute you started till it ends, wakeup time breakfast work meals leasure time bed time etc etc everything for a week thats what i did once n never felt a need to do it ever again 
You will find spaces inbetween for home workout or any exercise be it 20-25min to start with once you get regular with it you can always increase the time. <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 12:42 am - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Is there any app you guys can recommend? <This message was edited>

08/02/2025, 2:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeh tou meri bhi life hai hahaha

08/02/2025, 2:39 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: @60193244266 why do we hate ayurveda !!!
08/02/2025, 2:39 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Genuinely curious I have no strong opinions on the matter
08/02/2025, 2:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because half of the pseudoscience in the world comes from there. 

Absolute nonsense like you can’t have fruits at night or if you mix certain fruits with milk, it’ll cause heart issues and what not
08/02/2025, 2:42 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Interesting! I guess I had a more white person pov of it where it’s supposed to be holistic you do yoga eat better feel better etc oops
08/02/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Thanks for sending me down this rabbit hole at 4am - reading through the internet on it now ☠️
08/02/2025, 2:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Ayurveda ko front py rakh k jo non-sense spread hota hai masla actually us sy hai
08/02/2025, 2:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Actual evidence based experts have been calling out Ayurvedic medicine for a while. 

Like Sidhu claimed his wife got cured from cancer because of bloody haldi. 

All while she was in a hospital being treated for cancer for 2 years.
08/02/2025, 2:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Some things in Ayurveda obviously make sense but even a broken clock is correct twice every day.
08/02/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Tell me how you feel about Hakims 😂
08/02/2025, 2:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Every Hakim who is famous goes to a hospital when sick that should be all the evidence you need.
08/02/2025, 2:51 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: My mom goes after me every single time she visits about having methi dana tea  and absolutely believes it will cure migraines. Kalojni  will cure asthma (actually, kalonji  is supposed to cute everything cause, according to some Tibb e Nabwi  book, it is cute for everything apart from death so mom visiting means chugging all sorts of seeds and teas before breakfast.
08/02/2025, 2:52 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Never helped me - but my mom has good placebo thingy going, she is thankfully healthier and more active than any of us siblings.
08/02/2025, 2:55 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: The only thing I have actually seen methi dana help w is diabetes and woh bhi it’s not like you take just methi dana and change nothing else about your diet and exercise and its some miracle (only ginger miracle believer here lol) - it all comes down to what this wonderful team keeps telling us - gotta do it all
08/02/2025, 2:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Placebo effect can be very strong in some people.
08/02/2025, 2:57 pm - PF - Sadaf Khan: Yeah, that was my moms main reason for starting. Both her parents and all her siblings have diabetes.  She has been pro actively maintaining a lifestyle that is optimised to repell diabetes :) and since she has been our only parent for over 2 decades, we are also at her case if she starts slacking. But she believes it is all methi dana.
08/02/2025, 4:44 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: This is different..snow is good. But rain and wind ..... Is not fun

08/02/2025, 6:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse. That's different! 
I don't like rain - I feel like har cheez kharab hojati hai baarish mai 

Karachi mai tou I don't even get out of the house for days when it rains <This message was edited>
08/02/2025, 7:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was hesitating to ask this... But cleaning in the house and doing the chores for a long period of time is tiring .does it burn similar calories if we take around 6000 to 7000 steps but not in one go. 

The difference between walking at a stretch and walking in intervals .
08/02/2025, 7:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Passport daikh kay main bhi yehi sochta hoon 🤣
08/02/2025, 7:40 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: 😂😂😂
08/02/2025, 7:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on a number of factors and what activity is being done. 

Washing the clothes by hands or sweeping / vacuuming is similar to walking.
08/02/2025, 7:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Standing in the kitchen and cooking, probably not.

Hello, this is my first day for following the Project FOMO. I just had the breakfast and this is what I ate. I also plan to do and do workout today. Let me know coaches what you think of this. 💪
08/02/2025, 10:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looks good for started. 

Can’t see any protein so that’s what I’d focus on in the coming days. 

And try to measure most things in grams, not tsp or cups.
08/02/2025, 10:28 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Oh okay. I usually follow 2 meals. 1 breakfast, and then dinner around 7. Lunch main I always do some snacking along with tea if I’m home or take chicken spread sandwiches or Shami Kabab sandwiches when I’m going to office.
08/02/2025, 10:31 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: I usually take proteins in dinner and breakfast. On the weekdays, in breakfast I usually have 2 fried eggs with 2 slices of bread and tea. But i felt lazy today so just had cereal and buttered slices lol
08/02/2025, 10:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Even 2 eggs aren’t enough protein. Especially if you’re only have 2 main meals.
08/02/2025, 10:43 pm - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: And the rest of the proteins are in my dinner. Be it some chicken or daaal
08/02/2025, 10:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Track and see what your total coming out to. I think it’s going to be max 30-40g
09/02/2025, 12:16 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Maybe your videos ... Performing an exercise and explaining something about nutrition.
09/02/2025, 12:16 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I have checked the website on my phone
09/02/2025, 12:25 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: And also, you the coaches can share their own journey of how they got into fitness and what makes them help other people to do it.

Make this as a banner 😋 just my 2 cents... Sometimes people skip the texts and are more interested in visual information just my thought
09/02/2025, 2:41 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Usually in web design if its a landing page they usually have a banner/carousel
09/02/2025, 2:46 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: It's a bit late. But I will forget this in the morning . I discussed this earlier in a Facebook post.  I eat 80% clean. Include my favourite foods in moderation. 

Today, I skipped lunch because I didn't have time. I had  chicken wrap and two spoons of milk cake(it was too sweet so I didn't eat more). I got a headache after 15 minutes . 

Whenever I eat high carbs meals like biryani , pulao or sugary desserts. It happen. Or if I'm fasting and break my fast . Is this something to worry about ?
09/02/2025, 2:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really but I’m interested to know if  you have a proper meal with protein and fibre then this doesn’t happen?
09/02/2025, 2:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m thinking you have some reaction with a high sugar spike.

09/02/2025, 2:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you are doing well with this one, gettinh stronger progressively overloading then you can continue it for another month

09/02/2025, 3:04 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: How many calories are in this ?
09/02/2025, 3:14 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: It doesn't happen everyday . Most of the carbs I have in my breakfast after workout usually. I'm ok . I have good protein, wholemeal or seeded bread. 

It's only when I have sugary dessert or rice in big portions . But it never happened when I was in my 20s. I used to eat 2 plates of biryani in one go with gulab jamun.  Was so skinny lol. That time I was in surplus but weight gain nahi hota tha not even headache.
09/02/2025, 3:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You weren’t in a surplus if weight gain nahin ho raha tha.

09/02/2025, 10:54 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: 2kg?
09/02/2025, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Iss say zaada bhari aap ka hand bag hoga. <This message was edited>
09/02/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Meine 2 kg se start Kiya tha. Some people don't have enough strength when they start off.
09/02/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but 99% can lift 2kgs. It’s more of a mental barrier
09/02/2025, 10:59 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: 3 ya 4 kg 🧐
09/02/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ever picked up a child? Ever picked up a grocery bag? Hand carry? A cat?

All those things are likely more than 2kgs. 

But you can start with 2kg and then assess if it’s challenging enough or not. 

Otherwise start with 3 or 4kg. 

Also it depends on the exercise. 

2kg will be very difficult for something like lateral raises 

But pointless for most people when doing something like rows.
09/02/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: I'll strt with 3 kg
09/02/2025, 11:02 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Dumbell workout is imp ? Ya cardio is best ? <This message was edited>
09/02/2025, 11:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Strength training is gud for building muscles cardio is gud for 🫀
09/02/2025, 11:17 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Muscles play a very important part in fat loss and overall health
09/02/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Yes lateral raise I started with 2 kg . Bench press Bhi nahi hoti fhi mujhse. Curls was ok with 3 kg.
09/02/2025, 11:33 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Now I have gone up to only 7kg in 8 months . And I see girls smaller than me lifting 10 and 15 ...
09/02/2025, 11:35 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 7 kg is amazing !
09/02/2025, 11:36 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: We all have our strengths and weaknesses. No point comparing
09/02/2025, 11:37 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Maybe you are doing more reps and in a more controlled way which is way better
09/02/2025, 11:38 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Some people do ego lifting 😋 which eventually can lead to injury
09/02/2025, 11:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Compare yourself to yourself.
09/02/2025, 11:55 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I don't compare . That's what I mean . We don't know how long the other person has been on the journey and where he started.
10/02/2025, 12:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. Your comparison should be with yourself. 

Are you make progress? Are you stronger than you were a year ago? That’s what matters.
10/02/2025, 1:54 pm - PF - Sadia Subhan: ??
10/02/2025, 1:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use a quarter pounder ki entry

11/02/2025, 10:39 am - PF - Huma Suleman: So should suggest that i should continue 1535calories?
11/02/2025, 10:39 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes
11/02/2025, 10:39 am - PF - Huma Suleman: I stay hungry in this
11/02/2025, 10:40 am - PF - Huma Suleman: How to eat better in 1535 calories without staying hungry
11/02/2025, 10:44 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Prioritize foods with more volume n lesser calories 
the major chunk of your calories around 80ish percent should come from whole foods, protein, veggies, fruits . You can adjust some sweets or foods you genrly crave in the remaining 20% of the calories

eat 20-25g of protein atleast in each meal as protein is more satiating n will keep you fuller for a longer duration. Have a serving of veggies with each meal. Have a fruit as well
11/02/2025, 10:48 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Drink adequate amount of water, get enough sleep & you can add diet beverages to suppress hunger too 

See at which time of the day you feel more hungry & you can adjust the quantity of meals accordingly like have a bigger volume meal when u r more hungry n adjust the other meals/calories accordingly
11/02/2025, 10:50 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: also, id like to add that SOME hunger when losing weight is normal. 

You're in an energy deficit and so itll happen but like Ali suggested, you can minimmize it by focusing on protein, fiber and nutrient dense meals. 

In fact, even things like diet soda can help at times.

I wanted to quit and cancel my subscription but I thought I should stick around longer and give it a try properly so I asked Taha to resume my subscription. I just fear that I'll never make any progress if things stay like this but I dont know how to move forward either. I am not liking myself, my appearance, my habits. This happens to me once in a while, but this time I thought I'd lean in on this community for support so I don't spiral. Any suggestions?
11/02/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Anything stressing u ?
11/02/2025, 11:12 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Was in Same space a while ago, in fact still am! But if it helps just hang in there this too shall pass. Dun stress yourself with results just hang in
11/02/2025, 11:12 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): can you explain abit whats bothering you n why r u having a terrible week 
definitely here for all the support & help
11/02/2025, 11:12 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: btw a bad week can't derail ur progress completely as long as you make a comeback... Speaking from personal experience, I had weeks where i didn't even want to get out of my bed but still maintained my progress

11/02/2025, 11:19 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Tell yourself its OK. Even if you arent making any “progress” just hang in there. Dont stress, that only makes it worse. Sometimes life gets in the way and very few of us are disciplined enough to not let it derail us.

11/02/2025, 11:23 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Honestly being kinder to myself has been a game changer. Some days it’s honestly hard to watch everyone around you have it “easier”. I even get angry about why I have to work harder than the average person to get the same results. But what’s kept me sane through the good days and the bad days has been to cut myself some slack. Even when I’m eating through a bag of chips on the couch - it’s ok. It’s done now. Stress kar ke kya hi hoga. You can only control the controllables and what’s in the past and is done already is not in our control.
11/02/2025, 11:25 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Agreed
I used to crib over this too
Why do other have it seemingly “easy”
But we dont know!!
And also it is what it is!!
11/02/2025, 11:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Look one bad day week or even a month will not ruin your progress or will not stop you from making progress in future

You just have to take it step by step dont try to do all at once. One day at a time. 

ghusa kr k stress out ho k fikr kr k kuch faida to nhi hoga na ulta nuqsaan hoga na. 
If you can start from tomorrow then do what you can dont try to do sb chezain ek e din ma. Jitna hogya good job then next day try to do 1 extra thing n thats how you will build habits and will get into a routine n slowly sb theek hojaega
11/02/2025, 11:26 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): We all here to help you support you guide you 
You can do it you will do it. STAY STRONG DON'T LOSE HOPE
11/02/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: also something that’s helping me this time is taking baby steps. I always fall off the wagon when I try to do it all. Khana healthy bhi ho, low cal bhi, track bhi karna hai, pcos ko bhi dekhna hai, nutrition poori ho, workout bhi karo wo bhi sahi wala ho - and bam couch and chips it is lol 
This time I’m just pacing myself. I started with a calorie deficit with my regular food. I told myself and the coaches week 2 se exercise shuru kargungi and protein bhi up karungi- in week 3 now and haven’t done any of it but I am maintaining the calorie deficit and that is a win. A win is a win no matter how small!
11/02/2025, 11:29 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: As my skinny husband will tell you it definitely is easier for some lol but yeah it is what it is - ghussa bhi ata hai but I can only control my actions 🥲
11/02/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): celebrate snall wins & you will see them turning into big ones gradually
11/02/2025, 11:30 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Think of it this way, there is no end point. Losing 20 kilos or deadliftinf your bodyweight will not be the end of the road. It will only be the start to a healthier, fitter you. So there are no deadlines because there is no ending, if that makes sense. Its an ongoing process and bumps and pauses will come, and days when we go in reverse.
11/02/2025, 11:31 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But thats completely OK and when you are ready just get back up and back on the journey.

I’m just overwhelmed
11/02/2025, 11:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Let’s address this. 

What is overwhelming you? 

Are you struggling with there to start?
11/02/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Fatima Zaheer: Kya Kya keron. Kahan se shuru keron pehle diabetes ko dekhoun ya pehle pcos ko dekhoun, protein intake kaisay puri keron how do I stop thinking about having meetha all the time
11/02/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Fatima Zaheer: I hope I’m making sense
12/02/2025, 12:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You are. Let’s simplify it. 

How about we start with tracking whatever you are eating abhi?
12/02/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I was about to say this... Sb se pehly ye krein
12/02/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And when it comes to this, protein intake, PCOS and even diabetes will all get better with the same habits. So you don’t have to focus on all of those. 

Just focus on your actions. 

And in that, let’s just start with tracking calories for 3-4 days.
12/02/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Nida Umer: Fatima

12/02/2025, 12:39 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: That’s not bad at all! 
Orange 100ish 
Half a burger 500ish 
Roll 600ish 
Chapati 100ish 

Thora over estimate bhi karlo to its a 1500-1600 day
12/02/2025, 12:39 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Tracking helps because it makes you realize you can enjoy things you like in moderation!
12/02/2025, 1:01 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Look fatima just think it like this where has stress lead you to, probably at a worse place so if you have to make things better then stop thinking about the problem rather focus on the solutions which will fix the problems

Now diabetes PCOS protein intake calories tracking etc all are somehow interconnected fixing one of them at a time will help to fix the next one n then all of them ultimately 

Lets start from the one which is the most important one that is calories. Now you know the calories you have to eat in a day. Forget about protein for now yes get some protein in ofcourse but dont think like you have to eat 100g for example target 50g & eat as per the calories you have been told. Once you get going with calories them gradually start increasing protein intake within the calories 

 2 of the issues will be fixed. next increase your activity level add some walk or workout a couple of days maybe. 
Now you will start building habits & will start getting hold of the things you will be much in control of things less anxious n stressed 

Gradually your blood markers will improve n your health conditions will start improving InshaAllah 

You can do it just have faith in yourself first n then on us 💪 <This message was edited>

12/02/2025, 7:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Fatima, deary you can do it. 🌸
When I joined FoMo, it took me almost 15 days to understand the things. The first month I couldn't hit my protein goal on a daily basis. I just focus/learn on how to track calories, be in deficit.and how can I hit my protein and fiber targets.

I have the same issues except diabetes but yes Dr. still says that I'm/we siblings are the potential one for it because my parents are diabetic. But my yearly scanning always shows the opposite.

Don't worry about anything except your mental peace, your preference, all can be managed, these are chronic issues. You cannot cure diabetes or PCOS, you just have to manage them. A gyne Dr. once gave me birth control pills to cure PCOS 🤷🏻‍♀️ hahaha and I was like 🤦‍♀️ okay theek hai, but without identifying the factores behind it seedha yeh. 😊 Everything can be manageable with consciousness and mindfulness. Yes, we get emotional, crazy sometimes. It's pretty normal. Don't stress out k Kuch nhe ho raha. Things take time. 😊

As the coaches said, Initially just focus on Calories tracking. Gradually you will be mindful. Don't give up and just be consistent. Slowly but you will see the difference in your health both physically and mentally. ✨ ❤️ <This message was edited>

12/02/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Nida Umer: And when i joined
I lost 1.5kg instantly due to efficiency in everything 
But i tried to do too much too quickly( and was able to coz i was off from work)
Then life happened … (shitty days at work and zero movement)
And days went by and I couldn’t even read a single msg on this group

I decided to quit coz i had travel coming up.
@60193244266 and @923343773307 spoke to me individually and made me understand the importance of community.

I am back at the weight i started 
I fall of the bandwagon regularly
But i keep trying slowly

🔺I have been able to get back to the gym( been away from it since months)
🔺I have been able to increase steps
🔺I have been able to remove guilt

🔻I am yet to be consistently in a deficit 
🔺But i am very hopeful to reach there iA.
12/02/2025, 9:07 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I think self motivation is the key.
12/02/2025, 9:07 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Alongwith consistency
12/02/2025, 9:08 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Trust me
Every other day I want to say F**k it and go back to bad eating habits
But this last month:
- i developed endometriotic cysts again (something i was operated for 5 years ago- horrid!)
- ⁠my husband got diagnosed with high bp, high cholesterol and in the pre diabetic range

It just an eye opener

12/02/2025, 10:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s the same food everyday then you’re likely at the same calories
13/02/2025, 12:03 am - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Can I add 1 scoop of protein powder in coffee? Like black coffee?
13/02/2025, 12:09 am - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: Might be the most stupid question lol

13/02/2025, 12:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah you can. But if you add it in hot coffee it won’t mixed.
13/02/2025, 12:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to mix it in water or milk first and then add it into a hot coffee.
13/02/2025, 12:25 am - PF - M Rahid Abubakar: I think I will just drink it with water if that’s okay?
13/02/2025, 1:07 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yup no problem at all
13/02/2025, 1:07 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Or u can add skimmed milk
13/02/2025, 1:18 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes, I take it with milk. 

I added it in milk and Weetabix, but it didn't suit me, I didn't like the taste much.

Can you please let me know which exercises to avoid to put the pressure off my toe joint ??

60g ground beef
6tsp oil

14/02/2025, 10:54 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Guys serious question - my yogurt drink box was in the fridge at work but the fridge stopped working - when I got to work today the fridge was garam and so were my bottles - garam like room temperature not hot hot - they’ve been this way for 24 hours now I’d think - I did move them to a working fridge and now I’m thinking aik try kar ke dekhun? 
Genuinely what’s the worst thing that can happen? Like will I die?
14/02/2025, 11:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d try it. You’d know if they’ve gone bad in a sip.
14/02/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Waisay hi khatta hota hai cuz it’s a yogurt drink
14/02/2025, 11:02 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I checked Reddit and all the goras are like throw it away but the desi in me can not justify throwing away food

14/02/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Not the something i would ever recommend trying but i have used a lil over expiry whey protein & multi vitamins  nothing happened and they did benefit
14/02/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Dry stuff over expiry doesn’t bother me - it’s just dairy that I’m scared of
14/02/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Specially cuz America is already such a disease ridden country
14/02/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: But dairy se salmonella type to kuch nahi hota na? Worst case is food poisoning?
14/02/2025, 11:09 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): salmonella i dont think so becasue that can happens from unpasteurized milk as per my knowledge
14/02/2025, 11:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s bad, then you’ll get diarrhea most likely. Especially if it was just a sip
14/02/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Nothing will happen and most likely they are fine anyways. If its gone bad one sip is more than enough to tell you and it wont do any harm.
14/02/2025, 11:17 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Ok I had a sip - tastes the same to me - I’m going for it

15/02/2025, 10:05 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: I checked my weight today empty stomach after one week and the 2 kgs i lost in last 2 weeks i had gained it back i am not on deficit as i just started the group but i definitely didnt eat above my maintenance so am not sure what happened
15/02/2025, 10:05 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: I am soo depressed
15/02/2025, 10:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): It can be just water weight fluctuating if you havent eaten above maintainance
15/02/2025, 10:11 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you dont have to be depressed just wapas deficit ma ajaen & you will see changes
15/02/2025, 11:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Individual readings are affected by a million things. 

I am 1.3kgs higher today than yesterday even though i was in a deficit yesterday. 

But I’ve only slept 5.5 hours so that plus did a very intense leg session yesterday because of which my weight has spiked. 

This is why if you’re using scale weight then use average scale weight otherwise throw the scale away
15/02/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: I slept 5 hours ohh i didn't know that impacts
15/02/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: This message was deleted
15/02/2025, 11:14 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: Whats average scale weight
15/02/2025, 11:21 am - Taha Ahmed: Average scale weight is calculated by taking multiple weigh-ins throughout the week and then finding the average. For example:

Mon: 80kg
Tues: 79kg
Wed: 81kg
Thurs: 80kg
Fri: 78kg
Sat: 78.9kg

Even though your weight fluctuated a lil (which is totally normal due to water retention, food intake, stress, lack of sleep, not pooping before weighing, etc.), if you take the weekly average, it comes down to 79.15kg, meaning you've actually lost 0.85kg compared to the starting 80kg.

This is what real progress looks like. It goes up and down and is never a linear line. :)
15/02/2025, 11:32 am - Taha Ahmed: I know weight fluctuations can be frustrating, but once you understand how to track it properly, it makes the journey so much easier! It was confusing for us too when we started and we used to get thrown off pretty easily because of daily changes... until we understood what's really happening and that it's not actual fat gain. So if you're also feeling stuck or confused, check out the video in the Guides section- it’ll clear things up for you.

Watch it here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/projectfomo/permalink/523567050384911/

And let me know if you have any questions! 🙏🏽
Oh! And have a great great weekend y'all!

P.S. I'll be posting our weekly check-in in the group shortly, make sure you share all your past week's wins and challenges and struggles., so we can help you better.
15/02/2025, 11:34 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: this is not for me right just an example cause i wish my weight was 80
15/02/2025, 11:34 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: i use to use happy scale previously
15/02/2025, 11:34 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's just an example!
And happy scale is a really cool. <This message was edited>
15/02/2025, 11:34 am - PF - Ariba Jaffery: for average weight
15/02/2025, 11:40 am - PF - Nida Umer: And isileye aik alag shitposting group hai but hum har jaga shuru hojate hain
15/02/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Nida Umer: Wanted to throw out my scale today

But my clothes are less snug but the scale doesnt say so <This message was edited>
15/02/2025, 11:45 am - Taha Ahmed: I also want to share a different perspective here. Something that may help everyone - what if we stopped seeing the scale as a verdict and started seeing it as data?

That number on the scale? It’s not a judgment. It’s just information. It's just data. We see data all day, everyday, and it gives us insights.

For example,
1. If your weight stays the same, you’re maintaining (which is great if that’s your goal)
2. If you’re trying to lose but it’s the numbers aren't going down, it tells us something - maybe calories need adjusting, or maybe it’s just water retention
3. If you’re trying to gain but it’s going down, that’s also data- your intake isn’t in a surplus yet

Now that we have this data, we can make adjustments according to our goals instead of shutting down or quitting (that's our common pattern we keep repeating).

The day we start treating these numbers like simple data points instead of letting them define us, we break free from the constant stress of weight fluctuations. And it's us who has associated scale measurements with values, self-worth etc. - so we need to acknowledge that and then tell ourselves that it's not like this and data is just telling us to make a few adjustments to keep moving forward. 

Your heart rate, blood sugar, energy levels - they all ebb and flow. Everyday. Your body weight does too. What matters isn’t a single number, but the overall trend over time!

Zoom out. Trust the process!

I was following a stupid diet and believing myths. But now, I’m super satisfied 😌 
Thank you so much for everything you guys are amazing! 🫶

18/02/2025, 12:15 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I didn’t get to prep for this week - fell off the wagon with hotpot on Friday and didn’t track on Saturday either but started again yesterday - ghar ka khaya mostly carbs but I tracked. Today packed a big lunch and snacks for work but no idea what’s for dinner and the not knowing is the worst. I like being prepared so I’m kind of scared for this week. I also started feeling feverish over the weekend but ginger shots have helped and I’m just hoping I don’t get full blown sick. Weight is going up but I know it’s probably just water retention since I’m ovulating but I hate it anyway. I know the logic but it’s still frustrating lol
18/02/2025, 12:18 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Pretty much normal girlish thingy. Lols. Emotions fluctuations bhi sath sath 🙃Don't worry.

Be in maintenance intake and rock on. 🤓
18/02/2025, 12:22 am - PF - Ali Hassan: We all have bad days, don't worry it won't affect your long term results in sha ALLAH

Taha made this video a couple of days ago on scale weight fluctuations and I’d encourage all of you to go through it. 

A lot of valuable insights there.
18/02/2025, 10:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1KZ9jm4PVx/?

Another day, another informative post. 

This time we talk about body composition and WHY it matters even for your weight loss goals. 

This is also where MOST people go wrong and why so many are what we call ‘skinny fat’
18/02/2025, 10:32 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Informative. ✨
18/02/2025, 11:09 pm - PF - Fatima Zaheer: Guys!!

How do you keep up with your water intake goals? I can’t drink water unless I’m dying of thirst!!!
18/02/2025, 11:09 pm - PF - Fatima Zaheer: Also, do multi vitamins make u gain weight or is it just a myth
18/02/2025, 11:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Myth.
18/02/2025, 11:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I like to drink 1-2 glasses with each meal so that helps. 

Then keep a water bottle with me while working so keep taking sips.
18/02/2025, 11:17 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: <Media omitted>
Big ass water bottle helps
18/02/2025, 11:18 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I also have a thyroid problem that makes me thirsty a lot but I don’t recommend that route 😂 <This message was edited>
18/02/2025, 11:21 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Always keep a water bottle with yourself. 
And One glass of water before every meal. Easily 8-10 glasses ho jatay.
18/02/2025, 11:21 pm - PF - Ahmed Niazi: Keeping a water bottle really helped me. I try to drink a glass and almost every hour and don’t let my bottle go empty. Refilling it also push me to leave the desk and take a walk till water  dispenser.
18/02/2025, 11:22 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Spending on stanley helped in summers coz it kept the water cold and added shashka😂

I keep this 1 gallon jar (3.78ltr) with me on my desk and I make sure I finish the whole thing everyday 
Plus on a normal day, I drink 2-3 cups of coffee and 2-3 cups of tea - that's added  1-1.5ltr water
19/02/2025, 12:07 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Mine is the same size

19/02/2025, 2:14 am - Taha Ahmed: Nope, not inherently bad for health and is generally safe to consume in normal dietary amounts
19/02/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: So my mum telling me aji no moto will melt your bones and lead to cancer is not to be worried about then .
19/02/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Because I use it in Chinese   cooking
19/02/2025, 2:21 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Mummas are cute. Haha
19/02/2025, 2:24 am - Taha Ahmed: I don't think that's true. MSG doesn't do that, otherwise China's population will be far lower than ours, but it's over a billion 

And no one food causes cancer- it's a mix of many different lifestyle factors 😅 

Oh and I don't even have MSG unless when I eat Chinese food from outside (which is once a month) and I still got it... Twice. lol.
19/02/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Some people say it's Haram.   🙊
19/02/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Well ... Ahem.
19/02/2025, 2:28 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I used to put it in everything to enhance the flavour years ago. But I cut it out now only put it in spring rolls and Chinese dishes
19/02/2025, 2:30 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: You can use a mix of soy sauce and dark soy sauce too to get good flavors if you dont feel safe using it.
19/02/2025, 2:31 am - Taha Ahmed: People say that about Whey too because of "rennet" added in it to separate curd from the milk during the curdling process. It's derived from Animal fats (usually pork), but they now use synthetic rennet to make it (plant-based), so it's halaal lol.

MSG is the same!

And people who have no fckn clue about anything say random stupid shit, so we shouldn't listen to them :)
19/02/2025, 2:31 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I don't like any Chinese food without it. So I use it simple. 

Pakistan mai bohat Kuch ain ve hi Haram hai. Khair!  🙊
19/02/2025, 2:33 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly :) 💯
19/02/2025, 2:33 am - Taha Ahmed: Oh, and MSG is considered haram cause of fermentation in it. The same thing happens when we make breads, esp sour dough types. That also produces some alcohol content. Is tarhan sab cheezain haram hoajyengi 🤷🏽‍♂

19/02/2025, 11:02 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Hes gone from 85 to 70. They are prepping for some photo shoot. Have a wierd diet which has no salt also.
19/02/2025, 11:03 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: He looks like he’s about to collapse (seriously) but just amazed at how the weight can literally melt off if u do strict defixit
19/02/2025, 11:03 am - Taha Ahmed: Okay so basically he's mostly lost water weight and then some fat
19/02/2025, 11:03 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Fat also. They track it
19/02/2025, 11:03 am - Taha Ahmed: A lot of people here take steroids to cut weight (water, fat, etc) and get dehydrated af to achieve a certain look

19/02/2025, 11:04 am - Taha Ahmed: When I competed in 2016, I went down from 77kg to 64kg in two weeks 🫣
19/02/2025, 11:05 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: No i’m sure no one took steroids. He went drastic last few weeks i think .
19/02/2025, 11:05 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 🤪
19/02/2025, 11:05 am - Taha Ahmed: And I gained the weight back 3 days after the competition

19/02/2025, 11:06 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Even if it's natural, it's not fitness
19/02/2025, 11:06 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): airfry krlain
19/02/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Sajal: No air feyer🥺
19/02/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Sajal: Fryer
19/02/2025, 11:09 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes for sure. The diet plan was killer.
19/02/2025, 11:09 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 8 egg whites, 300 g chicken and i think 150 yogurt. Now in the days leading up to shoot
19/02/2025, 11:10 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): okay if you say so
19/02/2025, 11:10 am - Taha Ahmed: We had a trainer back in university who competed and got insanely shredded. He swore he never took steroids- just ate boiled chicken, rice, and bread.

Trust me, 99.9% of them lie about their PED use! 
Using them isn’t the issue, but the dishonesty is.

Turns out, he was on all kinds of gear.
I only found out when I once floated the idea of starting PEDs with him, and that’s when he admitted it.

I competed back in university too, and he was the trainer there. Lol!
19/02/2025, 11:11 am - Taha Ahmed: This seems intense, hmm!
But I wonder how he's functioning without carbs/fats 🤷🏽‍♂

Even the ones competing for IFBB pros eat carbs, fats, sodium, etc. <This message was edited>
19/02/2025, 11:11 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Kesi zindage hai yh 🤦🏻‍♀️
19/02/2025, 11:13 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Bro you know well there are only a handful of people in Pakistan who know how to structure a peak week correctly or even a prep 
Majority just cut carbs completely
19/02/2025, 11:13 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Must’ve been tough and must be tough for everyone who does it. Ouch. The idea of 8 egg whites hurt my taste buds
19/02/2025, 11:23 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Loll..like i said he looks like he will fly away with one blow
19/02/2025, 11:27 am - Taha Ahmed: Exactly like my trainer 😂
19/02/2025, 11:34 am - Taha Ahmed: Oh yeah, I know this all too well. I competed too almost a decade ago, and I’ve done the whole ‘cut carbs, fat, salt’ nonsense. Three months of brutal training before the competition, and the last two weeks were extreme - like super extreme... literally everything was off the table. That’s how I dropped 11kg so fast in just 2 weeks 🤷🏽‍♂
19/02/2025, 11:37 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I know i know 
I prepped for a photoshoot in 2021 didnt cut all the carbs but the water manupulation killed me in the last week
I drank 3 gallons of water/day for the first 4 days of my peak week😂 <This message was edited>
19/02/2025, 12:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Who are you talking about? Owais? Pervaiz? 

They’re all natural but yeah, they do an unnecessarily painful diet
19/02/2025, 12:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And waisay I’ve gone from 84kgs to 67kgs abhi in like 6 months where 2 months was a diet break cause I was in Pakistan or my family was here and we were eating out daily.
19/02/2025, 12:22 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yeah all of them. They are not the steroid types. But yes its totally painful and  totally unnecessary.

19/02/2025, 12:45 pm - PF - Palwasha Awan: Hey how can you incorporate 30gm of protein in your breakfast? I get extremely bored from eating eggs all the time. What are the other options?
19/02/2025, 12:46 pm - PF - Minahil Shafaqat joined using this group's invite link
19/02/2025, 12:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: 2-3 eggs, 1 slice of cheese, 1-2 slice(s) of bread, 1-2 sausage(s)

That's easy 28-36gm of protein 

If you want to remove the eggs entirely, you can make a chicken grilled cheese sandwich type etc
19/02/2025, 12:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Shami kabab Sandwich
Chicken pattie burger/sandwich
Chicken kabab
Qeema and roti
Protine smoothie 
Pratha with chicken
Add cheese

So many options.
19/02/2025, 12:49 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Lentils or haleem can also help
19/02/2025, 12:53 pm - PF - Palwasha Awan: I can’t eat sausages 😞
19/02/2025, 12:53 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Shami kebab is a great option then
19/02/2025, 12:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could also use things like Sabroso or KnNs shami kebabs. 

I used to have 2 chapli kebabs by Sabroso with bread and that was around 30g protein.
19/02/2025, 1:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nuggets? Tender pops? Chicken fiery fingers?

Can be a great addition on the side 

Asma, hafsa and sameet have shared great ideas^ as well
19/02/2025, 1:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can bake these things too if you don't have an air fryer
19/02/2025, 1:53 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Do women do the same shit for competitions ??? 

Here I'm stuck on 64... When I workout the next day it goes even more up. Lol 

I think women and men body is different. If women start doing these things it will stop their periods and will be drastic hormone disturbance
19/02/2025, 1:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, they do and so the women who compete don't get period for months and months. A lot of the women who compete in international comps are on gears as well :) <This message was edited>
19/02/2025, 1:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, women who compete mostly don’t get periods around stage / competition time.
19/02/2025, 1:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s normal for them. A side effect of competing. 

Understand that bodybuilding is a sport and most of the things needed to become a top athelete aren’t healthy. 

Things like steroids are common, again not healthy. But necessary for them.

Also, being that lean isn’t healthy long term. 

They’re low on energy, in pain, joints hurt, barely get sleep, always cold, always thinking about food, constantly hungry and don’t get me started on the effects on their libido lol.
19/02/2025, 2:10 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Bohat hi mushkil kaam hai. 😂 
Well those ladies have different goals. ✨

Hum logo k liye hai, Khao, piyo, ash kero. 🤩 Yes in a sustainable way. Hehehe. 🤓
19/02/2025, 2:12 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes v difficult. The grit and determination needed
19/02/2025, 2:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. Different goals. Different lives. Different responsibilities. 

Most of them don’t have a corporate job, or have a house to manage or have kids to look after.
19/02/2025, 2:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And while getting stage lean is incredibly difficult (I’ve been that lean). 

It’s a walk in the park compared to the struggles and challenges that most people (especially parents) go through.
19/02/2025, 2:14 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Corporate job 🥲
19/02/2025, 2:15 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: where people think I have gone mad because I have to walk around to get my steps in for the day
19/02/2025, 2:15 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yeah, we are determined in our lifegoals. 360 degree change. Right.! 🙂 <This message was edited>
19/02/2025, 2:16 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Very rightly said.
19/02/2025, 2:24 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: How much deficit should I start from? Like I have started tracking a week prior and I am aiming between 1300-1500 cals a day
19/02/2025, 2:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Have you made your intro post on Facebook yet? I tagged you on a post, which is basically a guide to get you started. We go over this in that guide
19/02/2025, 2:27 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Might have missed it 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’ll check
19/02/2025, 2:27 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: I am on project site actually and signals here are not my friend. Ill check for sure
19/02/2025, 2:28 pm - Taha Ahmed: No worries, you might have missed since it was five days ago. 
Just tagged you on it again!
19/02/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Thankyou, got my Macros.
19/02/2025, 2:39 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Can I send my Macros here? Facebook is being a pain because of signals?
19/02/2025, 2:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s better if it’s on Facebook- that way, we can easily track your progress, posts, questions, and overall engagement.
19/02/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: No problem, I would do that in a bit.
19/02/2025, 2:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Many people don't understand the significant impacts of being inactive and leading a sedentary lifestyle. If a person gains this Realisation and makes an effort to be more active, he/she should ignore what these people have to think/say. Educate who you can, ignore the negative crowd and keep bettering yourself 💪🏼
19/02/2025, 2:51 pm - PF - Hafsa Ovais: That is what I always do. 
Cannot stress on these things, haha. They just motivate me to do more what I am doing.

20/02/2025, 2:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Comes down to your preference but if you’re going to track weight then you need to track it 3-5 times per week.
20/02/2025, 2:27 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
20/02/2025, 2:32 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Or agar inches ho to weekly krna chaiye?
20/02/2025, 2:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Every 2-3 weeks
20/02/2025, 3:51 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: I have lost 1.5kg on scale in past week and a half, it must be water weight right?
20/02/2025, 3:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Some of it is going to be water weight. Some is fat. 🎉
20/02/2025, 7:59 pm - PF - Jayna Patel joined using this group's invite link
20/02/2025, 8:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’d take that as a win!

And while the scale went down, I’d also consider other lifestyle factors that might have influenced this change.

What do you think you’ve been doing that may have contributed to it?
20/02/2025, 8:01 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Thanks! Just been watching my protein intake and increased physical activity
20/02/2025, 8:03 pm - Taha Ahmed: Also, I’ve been quite sick this past week, so I haven’t been as active as I’d like to be.

On top of that, I’m in the middle of changing cities and moving, so there’s been a lot going on all at once.

Hopefully, things will settle soon and I'll be more active here! 🤞🏽🙏🏽
20/02/2025, 8:15 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: My weight on scale has also started to go down again but I just can’t break the threshold yet. Hopefully this trend will continue to go down now.

20/02/2025, 9:51 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: It’s $200 so I want to know how we feel about it - I still haven’t started going to the gym at all - no yoga nos strength training nothing
20/02/2025, 10:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it will help you bump up your activity level so yea a good investment
20/02/2025, 10:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you’re committed to using it then it makes sense. 

I bought a standing desk and have used it maybe once on the standing setting lol

Could have saved so much money lol
20/02/2025, 10:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: I’ve been using a standing desk for 4 years now... no regrets! Never got a walking pad, but I do pace around like a mom who's listening to what her kids are doing in the house 😂 Lowkey feels like an excuse to abandon my desk and go for a ‘very important’ walk every now and then 🤷🏽‍♂

But honestly, if you’ll actually use it, go for it - I never got one because I knew it’d just turn into an overpriced clothes rack, like half my home gym equipment 😆
21/02/2025, 8:41 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: 🙋🏻‍♀️👋🏻 everyone, 🫶🏻
I wanted to know how often should i switch my workout routine ?
Like I do 3 or 4 total body workouts in a week, do i need to repeat the same workout everyday for 4 weeks?
21/02/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Can I do incline bench press with this machine?
21/02/2025, 8:44 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
And cable crunch on this?
21/02/2025, 9:02 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes can follow the same plan for 4-6 weeks & then based upon how you are progressing can make changes <This message was edited>
21/02/2025, 9:04 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes you can

21/02/2025, 2:32 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>

21/02/2025, 11:53 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Guys wanted to ask how are you guys planning to fulfil the protein intake in Ramazan?
21/02/2025, 11:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I keep my meals similar. Just change to the timings. 

And maybe replace a few items with some Iftar items.
21/02/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Will just try to focus on the overall calorie deficit
21/02/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: And protein shake 🤝
21/02/2025, 11:57 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: I normally dun do a sehri instead do a late dinner so it’s mostly two meals in Ramazan for me.. if anyone has any great recipes to share or tips please do let me know
22/02/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Last ramzan i used to have usual sehri/ breakfast of eggs, toast and greek yogurt. 

Iftari would be a protein shake and then a meal with about 150g chicken.  So it almost added up.
22/02/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Also the only ramzan i lost weight thanks to sameet
22/02/2025, 12:05 am - Taha Ahmed: What kind of recipes and tips?
Tell us more and we'll def look into it
22/02/2025, 12:14 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Can we have sehri and iftar meals guide. Yes usually there are two meals, suhoor and iftar. Kiu k nind bhi poori kerni hoti, so it's tough to manage more meals or snacks. 

I'm also looking for a protein intake guide in Ramadan.
22/02/2025, 12:23 am - Taha Ahmed: Alright, what else?
22/02/2025, 12:24 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Only this from my side. 🤷🏻‍♀️
22/02/2025, 12:35 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): For me its absolutely basic 

eggs oats milk in sehri 
chicken & fruits in aftaari
whey protein in post workout
22/02/2025, 12:58 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I love this
22/02/2025, 12:59 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Simple, easy and time saving
22/02/2025, 9:46 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Hellooo🙋🏻‍♀️
Other than chia seeds, can someone please list some good sources of fiber?
22/02/2025, 9:54 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: What is the best time to workout in Ramadan?
22/02/2025, 10:09 am - Taha Ahmed: So plenty of fiber-packed options besides chia seeds! You could try berries, apples (skin on, don’t cheat 😆), oats, quinoa, lentils, chickpeas, nuts, seeds, and ofc, veggies, like broccoli and carrots. Even sweet potatoes count!

My regular favs are oats, nuts, and veggies, and sometimes apples and berries
22/02/2025, 10:10 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: 😃😃 thankyou,🫶🏻
22/02/2025, 10:12 am - Taha Ahmed: There's no one-size-fits-all best time to work out in Ramzan, it totally depends on your energy levels, schedule, and workout type. Some prefer pre-iftar for a fasted session (that's my fav timing- I function better and am more productive), others right after iftar for more fuel, and some go for late-night or suhoor-time workouts. 

So try different timings and see what feels best for you!
22/02/2025, 10:13 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
22/02/2025, 10:13 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Ispaghol 😎
22/02/2025, 10:14 am - Taha Ahmed: As a supplement? Yes! 😂
It's not a wholefood tho 🫠
22/02/2025, 10:14 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Also, one more thing,
Are there any benefits of sole water?
Like does it help with migraines? 
Or provides extra hydration or something?
22/02/2025, 10:15 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Or just a myth?
22/02/2025, 10:17 am - Taha Ahmed: There's no such thing as 'extra' hydration! Unless you drink 1ltr of this special water and it turns into 3ltr 🤷🏽‍♂
And not sure if it helps with migraines or not - but it's basically like drinking ORS, try that and see if it mitigates migraines?

Def a myth! <This message was edited>
22/02/2025, 10:17 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Ok ok🙊🙊
22/02/2025, 10:53 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): there is no best time. best time is what suits your routine 
if its before aftari then try to get it done close to aftari like you finished your session and in like 45ish min u r having aftari n aftari k baad to just let the food digest n u can workout

22/02/2025, 3:30 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I think we need to develop some liking for both items
22/02/2025, 5:08 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Weetabix and fruit and fiber cereal. Good fibre but high on calories..I find blueberries and kiwi really helpful with bowls. Wholemeal bread . Oranges and clementines .pineapples

The therapist was telling me it will aid with fat loss. If you combine it with a good diet and exercise.
23/02/2025, 3:09 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Is it true ? Or she is just trying to get me booked for another session ?
23/02/2025, 3:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Hijama helped me with my hormones and infertility in the past . So I was just curious to know
23/02/2025, 3:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): there is no evidence at all that hijama will help with weightloss
must be some psuedo-science she believes in
23/02/2025, 3:19 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I was thinking.. may be stress and cortisol related issues that make PCOS women lose weight slower than normal hormone girls.

24/02/2025, 7:37 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): log for samosa pati & ingredients used in roll
Add the amount of oil you used <This message was edited>
24/02/2025, 7:37 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: How to measure oil?
24/02/2025, 7:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Air fried.
24/02/2025, 7:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This was 40 calories for the wrap and about 35g chicken per roll. 

If you deep fry you can easily add 120-200 calories of oil to it.
24/02/2025, 7:39 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.and how to know fat content in this?
24/02/2025, 7:39 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Same must gies with pakoras?

24/02/2025, 7:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If I fried this instead then it could easily be 400-500 calories instead of 160.
24/02/2025, 7:48 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Thats a huge difference...
24/02/2025, 7:53 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly

I’ve completed my first month with fomo and it gave me anxiety so much so that i did nothing ! 🙁 It was a bit of an all over the place month, and as always my food choices went for a six.

25/02/2025, 6:23 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Keep boiled eggs on hand
25/02/2025, 7:52 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: In the beginning when I wasn't getting enough protein I even ate 13 boiled egg whites in a day🙈
25/02/2025, 8:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Boiled? 🤢
25/02/2025, 8:08 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Yes 😑

25/02/2025, 8:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s better lol

25/02/2025, 11:45 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I think the price is good
26/02/2025, 12:54 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Jzk
26/02/2025, 12:54 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: The shop I bought from had 50 different brands
26/02/2025, 12:55 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I have just finished it. Started my whey protein journey with this. A good one. 👍

But my flavour was chocolate. <This message was edited>
26/02/2025, 12:58 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thanks ...I will try my best to take protein from food. But the days when I can't I will have this
26/02/2025, 1:04 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Good strategy. I try to do the same. The tub will last longer too
26/02/2025, 1:05 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I also wanted to know . If my calorie deficit is 1600 and if I eat more than my calories. And do 10k + steps and also weight training that day. And most of my food is healthy . Would I still be in deficit or not
26/02/2025, 1:06 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Like today I did 14000 steps and also upper body workout . But I had 1700 calories in my food
26/02/2025, 1:13 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: It's just one day and you are most probably still below your maintainence calories which means you are still in deficit. So you needn't fret too much and can move on
26/02/2025, 3:11 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Didn’t log for 3 days - Saturday was an intentional break (and while I didn’t log I don’t think I went over w cals) - but Sunday mental health took a nose dive, ended up binging like I haven’t in a long long time. Took Monday off of work is how bad brain was effing w me, continued to eat my feelings away. 
Trying today. <This message was edited>
26/02/2025, 3:12 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Ye hum sb ki mental health ki tabahi kio hoi pari hai 🥲
26/02/2025, 4:29 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 100 calories isn’t an issue anyway.
26/02/2025, 4:30 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: These days happen. What’s important is recognizing that but not letting it continue. 

You don’t have to be perfect but just try making small shifts. Maybe start with a good high protein meal.
26/02/2025, 1:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sometimes life throws us off track, and that's okay. A couple of tough days don’t erase all the work you've been putting in- what you've done in the last few weeks is who you actually are. Detours happen, but as long as you find your way back, you're still moving forward. Whether it was 2 days or 5, it doesn’t define you. What does? The fact that you’re here, showing up today. That’s what matters

Keep showing up and like Sameet said, don't let it continue! 
(And do it from a place of love, and def not to punish yourself!) 

It'll get better, trust me!
I'm kind of in the same boat since I've moved, but I'm letting myself move slowly through this transition.
26/02/2025, 2:24 pm - PF - Sajal: Just wanted to share 
Lost 2 inches of my belly after months!

26/02/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Love seeing people sharing their wins ❤️🙌🏼
26/02/2025, 3:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is amazing 🤩
26/02/2025, 9:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Amazing!! How did that make you feel?  
I’m sure you must be proud of the effort you’re putting in- Just curious, what’s been the biggest change for you that helped get here?
26/02/2025, 9:03 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Amazing!!!
26/02/2025, 9:03 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Congrats on the move!
26/02/2025, 9:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Thank you! I'm currently in Lahore, will be going to Hunza in March -so there's another move in the pipeline lol 😅
26/02/2025, 9:08 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Hunza for good ? Or just for the retreat ?

26/02/2025, 10:21 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Let me know if it's a kid friendly place and safe

I'll keep coming back n forth for my medical shizz, but I'll mostly be stationed in Hunza for the rest of the year 😀
26/02/2025, 11:59 pm - Taha Ahmed: Aajayen aap! 
I'll organize a retreat for all FoMo Legends 😅
27/02/2025, 12:00 am - Taha Ahmed: Hunza or the place we're hosting the retreat at?
27/02/2025, 12:03 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Hunza
27/02/2025, 12:04 am - Taha Ahmed: Ofcourse Hunza is kids friendly and an extremely safe place!
27/02/2025, 12:05 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I mean reaching there by road . . Is it straight forward or lots of dangerous pathways
27/02/2025, 12:08 am - Taha Ahmed: Off-season, the only flight available is from Islamabad to Skardu, followed by a 5-6 hour drive to Hunza. The ride itself is safe, though a bit bumpy. Occasionally, avalanches or landslides can delay travel, but for the most part, the route remains accessible.
27/02/2025, 12:08 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thanks
27/02/2025, 12:19 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: If you are going by road through naran, then roads are in very bad condition.
27/02/2025, 12:22 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: I really want to visit hunza.. the only thing that scares me are those broken roads and hills
27/02/2025, 12:27 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Then check weather, take breaks like add a night stays after 6 to 7 hours of travelling and ofcourse driver must be expert with a suppprtive vehicle.Karakram highway is mesmerizing, one must travel but with proper preparation.Road near chillas is also not in very good condition.Hunza is worth the visit.

Spices have no calories and all sabit masalas are used

27/02/2025, 2:14 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Also, I used lean beef

10g protein 
9g fat
27/02/2025, 2:19 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: 10.5g carb

27/02/2025, 2:20 am - PF - Adeeba Saleem: Can anyone tell me how to calculate calories?
27/02/2025, 2:21 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Sabroso shami is 58 cal with 6g protein.
27/02/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Hafsa Ovais: Of this size? These seem small but they re actually medium sized
27/02/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Plus their one chapli kabab is for 113 cal and 10.9gm protein.

Your details. If not, then pls make a post there with your details. Coaches will respond to you there with your targets.

Plus there are posts on how to calculate calories.
27/02/2025, 2:30 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Follow the steps, get to know about your targets, gradually you will learn everything. 

Btw the welcome to FoMO. 😊 <This message was edited>
27/02/2025, 2:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sabroso is chicken so it’s leaner. This is beef. Beef will always have more calories (extra fat)
27/02/2025, 2:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: These are fantastic and a great way to have easy protein to go options ready.
27/02/2025, 3:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hey Adeeba, 

Welcome. 

Would love to help you out. 

@923343773307 must have tagged you in a welcome post. The one you have shared above. 

Follow the steps shown in the post and you’ll get a basic understanding of the process. 

From there on, it’s just practice.
27/02/2025, 9:36 am - Taha Ahmed: I've done full road trips too, and they’re not the most pleasant- especially with Chillas being a red zone where you should never stop due to the locals there.  

The best route would be to first travel to Islamabad, take a flight to Skardu, and then drive to Shigar, Hunza, or Gilgit- if budget allows. Otherwise, traveling in a group by road is also a decent option.  

The roads are much better and safer than they were five years ago! Esp cause of the Chinese interventions now. :)
27/02/2025, 9:38 am - Taha Ahmed: I've mentioned in the tagged comment that if the link doesn't work (which it  doesn't for some), you can go to the group's homepage > click on Guides and get started

And hey @923310365250, welcome to the community! 😊 <This message was edited>

I can feel pain here . I did lateral raises and bench press with slightly increased weights on Tuesday
28/02/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: When I try to hold something I feel it. It's not bad bad pain
28/02/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: But I can feel it.
28/02/2025, 2:29 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: My left side is weaker than right but it has gotten better
28/02/2025, 2:35 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Just wanted to make sure I have not got any injury
28/02/2025, 2:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it must be muscle soreness as you increased the weight if your overall shoulder mobility is fine
28/02/2025, 2:59 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Thanks. So I don't need to do anything. Was wondering I did upper body on Tuesday and it's Friday . Why I do feel it today. I did lower body yesterday.
28/02/2025, 3:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could just be soreness like Ali mentioned. Or a minor sprain.
28/02/2025, 4:30 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I want to know about whey protein?When and how to use it.I jus do not know anything about it.
28/02/2025, 4:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can use it at any time if you’re struggling with protein intake. 

Can use it directly or use it for recipes.
28/02/2025, 4:48 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Any side effects or digestion issues?From where shall i source it.
28/02/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Unless you’re lactose intolerant. 

Then you can get whey isolate which is lower in lactose. 

Look at Alpha nutrition for sourcing it. <This message was edited>
28/02/2025, 4:54 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: How to know ik din mai minimum kitna use karna ha
28/02/2025, 4:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can use 2-3 scoops. I personally use 1.25 scoops daily. 

Depends on your protein intake
28/02/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok
28/02/2025, 4:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: For example. If I'm done with my meals for the day and find my protein target incomplete, I use 1 scoop (mine has 25g in 1) to complete it
28/02/2025, 4:58 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I have seen so many strange stories in media about this powder, that i was actually afraid to even think abt it....
28/02/2025, 4:58 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Laga jase koi blast hu jiaga body mai.isko use karne se....
28/02/2025, 5:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: It's the same protein you get from milk, cheese, yogurt, just in powder form that's all
28/02/2025, 5:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You’re already having it.

28/02/2025, 5:38 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Listed some benefits and sources here.
28/02/2025, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, it helps build muscle, retain muscle (means better health as you age with lower chances of arthritis, sarcopenia and better bone health), improves immunity, improve recovery and helps with hair and skin health. 

Plays a role in appetite too.
28/02/2025, 5:55 pm - PF - Duaa Javaid: Kiya yeh matter karta hai k pani ek certain amount tak dalna hai, to gain benefits of whey protein ya it doesn’t matter how much water / milk I use for whey protein? For example: I take 1 scoop in 500ml water/milk. Ya liquid ratio kam ya ziada hona chaiye?
28/02/2025, 6:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It doesn’t matter.

It impacts taste though.
28/02/2025, 6:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I use 300 ml milk but the recommended amount was 250 its all about personal preference for me i use more milk to elemenate the after taste

My self. Suggest some renowned brands available in pakistan.
And what is mean by that halal/haram concept in whey protein. How can I choose the right one.
28/02/2025, 11:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): buy from an authentic store

28/02/2025, 11:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Pakistan ma mostly yehi milaingy
28/02/2025, 11:47 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Which store would you recommend?
28/02/2025, 11:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): AlphaNutrition
You can give them my reference for 10% discount
28/02/2025, 11:48 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And ye whey protein halal/ haram ka kya concept hay?
28/02/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok🤩
28/02/2025, 11:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro whey Milk sy bnta hai so agar milk halal hai to whey b halal hai

01/03/2025, 1:49 am - Taha Ahmed: I think it worked when the system retried the payment. Just leavea a 👍 reaction if it’s processed on your end!
01/03/2025, 1:52 am - Taha Ahmed: @923138979695 this should also clear some misconception around Whey being halal/haram
01/03/2025, 1:56 am - Taha Ahmed: Ramadan Mubarak to you as well! Wishing you peace, blessings, and a fulfilling month ahead! ❤
What have you planned for Sehri and Iftar?
01/03/2025, 1:57 am - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
Myprotein is a safer option...
01/03/2025, 1:59 am - PF - Ayesha Asif: Eggs and yoghurt bread some fruits 
Iftar ... Roast dinner
01/03/2025, 2:00 am - Taha Ahmed: My favorite brand! 🥹
01/03/2025, 2:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yesterday Restocked my cookies and protein bars 😂 <This message was edited>
01/03/2025, 8:19 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Ramadan Mubarak everyone
01/03/2025, 8:23 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Had 3 🥚 with 100g chicken franks and some spinach = 32g protein 🙌🏼
01/03/2025, 11:01 am - Taha Ahmed: That’s interesting!

I’ve been struggling to get proper meals here in Lahore since I don’t have access to a kitchen at my current place. And I am used to cooking my own food. So, these days I mostly rely on outside food, and well… my stomach isn’t loving it.

@60193244266  came through with a brilliant idea! He said, “Taha, just get some shawarma chicken, grab some bread (like tortillas, pita, etc.), or even fresh cut salads, and make your food at home.” Simple, inexpensive, better quality, fewer tummy issues, and more protein!

I’m starting this today! 💪🏽 <This message was edited>
01/03/2025, 11:36 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>

01/03/2025, 11:36 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): This is concentrate
01/03/2025, 11:37 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Isolate from MyProtein is IsoWhey
01/03/2025, 11:38 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Alpha nutrition pay isolate available nahi from this brand. 
Ye may aur kaha say buy kr skta hu

01/03/2025, 11:39 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): bro you have to check

01/03/2025, 11:40 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Attempting to roza tomorrow and realizing idk what sehri foods are - I don’t even do breakfast so idek what good breakfast foods are - something low sugar so I stay full longer?
01/03/2025, 11:40 am - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I have some shami kababs in the freezer I could make a paratha roll?
01/03/2025, 11:46 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If i plan something considering your routine and eating pattern, i would just try different combos for initial 2-4 days and see how i feel n then what feels the best ill just stick with it for most part. So my preferred sources will be 

Paratha/roti for carbs
eggs/chicken/shami/whey/greek yogurt for protein 
some veggies in omelet for fiber
01/03/2025, 1:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This sounds delicious waisay. In Pakistan, I used to have 2 sabroso shami kebabs, 1 chapli kebabs, some yoghurt and 2 slices of bread
01/03/2025, 3:21 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 ye frozen items ko daily use kr skty hay?
01/03/2025, 3:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yup, you can! If you’re eating whole foods throughout the day, you can definitely include these as part of your daily intake
01/03/2025, 3:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
01/03/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: My weight is 55.40 kg on an empty stomach and I don't want to lose weight how can I gain muscle while maintaining this weight?
01/03/2025, 4:37 pm - Taha Ahmed: Then it time to focus on body recomposition now

1. Keep up with strength training (if youre currently training) and prioritize progressive overload (lifting heavier over time) with compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and presses, etc.
2. Keep up with protein intake (for both muscle retention and gain)
3. Slight caloric adjustment and stay around maintenance calories but adjust based on progress. Some days, a small surplus (~100 kcal) may help with muscle recovery and growth
4. Track strength gains and if you're getting stronger, you're likely building muscle
5. Focus on rest & recovery (plenty sleep everyday)
01/03/2025, 4:39 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Sleep hardly 6 hours 😑
01/03/2025, 4:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: Focus on adding another 20-30 mins every week and eventually try to get 7-8 hours
01/03/2025, 4:45 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Kya mujhe cardio chor dena chaiye?
01/03/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can still do it for health. 

Cardio isn’t necessarily done for weight loss.
01/03/2025, 6:41 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I have got a 3L water bottle and filled it with 2L which I don't finish the end of the day.
01/03/2025, 6:41 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Realised that I don’t drink enough water.
01/03/2025, 6:41 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: These tracking bottles help.
01/03/2025, 6:42 pm - PF - Sajal: Apple cider vinegar before suhoor is good option?
Or it will cause hunger?
01/03/2025, 7:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For what reason?
01/03/2025, 7:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It doesn’t cause hunger though
01/03/2025, 7:21 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: The home based kitchen options at Food Panda has good options at your locality (Lahore). Do try some.
01/03/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I have planned the same with roti (no bread) with cabbage Ka salan for my sehri 😂

Aisay hi combination hon ge. Quick and filled.
01/03/2025, 7:30 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Ramadan Kareem!
01/03/2025, 8:07 pm - PF - Sajal: burning fat🙊
01/03/2025, 8:32 pm - PF - Humaida: Sameet has so many videos on all these myths 😂
Watch them
01/03/2025, 8:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If ACV really burnt fat, you wouldn’t need us lol. 

We could have all just had apple cider vinegar with every meal and would have looked like Hollywood stars 🤣
01/03/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Does sleeping 8 hours in sequence have the same benefit compared to 8 hours consective sleep.
As in Ramadan it gets difficult 8 hours straight.i sleep 2,3 hours at night and then 4,5 hours in day time.
So will this give me the same benefit?
01/03/2025, 9:05 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: In one go is slightly better but if that’s not possible then breaking it can help get you almost close to the same benefits, given that total time is the same.
01/03/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
01/03/2025, 10:58 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Workout k bad 30mins  me protein lena zaroori hai ?
01/03/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
01/03/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Rabia Rehman: Does having fruit chaat in iftari cause bloating if you have IBS ? if so what’s a good alternate
01/03/2025, 11:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. Some fruits might trigger IBS. Not all.
01/03/2025, 11:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Everybody with IBS experiences these things differently. It's not the same for anyone
01/03/2025, 11:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Basically, some fruits are high in certain FODMAPS and you might have issues with certain FODMAPS. 

Fruits that are high in FODMAPs include apples, apricots, cherries, figs, mangoes, nectarines, peaches, pears, plums, and watermelon. 

Most fruits chats have at least one of these. 

Why are these fruits high in FODMAPs?

Well, Apples contain high levels of fructose and polyol-sorbitol, which can trigger diarrhea and worsen IBS symptoms. 

Ripe bananas are high in oligo-fructans, which are a type of FODMAP and cause issues for some people.
01/03/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coaches, can you guys share your workout routine during ramadan?
01/03/2025, 11:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): like our personal workouts ?
01/03/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yeah
01/03/2025, 11:53 pm - PF - Rabia Rehman: what are good options for iftari with ppl who have IBS
01/03/2025, 11:54 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ll be uploading the program I am following this Ramadan to the excel sheet tomorrow.
01/03/2025, 11:54 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
01/03/2025, 11:56 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i can upload mine too
01/03/2025, 11:57 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Usually i do empty stomach workouts in the morning so  I am looking to continue that in ramadan as well as I am looking to workout after suhoor

02/03/2025, 11:07 am - PF - Ali Hassan: 15 cals in how many grams ?
02/03/2025, 11:07 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: 1tsp
02/03/2025, 11:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 1tsp is 4-5 grams so yea 15-20 calories
02/03/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yup
02/03/2025, 11:08 am - Taha Ahmed: 1 tsp = ~5gm
5gm sugar has 5g carbs 
1g carb = 4 kcal

So 5g sugar = ~20 kcal
02/03/2025, 11:09 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: So can i have 1 glass of shikanjbeen?as i dont like tasts of sucral
02/03/2025, 11:09 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: I want to ise sugar
02/03/2025, 11:09 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Use

02/03/2025, 11:15 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Is magnesium a good supplement to take?
02/03/2025, 11:16 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Or are there any downsides of taking it? 
I am currently taking semaglutide, which supplements can be taken along with semaglutide?
02/03/2025, 11:19 am - Taha Ahmed: It depends! No supplement is inherently good or bad and you don't always need it unless you've some nutritional deficiencies
02/03/2025, 11:22 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Acter taking semaglutide,
It triggered my migraine so bad that no medicine is helping, it also affected my sleeep🥺 plus i am badly constipated & no laxatives are working 🥺
02/03/2025, 11:22 am - Taha Ahmed: Magnesium can generally be a good supplement, esp if you have signs of deficiency like muscle cramps, poor sleep, or fatigue (common symptoms) - it plays a key role in muscle function, nerve signaling, and even blood sugar regulation. But that said, not all magnesium supplements are the same- some forms (like magnesium citrate) can have a laxative effect (usually given to clear GI), while others (like magnesium glycinate) are better for relaxation and sleep.

Since you’re on semaglutide, it’s worth considering how your digestion is responding, as semaglutide can sometimes cause nausea or GI issues, and magnesium (depending on the form) could either help or worsen that. Are you experiencing any side effects? And what’s your main goal for taking magnesium- better sleep, recovery, digestion? Or just general optimal nutritional intake?

Since you may be eating less on semaglutide, there’s a higher chance of nutrient deficiencies over time. It’s always a good idea to check in with your GP and see what they recommend based on your needs!
02/03/2025, 11:22 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: So i thought i should buy this one, only of you recommend
02/03/2025, 11:25 am - Taha Ahmed: That sounds really tough! These are common side effects of semaglutide, so it's definitely best to check in with your doctor to see if any adjustments are needed. In the meantime, for constipation, increasing fiber (especially soluble fiber) and staying well-hydrated might help. Magnesium citrate can also support digestion, but since you mentioned migraines and sleep issues, it’s worth seeing what your doctor recommends!
02/03/2025, 11:26 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Ohh so many side effects honestly, the first month woth semaglutide went really smoothly just some nausea, but as i jumped to a higher dose in the second month, the migraine, sleeep & constipation, it’s so bad i cannot even describe 🥺
I was fasting yesterday & i almost fell to the ground while preparing iftar😭
02/03/2025, 11:49 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Cant we take enough magnesium from diet?
02/03/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 can you provide some information regarding your workshop after eid?

02/03/2025, 10:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I find it better than most brands.
02/03/2025, 10:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also depends on how you’re making it
02/03/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It's less sweet, I think.  
I just add water and shake it. Same happened to me when I started my last one. After some days, theek ho gaya tha. Might it be okay too after a few days. 

Is there some other way to make it?
02/03/2025, 11:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No protein shake in the world tastes nice in water to me
02/03/2025, 11:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: So I use low fat milk.
02/03/2025, 11:19 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I had it in milk once but with Weetabix. 

Mmmm let's try it in milk tomorrow. 👍
02/03/2025, 11:21 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Agree 😭
03/03/2025, 3:49 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: <Media omitted>

03/03/2025, 4:25 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: This is why I'm afraid to use mine in water 😆 I always have it in cold milk
03/03/2025, 4:28 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I tried mine in water a few times just because i didn't have the calories for milk
03/03/2025, 5:18 am - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Is there huge difference between in terms of calories between sourdough bread and white bread?
03/03/2025, 5:20 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no not a huge difference interms of calories 
per 100g sourdough will ~275 calories & white bread will be around 260-265 calories
03/03/2025, 5:21 am - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: No point replacing it then! Thanks!
03/03/2025, 5:25 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes not interms of calories 
nutritionally sourdough will be a touch better but not a huge difference at all. People with gluten issues unky leay sourdough is the preferred option
03/03/2025, 5:46 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: People with taste, unkay liye be sourdough is better 🤣😂
03/03/2025, 2:46 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Hey coaches, usually I was following FOMO’s 5day gym workout plan but in ramadan I can’t manage time to go to gym. I have a barbell rod,resistance bands and some dumbbells at home so I’ve decided that for this month(ramadan) I will be doing home workouts to maintain consistency. So please suggest which workout plan should I follow and wil this be ok I mean will this benefit me the same compared to gym based workout plan?
03/03/2025, 2:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Start the 4 day home workout plan that’s in the community.
03/03/2025, 2:51 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Will this benefit me the same compare to 5 day gym based workout plan?
03/03/2025, 2:53 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): not the same but we can say comparable
03/03/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ramadan may Bohat mushkil horha hay gym jana aik to gym Bhi mujh say 6,7km dor hay dosra jab gym ke liye time nikalata hu to phr sleep puri nai kr pata, kabhi kabhi weather ka Bhi masla hota hay
03/03/2025, 3:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly why you shouldn’t compare. Theres no harm in maintaining progress in Ramadan
03/03/2025, 3:13 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Isi liye home workouts start krha ta ke consistency maintain rak saku and after Eid I will be back to gym inshallah
03/03/2025, 3:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Perfect
03/03/2025, 4:16 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I think sourdough is made with key ingredients 3 or 4 . Othe breads have almost 12 15 ingredients to preserve it. Nutritionally different Nahi Hoga . But in my opinion more natural is better.
03/03/2025, 4:18 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Sourdough is gut friendly . Fermented flour HOTA hai or prebiotics hote Hain.
03/03/2025, 7:21 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I made a post on FB. When you get time then respond .
03/03/2025, 7:22 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: I freeze my membership to gym during ramzan routine is tough
03/03/2025, 7:22 pm - PF - Ayesha Asif: Doing workout from home.
03/03/2025, 7:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahh okay.
04/03/2025, 6:16 am - PF - Aafiya Khan (Saba/Aaish): Feeling weakness and random body pains so thinking to go through blood tests which deficiencies i could likely have which tests should i go through?
04/03/2025, 6:42 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: How much protein can we consumed per meal? I mean is it Oky if we take 60-70g per meal?
04/03/2025, 6:44 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): there is no limit to how much you should be consuming per meal 
you can split daily protein intake into as many meals as you want or even in all in 1 meal. totally your preference
04/03/2025, 6:45 am - PPF - Fatima Niazi requested to join.
04/03/2025, 10:15 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: In community’s 4day home workout plan how manny times I target each muscle group in a week? And instead of it can I train single muscle each day 6 days a week
04/03/2025, 10:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2 times per week. 

You could, but I’m not a fan of single muscle training and the research doesn’t support it either. 

Especially when you’re training at home and using lighter weights. 

Doesn’t make sense to wait 7 days to hit a muscle again
04/03/2025, 10:22 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: ok then i will continue 4 day home workout plan
04/03/2025, 10:24 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266  I my 3 year old cousin sister is suffering from blood deficiency. Or there any specific foods or supplements that can help her overcome blood deficiency
04/03/2025, 10:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Have you seen a doctor?
04/03/2025, 10:27 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>

04/03/2025, 10:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What did the doctor say?
04/03/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: He said focus on her diet and suggest some foods to her parents to give her and i didn’t know much about that. Her father told me all of this and said ask your coaches if they can help
04/03/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: My niece once had a very serious blood/iron deficiency. At the age of 3 to 6 years. Her deficiency was not overcoming and then she was diagnosed with Gluten allergy. It's very common for today's kids. 

My 20 year old cousin has been diagnosed with it recently and the symptoms were serious iron deficiency. It's a suggestion to please do check her on it as well.

05/03/2025, 8:07 pm - PF - Hira Fatima Rizvi: Any idea on how much calories would a home made iced pistachio latte have? Approx? Just seem to be craving for one for iftar
05/03/2025, 8:11 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depends upon how you make it & in what quantity you have used the ingredients 
it can be anywhere between 150-250 or maybe 300 calories depending ingredients and their quantity
05/03/2025, 8:13 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
Let's try this one as well. 😉
05/03/2025, 8:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): it tastes good 
cookies n cream is always a good option
05/03/2025, 8:15 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: How much did this cost can i ask?
05/03/2025, 8:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): around 42-45ish thousand if i'm not wrong if bought from Pakistan
05/03/2025, 8:16 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 😱
05/03/2025, 8:16 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I don't know guys. My brother brought for me from the UAE. <This message was edited>

05/03/2025, 8:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): in Pakistan its easily 42-45k
05/03/2025, 8:18 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I don't believe in buying it from Pakistan. Scam hi scam.
05/03/2025, 8:18 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Will stick to protein factory. I dont have very often, so its a good reasonable option.

05/03/2025, 8:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): we have super authentic stores but the price is just too high for supplements here in Pakistan due to the exchange rate and taxes
05/03/2025, 8:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: you'll need to track the ingredients, mainly the pistachio, milk, and any sweeteners you use, etc - on average, a serving could range from 150-250 calories like Ali said - but it can very well go over 400-500 calories 🤷🏽‍♂

weigh and track ingredients for more accuracy
05/03/2025, 8:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it's insane these days!
I wanted to get some whey cause it's not feasible for me to cook here, and the prices rocked my world 🥹
05/03/2025, 8:23 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly. It costs 289 derham from there, I guess.
Which store is authentic here? If you can share the name.

06/03/2025, 4:35 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Since increasing my protein intake, I've experienced constipation issues consistently . Is this likely due to the high protein and low fiber content of my diet, or could there be other underlying reasons?
06/03/2025, 4:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's likely due to low fiber and hydration- higher protein intake can sometimes crowd out fiber-rich foods, and protein metabolism increases water needs. Try adding more veggies, fruits, and whole grains, plus some seeds (like chia or flaxseeds etc) for extra fiber. Also, increase your water intake! <This message was edited>

Kuch off hai. Maybe do 1.5 of calories mentioned
06/03/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: So what should add for calories then? 🙄
06/03/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 194x1.5=291
06/03/2025, 5:18 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 291 cal. Right?
06/03/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 290-300 sounds realistic
06/03/2025, 5:20 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Sure

07/03/2025, 1:27 am - Taha Ahmed: Thank you so much!  
This new routine of waking up at 6:30-7 AM and sleeping at 12 AM is quite a challenge lol! Plus, managing my food intake without a proper kitchen setup is making it really hard to stay on track nutritionally. 

I can’t eat out a lot, so I end up skipping meals… it’s such a dilemma. Probably the biggest reason why my migraines won’t leave me. 
Hoping it gets better as I settle in slowly! 🤞🏽
07/03/2025, 1:28 am - Taha Ahmed: Noo, don’t be! 🙏🏽  
And you’re welcome! 
Hope my responses make sense. 
If there’s anything else, just ask us here. :)
07/03/2025, 1:44 am - PF - Asma Tariq: The real challenge is to wake up at this early. 🙌

07/03/2025, 8:53 am - Taha Ahmed: For me, the real challenge is sleeping early haha

I'm used to working late at night till 6 am! 

Now I'm waking up around that time 😅
07/03/2025, 8:58 am - Taha Ahmed: That's true. 

People are fucking evil (read Capitalists). That's all I'll say for now.
07/03/2025, 8:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Greed is the only thing they know
07/03/2025, 8:58 am - PF - Ali Hassan: The food is already so addictive might as well just put some cocaine in it
07/03/2025, 8:59 am - Taha Ahmed: Cocaine suppresses your appetite too so noooo, that's not helpful at all 🤣

07/03/2025, 10:33 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): maybe just a psychological thing
07/03/2025, 10:35 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then on top of this kal aftari krty huay my tooth filling came out n now on all liquids because just cant chew solids
07/03/2025, 10:51 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Yup kind of... It triggers my anxiety
07/03/2025, 11:18 am - PF - Asma Tariq: After Sehari 1-2 hours of sleep is a must. And same after iftar. 😣
07/03/2025, 11:23 am - PF - Dua Ishaq: feels like im the blessed one, im sleeping at 9pm to wake up at 4 for suhoor & sleeping again 5.30 to wake up at 10am for my work.. im just the most chilled one with this routine in my family i realised yesterday and now here too, I guess? 😜
07/03/2025, 11:32 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Lovely✨.
When you have 07:30-08:0am report time at work, then it's tough to sleep after the suhoor.
And sleep at the 09-10pm, I guess school time tak hi tha, decades ago. Lol. Aab Tou khawab hi ho gaya. 😂

07/03/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: How less sleep affects muscle growth?
08/03/2025, 12:02 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Training performance drops & post workout muscle recovery gets impaired 
When u r not performing well in the gym then you are not getting most out of your workouts n ultimately gains effect hoty hain <This message was edited>
08/03/2025, 12:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, even if performance doesn’t drop. 

You’re just less likely to build muscle when compared with someone sleeping better and doing the same stuff.
08/03/2025, 12:04 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes & if it stays like this for a while u get prone to injuries too

08/03/2025, 7:47 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: <Media omitted>
08/03/2025, 7:53 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay yes, you'll have to add oil separately (if it was used)
08/03/2025, 9:46 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I didnt use oil for it.But jus asking if we have to generally add to this macro calculation given in the app.
08/03/2025, 10:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did it have oil on top? Like they add to garlic naan?
08/03/2025, 10:08 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: No
08/03/2025, 10:08 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Still lets add 1tsp.is that alright?
08/03/2025, 10:08 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: On the safe side
08/03/2025, 10:11 pm - Taha Ahmed: Rogni naan usually has plenty oil in it (added when kneading the dough)
You can add 3-5g oil
08/03/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok
09/03/2025, 11:34 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Do ovarian cysts or hormonal imbalances make it difficult to lose weight?
09/03/2025, 12:54 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it can, esp conditions like PCOS can make weight loss more 'challenging' due to insulin resistance, increased androgen levels, and metabolic changes. These factors can lead to higher fat storage, increased cravings (extra calorie consumption), and slower metabolism, but weight loss is still achievable with the right approach. Prioritizing strength training, managing insulin through a balanced diet (high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats), reducing stress, and improving sleep can significantly help, plus supplements like inositol can aid in it too. 

You chose the correct word 'difficult'. It makes it difficult to lose weight, not impossible!
09/03/2025, 12:59 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Okayy okayy👍🏻
Also i was wondering something from past few days & i am very confused,
From almost 3 weeks i have been eating like very less maybe because of semaglutide or it’s the constipation, cramps i dont know the reason, and my weight was the same , sirf aik din thora kam aya tha the day i mentioned that i was able to make it out of my plateau,
09/03/2025, 1:01 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Then this week , for two days i ate aloooot mere hisaab se i didn’t measure amything , but i ate aloooot & us do din k baaaad mera suddenly 1.5 kg weight gir gaya after a whole month kaisay? Jab deficit mai khaya toh the scale wasn’t moving
09/03/2025, 1:03 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: And now everyday the scale is showing a new low, which i am very very happy about 🫶🏻 but just wondering whats going on🤔
09/03/2025, 1:05 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Will let taha answer that correctly but my take is there is always a “whoosh” effect with fat loss. You can be doing everything right and it wont budge. Youre holding on to water and then all of a sudden its whoosssh !! <This message was edited>
09/03/2025, 1:07 pm - Taha Ahmed: This drop in weight after eating more is likely due to temporary metabolic and physiological shifts rather than actual fat loss. When you're in a prolonged calorie deficit (esp with semaglutide suppressing appetite), your body may adapt by holding onto water weight and slowing digestion. Constipation is why your scale weight didn't drop (your GI/Stomach wasn't really empty). Eating more- esp. carbs- can temporarily boost glycogen stores, hydration levels, and even digestion (which slows when you're constipated) , which might have helped relieve constipation and reduced water retention. This can "whoosh" out excess water weight, making the scale drop!
This is why we never 'only' want to rely on scale weight for actual weight loss progress! It fluctuates a lot and is dependent on so many factors.
09/03/2025, 1:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You had water retention and when you had extra food you lost some water retention. 

Also, you mentioned you had constipation so that was impacting scale too. 

If you’re in a deficit you’re losing fat. Sometimes you just can’t see it
09/03/2025, 2:53 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 💯
10/03/2025, 12:48 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Aoa, plz recommend any good cereal for sahoor or regular breakfast option.thank you

10/03/2025, 1:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I have that daily.
10/03/2025, 1:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can also do the same thing with wheetabix.
10/03/2025, 1:13 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Okay.thanks.what about muesli
10/03/2025, 1:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That too.

10/03/2025, 4:38 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Okay cool, thank you!!
10/03/2025, 6:12 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Was the conclusion of our conversation the other day that Greek and Greek style have same macros and hence either work?

10/03/2025, 7:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Greek salt isn’t that high in protein usually. Greek yogurt is.
10/03/2025, 7:37 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Greek style yoghurt has that thick texture and some low fat but less protein

12/03/2025, 6:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes you can
12/03/2025, 6:35 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Wallah, aaj Kal hum saab ki eik hi tension hai bs, calories up and up 👀
12/03/2025, 6:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Literally, I was never conscious about my food choices ever. Especially in Ramadan. ✌️
12/03/2025, 6:42 pm - PF - Sajal: count me in too🥲🥲
12/03/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Maine to jab say deficit say maintenance calories pay shift kiya hay may to calories pori nai kr parha daily 300-400 reh jati hay 
At start I was excited that 400 calories kahny ko mile gi😂😅
12/03/2025, 6:44 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): being concious is not bad but is ki wjah sy agar apka relationship with food overall kharab horaha then thats bad apka overall mindset about calories nutrition n all suffer nhi hona chaheay 
You should be mindful about what you eat but keep it realistic as well agar kisi b reason ki wjah sy on a day possible nhi horaha to its alright ek din sy apki progress py kuch boht major difference nhi aany laga <This message was edited>
12/03/2025, 6:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): haha it will take a few days to get used to it just like it did when u first started with a deficit
12/03/2025, 6:49 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yeah and ramadan may time bhi short hota hay
12/03/2025, 6:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: You are really right.

I meant being conscious, good food choices. Like no deep fried or oily stuff. Rather nutrition rich food. 
And no blind choices at iftar.
12/03/2025, 6:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): liquid calories will make it easy for you to consume and hit daily caloric intake
12/03/2025, 6:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if saying totally NO to what you like is making it difficult for you then add some and manage your overall intake 
you already know how to adjust n all
12/03/2025, 6:51 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Exactly, when I'm on maintenance. I feel like bht zayda kha lia hai aaj.
12/03/2025, 6:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): keep it at like 80/20 or 85/15 for whole foods n your favourite foods
12/03/2025, 6:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hum sa Kahan ho pati hai "totally NO". 😂
Hum tou manage hi Ker rahay and it's good to learn.
12/03/2025, 6:55 pm - PF - Sajal: is there any specific reason that iam craving for sugar and fast food more in ramzan?

12/03/2025, 6:57 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Ramzan ma in most of the households table py esi chezain nazr aengi n jb sara din kuch na khaya ho to apka dekh k dil bhi karta hai

13/03/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I have been seen lots of reels on people discussing about sugar intake.They are like telling to quit meetha intake.So may i know if we like desserts, how much meetha intake is good.I mean whats the limit?
13/03/2025, 11:16 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): upto 10% of your daily calories coming from added or processed sugar is like fine which for many is like ~50g 
but keep in mind its processed sugar or added sugar not the natural sugar coming from fruits etc.
13/03/2025, 11:19 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: So its normal to have thora buht meetha thrice a week.These scary reel are what for then?
13/03/2025, 11:22 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): fear mongering for views because it catches attention, people share it n social media pushes it more 
sari views n sales ki game hai jitna viral utna paisa. There are a handful of people who actually care for people
13/03/2025, 11:33 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Hmmm
13/03/2025, 11:34 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok thanks.Thats great to know the reality behind all this.Sameet have you made any reel on this sugar intake thing yet?
13/03/2025, 11:38 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): probably he hasnt or maybe he has i dont remember though 
i have a video saved which is on this topic will use it to address this inshaAllah in coming days
13/03/2025, 11:44 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.Thanks alot.i will be waiting for that.
13/03/2025, 11:46 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I came across this randomly yesterday. I have oatmeal, 2 eggs and greek yogurt for sehri. https://www.instagram.com/p/DHEr7O6yXPa/?igsh=ZnhwbGM3YXVsbnht
14/03/2025, 12:11 am - PF - Ali Hassan: That's why i think its good idea to add protein as well
14/03/2025, 12:16 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
Is the macros fine for 2100 calories?
14/03/2025, 12:17 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): seems fine 
i would just like the protein intake to be around 130-140g
14/03/2025, 12:18 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok and what about carbs is it fine?
14/03/2025, 12:18 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): carbs and fats can be as per your liking once you hit your protein target
14/03/2025, 12:19 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
14/03/2025, 12:24 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah because that’s just carbs. Adding some protein and fats help make it more of a complete meal
14/03/2025, 12:30 am - Taha Ahmed: Unfortunately, social media makes it sound like sugar is the villain in a crime thriller, but in reality, it's just an extra in your diet. The limit is around ≤10% of daily calories from added sugar like Ali mentioned. But tbh, don't fear the desserts, focus on overall diet quality- if 80-90% of your intake is nutritious, a little meetha won’t sabotage your progress. It's one of our goals for this community coaching to teach everyone this, so everyone can enjoy a lil dessert every now and then, and that too GUILT-FREE. 
Enjoy it whenever you want, just don’t let it replace the good stuff!!!

16/03/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: <Media omitted>
16/03/2025, 2:45 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I founf this online
16/03/2025, 2:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ws. You need to track the individual ingredients before cooking. This includes chicken, cream/malai, yogurt, oil, and spices, etc.
16/03/2025, 2:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: Example (100g cooked malai tikka boti) might have:
Chicken (~80g raw) = ~130 kcal
Cream & yogurt marinade = ~70-100 kcal
Oil absorbed = ~50-90 kcal
Total: ~250-340 kcal per 100g cooked

The exact calories depend on the ingredients and portion sizes
16/03/2025, 2:47 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I have ordered it from a resturant.so how do i track now?say if i m eating 75g of malai boti.
16/03/2025, 2:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Track it the way I have shared above^ it's easier!

If you want convenience, just go to Quick Add option and add ~300ish calories
16/03/2025, 3:23 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: <Media omitted>

16/03/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Nida Umer: Hey everyone,
Back with another long msg. Taha loves these and begged me to write one (no exaggeration there🤪) 
This time, I am here to say good bye to this wonderful group. Not only the coaches but also the community. (Shitposting being my favourite and my go to place when I am sulking)

❓Reason for leaving you may ask.
At some point in time, my utility from the groups ended. That has nothing to do with the group itself!
It is completely on my inability to track and engage. The group continued to provide info in bits n pieces that I approached it in. 

😍I am still in awe of the coaches and their patience to reply to all people no matter how many times that same question has been repeated or even how basic that question would be.  They treat each and every person as a beginner and give them the same love, kindness and respect 🫡 Big Salute.

‼️Even with less engagement my takeaways from the community have been massive:
🔹understanding on how calories can pile on without us realising.
🔹understanding of how sleep plays such a major role in the bigger scheme of things
🔹understanding how movement is so so important along with strength training 

❤️My wins from being here have been:
🔹Understood my eating / indulging patterns after successfully tracking for a month.
🔹 Rejoined the gym after a year and successfully completed one month and still on it…( 3 days a week only- but still better than zero)
🔹 Incorporated increased movement in the form of a late night walk. Not targeting big numbers like Taha said, there is no award for reaching 10k - that was a great break to my mental barrier of an All or Nothing approach 
🔹 Lost 1.5 kgs ( in the very beginning - if u remember my first post) couldn’t lose more (again my inability to stay consistent with the deficit) HOWEVER i was able to keep the 1.5kgs off by being mindful.  I managed maintenance even when I was travelling for work and eating junk. THIS was a big win!
🔹Last but not the least, Non scale victory!! Many of my shirts which were tight got loose. A few clothes that I had tucked at the very far end of the closet came out and I was pleasantly surprised to try them. Ramzan did its share of helping with a non bloated tummy but nonetheless somewhere somehow this group helped me in want to do better and be better iA. ( This was the biggest ray of hope for me that there is still a chance i can improve further) 

💫 The best part of being in this community was knowing that you are not alone. On a weightloss journey, one tends to internalise a lot of frustration -  “Why Me” But being a Fomo member, you laugh at your shortcomings together, you lift each other up together and you cry together ( how the hell is 20g papri 200 cals😂 - or how you just ate all your days calories in Halwa Puri - Satyanas!) and then you all hustle on together!

❤️ I wish all Fomo members happy balanced eating. May you all achieve your desired goals iA. 

❤️I wish the coaches the very best. I applaud you in your efforts to build such a community to create awareness and help people. Topping it up with your sense of humour and on point sarcasm. Anyone is sure to learn while having a great time.

🙏🏻 Last but not the least, my apologies for not being able to stay long enough. But don’t worry, I’ll stay in touch and still eat your heads ( Sameet can relate 🙈)
And also - any future progress i make is definitely going to be coz of you guys. ( Ill keep you posted )

Thank you 
Over and out ❤️
Love
Nida Umer

17/03/2025, 12:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is something that needs to be consulted with a doctor.
17/03/2025, 1:25 pm - PF - Zarafshan Mushtaq: Any side effects??
17/03/2025, 1:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Again, you’ll need to ask a doctor. Not in my scope of practice as a nutritionist

17/03/2025, 11:19 pm - PF - Hina Faizan: Hey! 
I’ve started my workouts, but since my lower body is a bit heavier, I’m feeling some pain. Would it be okay to start with just one set and gradually increase over time? Or would one set not be enough to make an impact? Just want to make sure I’m progressing safely while still seeing results.
17/03/2025, 11:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Is that pain like due to soreness or fatigue or something actually hurts ?
17/03/2025, 11:55 pm - PF - Hina Faizan: I think its soreness
17/03/2025, 11:56 pm - PF - Hina Faizan: And I havent worked out in a while, ive started after a long time maybe thats why its a bit difficult
18/03/2025, 12:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then 2 sets should be fine but if it’s too much then you can reduce to 1 set.
18/03/2025, 12:24 am - PF - Hina Faizan: Okay

19/03/2025, 7:32 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: I made Greek yogurt just by straining khulla dahi for 24 hours. The liquid whey that's left over, is there any benefit to adding it to my protein shake? Prebiotics?
19/03/2025, 7:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll have some protein and nutrients.
19/03/2025, 7:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Impossible to know how much though
19/03/2025, 8:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: even if she weighs it?
19/03/2025, 8:19 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it's tricky to know the exact nutrient content of the liquid whey since its protein concentration varies based on factors like how much was strained out and the type of yogurt used and how it was made
19/03/2025, 8:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: Generally the leftover whey contains some protein, lactose (milk sugar- it's why it'll taste v sweet if you drink it directly), some minerals (calcium, potassium mainly), etc., but it's low in casein protein and mainly consists of fast-digesting whey proteins (whey and casein are two byproducts of milk protein). 
So it won’t significantly boost protein intake (you'll need lots of liquid whey to get even 20g of protein), it can still be used in shakes or cooking for added nutrients. And no, it’s not a prebiotic!
19/03/2025, 8:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Whenever I make cheese or extract whey like this, I use it in pasta sauces (it adds to the overall protein content of the meal)
19/03/2025, 8:23 pm - Taha Ahmed: Pasta sauces because it gives it a creamy texture

If you're lactose intolerant or have lactose sensitivity, this isn't ideal!!! 😋 Don't come after me if you do it!!! 😂
19/03/2025, 8:23 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay got it 👍🏻 thank you
19/03/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but then one question you shared a picture of all the vegetable sources of protein which had Greek yogurt 23 grams of protein per cup
19/03/2025, 8:25 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: so how can I know it if I am making Greek yogurt myself
19/03/2025, 8:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's store bought Greek yogurt/Greek style yogurt (they make it differently than bazaar ka khula dahi or what we make at home)

You'll still be making Greek-style yogurt at home, but the nutrition composition will be a bit different (depending on the source/quality of milk used) <This message was edited>
19/03/2025, 8:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: oh understood, thanks much
19/03/2025, 8:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: IMG-20250319-WA0017.jpg (file attached)
This Greek style yogurt has 23g of protein / 250g portion

19/03/2025, 8:38 pm - PF - Mahnoor Minhas: Reading all of this makes me feel like I have so much to learn. I barely understand half of what’s being said, and at this point, I’m just here pretending I do :)
19/03/2025, 8:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: We are still learning. Don't worry sweetie. 😊
19/03/2025, 8:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: completely get how you’re feeling- when I first started in 2009, I felt the same way. It took me years to learn (and even longer to filter out the noise). But the good thing is, you’re in a community where there’s no fluff or misinformation- just real, science based learning (like the actual science, not the Scaianceeee we see on the internet :p)

So take it easy, go at your own pace, and give yourself grace. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And even after all these years of learning and education, we’re still learning. 

You’ll get there too- one step at a time! 💪🏽
19/03/2025, 8:46 pm - PF - Mahnoor Minhas: Yes, and I’m learning that’s the best part. Even if I feel totally lost sometimes, it’s exciting to know there’s always more to understand. Knowing that even you took years to figure things out makes me feel way better. So, I’ll just keep going one step at a time !!
19/03/2025, 8:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: That's the way to do this! 🙌🏽❤
And don't worry, we are all right here by your side, to guide and provide support whenever/wherever needed! <This message was edited>
19/03/2025, 8:47 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: when I'm out on weekends. I find it a bit challenging to keep track dor my calories, but I try to stay mindful and save calories throughout the day to ensure I don't exceed my deficit. 

Would it be possible to create a rough estimate for the calories in common meals when dining out? For example, if I have a quarter plate of rice, how many calories would that typically be? Similarly, how many calories would a quarter plate of mutton, beef, or chicken contain?

I’d really appreciate your help in creating guidelines for these types of meals so I can be more confident about managing my intake even when I'm not in control of preparing the food.
19/03/2025, 8:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s difficult because it’ll vary greatly. 

Example; quarter plate can be different based on the size of the plate. 

Plus what else is added to it. 

Similarly, is the chicken fried, steamed, grilled? 

This is why we made the TRACKING CORNER where you can send us a picture of what you’re having and we can estimate calories for you (and explain to you how we’d estimate it)
19/03/2025, 9:07 pm - PF - Muniba Yousuf: I wanted to share a little milestone with you all. After years of thinking carbs were my enemies and being on keto,  and I’ve lost 2 kgs after joining this group despite eating carbs!

When I moved from Pakistan last year, maintaining keto became harder, especially when visiting my parents or hosting them. A single cheat meal would throw me off, and I’d struggle with water weight gain for days, which only added more guilt and stress. Even though I was working out and teaching yoga daily, I noticed I was gaining weight and, worst of all, my skin started reacting with acne from the extra fat in my diet.

But then, my husband started sharing videos from Sameet, and after listening and reaching out for guidance, I made some shifts. Even though I’ve been enjoying my favourite foods, especially carbs, I’ve still managed to lose 2 kgs, and I’m feeling amazing about it!

My progress may be slow, but what’s been truly rewarding is that my relationship with food has improved so much. I’ve learned not to fear food, and it feels empowering to enjoy meals without guilt.

Despite my doctors suggesting keto due to PCOS, this new approach has been a game-changer for me. I just wanted to share my happiness and progress with you all .

Thanks for the support! 😊

19/03/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Damn, I was hoping it would make my gut health better. Pretty useless otherwise.
19/03/2025, 10:10 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: I'm not lactose intolerant but I did put it in my protein shake and it made me super bloaty so I think it was a bit too much lactose for me
19/03/2025, 10:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Could be.
19/03/2025, 10:11 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: But is it ok to use the khulla dahi? Cuz it's much cheaper than store bought
19/03/2025, 10:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. It’ll just be regular yoghurt then. Not Greek yoghurt.
19/03/2025, 10:19 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: But I strained it for 24 hours and it's super thick like Greek yogurt usually is. So isn't that Greek yogurt, just thoroughly strained yogurt?
19/03/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, full fat Greek yoghurt.
19/03/2025, 10:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But isnt that also costly then? How much are you left with after straining?
20/03/2025, 12:10 am - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Quite a bit, I'll weigh it tomorrow and revert

20/03/2025, 12:34 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: It was super super thick and creamy <This message was edited>

20/03/2025, 12:38 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Just put a malmal ka kapra on top of sieve, put the sieve on top of a bowl, put the yogurt on top of the kapra and let it drain for 24 hours
20/03/2025, 12:38 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Ya but I think Anhaar is Greek style

20/03/2025, 8:15 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I have digestion issues so you recommended iso whey.I hope its going to suit me.
20/03/2025, 8:17 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: this just opens the group page
20/03/2025, 8:19 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Also i have another question regarding work out.I had a ligament injurt almost 10 years ago in my ankle.Obv. went to orthopeadics who were like its a permanent injury and i shall avoid any kind of exercise and stairs.But after 6 months i started physiotherapy which made it better.But my point is that wheneve i do tredmill regularly the pain comes back.With strength training i also get inuries like in my shoulder or back.So plz suggest what kind of workour is suitable for me.Thank you.
20/03/2025, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll have lower lactose so might suit you better.
20/03/2025, 8:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Long term you want to strength train and improve your joints and ligaments.
20/03/2025, 8:27 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: So how shall i start?like no. Of days in a week and shall i add cardio in the beginning or not?also have been doing yoga but it didnt help weight loss.Same is with pilates it suits me but dont know whether its an additive for weight loss.
20/03/2025, 8:28 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Also no kind of multivitamins which has zin c in them suits me.Thats why i was reluctant to start protein powder yet.
20/03/2025, 8:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No exercise directly leads to weight loss. That comes from your deficit (calorie intake). 

Exercise and movement is done for muscle, strength, endurance, joint health, ligament strengthening, flexibility, mobility, bone health and mental health.
20/03/2025, 8:35 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok yes of course calorie deficit is the main thing.So which form of exercise shall i start form and how many days a week?plz suggest.
20/03/2025, 8:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2-3 of strength training is a good starting point. 

You can also mix in some yoga and Pilates. In fact, Pilates is a version of strength training.
20/03/2025, 9:00 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Hmm.so lemme jus start with 3 days pilates session per week.is that alright?
20/03/2025, 9:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. That works too.
20/03/2025, 9:09 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Also how is brisk walk?
20/03/2025, 9:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For general activity? Great.
20/03/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: So for workout?
20/03/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Minimum kitni karni chiay per week?
20/03/2025, 10:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): a good point to start is just look at your current daily step count & increase it by 1000. Then keep increasing the number gradually
20/03/2025, 10:33 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.thank you.
20/03/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Is this the question from Muniba?

21/03/2025, 1:07 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: Thank you so much,I will check their page
21/03/2025, 1:34 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: Elite or hydrolyzed protein powder, what is the difference between them, plz explain
21/03/2025, 1:35 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Hydrolyzed is the purest form of whey &
dymatize elite is whey regualr whey concenterate
21/03/2025, 1:41 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: Sorry one more question, what is BCAAs , elite main high percentage hai & hydrolyzed main 5.5gms per serving.
21/03/2025, 1:42 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): BCAAs are Branch Chain Aminoacids 
U dont need to worry about BCAAs if you are hitting your daily protein intake target and that too mostly from animal based protein sources
21/03/2025, 1:44 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): BCAAs include 3 amino acids 
leucine, isoleucine, and valine
21/03/2025, 2:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And both will have roughly 5.5g.
21/03/2025, 2:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Hydrolysis is processed to remove all carbs, fat and lactose. So it’s just protein. Hence the higher cost. 

I only recommend it to those who are lactose intolerant otherwise regular whey concentrate works fine.
21/03/2025, 2:16 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d personally remove Jacked from this list ab.
21/03/2025, 2:17 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): since he has launched his whey protein ?
21/03/2025, 2:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors too.
21/03/2025, 2:19 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yeah i have heard
21/03/2025, 2:19 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): but popular brands ki sourcing theek thee meri last info tk but abi absolute latest ka idea nhi
21/03/2025, 2:21 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I am going to buy whey protein for the very first time which should i buy Concentrate or Isolate? Which one will be best for me?
21/03/2025, 2:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Are you lactose intolerant?
21/03/2025, 2:23 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: Ok, halal & Haram check ka koi issue
21/03/2025, 2:23 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: No
21/03/2025, 2:23 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I have never used an isolate. 

I have always used concentrate. 

So stick with that if not lactose intolerant.
21/03/2025, 2:24 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Any recommended brand from you?
21/03/2025, 2:25 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Well, the only haram ingredient can be the rennet used because that can come from beef, pork or artificial. 

Because of cost, most now use artificial rennet. 

As far as I know, MyProtein is Vegan certified so will be halal. 

Rule1 is officially available is Malaysia and so is certified Halal. 

Protein works is also halal certified
21/03/2025, 2:26 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Dymatize in 2015 issued a statement that they don’t use anything that’s derived from pork.
21/03/2025, 2:32 am - PF - Sumera Adnan: Thank you so much
21/03/2025, 3:06 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Yup I confirmed few months back they don't use any animal derived rennet

21/03/2025, 5:49 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Can diabetic people have honey or some other natural sugar in a very little quantity?
21/03/2025, 5:52 pm - Taha Ahmed: They can have it, of course, but I’d still recommend speaking to their endocrinologist. They’ll be able to give better advice based on blood sugar levels and their specific situation
21/03/2025, 5:55 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: I add just a half tsb to overnight oats for my father and he is diabetic but I know I if I didn’t make it a little sweet for him he’ll not eat it
21/03/2025, 6:08 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can try Sucral instead, he won't be able to tell the difference cause it's as sweet as honey or sugar

22/03/2025, 6:44 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: @923441183411 how’s ginnastic nutrition’s whey protein? Is it reliable
22/03/2025, 9:27 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No its not
22/03/2025, 12:51 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Generally anything sweet, nothing specific
22/03/2025, 12:57 pm - Taha Ahmed: Got it! Are these cravings happening at a specific time of day? After meals? When you're stressed or bored? Research suggests that sugar cravings can be influenced by habitual, emotional, and physiological factors (incl. nutrient deficiencies). Long gaps between meals can cause blood sugar drops, making quick-energy sources like sugar more appealing (we feel this urge to eat sugary foods). Stress and poor sleep can also increase cravings by affecting cortisol and hunger hormones. Low protein or fiber intake might be another factor, as they help with satiety
22/03/2025, 1:05 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Then what should we do to control sugar cravings
22/03/2025, 1:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Great question! To manage sugar cravings, focus on balanced meals with enough protein, fiber, and healthy fats to keep you full. Stay consistent with meals- long gaps can trigger cravings. Stay hydrated, as dehydration (thirst) can sometimes be mistaken for hunger. Prioritize sleep and manage stress, as both affect cravings. You can have sweet sugary desserts sometimes, but IF IT'S A HABIT, try swapping sweets for naturally sweet foods like fruit or dark chocolate. And if it’s emotional, recognize the trigger and find alternative ways to cope- like a walk or deep breathing. 
What matters is what works for you and what you can manage- what do you think might work best for you? <This message was edited>
22/03/2025, 1:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How to prevent bloating and constipation
22/03/2025, 1:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Keep yourself hydrated and increase your fiber intake (fruits, vegetables) and recognize triggers that cause bloating (foods, drinks, ingredients, etc.) 
For some it's gluten, for some it's lactose, and some have reactions to even fruits (possibly because of fructose)

These things vary from person to person, so there's no one-size-fit-all solution!
22/03/2025, 1:39 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok that was helpful
22/03/2025, 1:41 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Can u explain little abt gluten
22/03/2025, 1:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: What about it?
22/03/2025, 1:43 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Insensitivity  etc sources of gluten
22/03/2025, 1:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sure
22/03/2025, 1:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Gluten  sensitivity why it should be avoided is it ok to have Gluten in pcos as some nutritionist say Gluten free and diary free diet
22/03/2025, 1:46 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Also abt milk that's also lactose ? Milk to be avoided in pcos as hormones are injected is it true
22/03/2025, 1:46 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: As far as milk yogurt is also made of milk
22/03/2025, 1:47 pm - Taha Ahmed: So gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It's what gives dough its elasticity (how roti stretches when we make it?). Now gluten sensitivity (non-celiac gluten sensitivity) is real and it leads to bloating, fatigue, and digestive discomfort without damaging the intestines - but it's not as serious as Celiac disease

Celiac disease, an autoimmune condition, causes severe reactions where gluten triggers an immune response that damages the gut lining. A lot of people think they have Celiac but more often, it's just gluten sensitivity (explained above)

Some food sources containing gluten include bread, pasta, cereals, baked goods, and processed foods (unless you source gluten free products- which are readily available in the market nowadays) 

If you suspect sensitivity, try eliminating gluten and tracking symptoms to see if it makes a difference!
22/03/2025, 1:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: Like I said, these things vary from person to person. One person may find that gluten is affecting their pcos, and others might not. So it's not the gluten per se, it's the individual's body's response to gluten 

if it makes snse? <This message was edited>
22/03/2025, 1:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yes, it makes
22/03/2025, 1:48 pm - Taha Ahmed: No! That has no effect on hormones and you can have milk even if you have PCOS <This message was edited>
22/03/2025, 1:49 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohh that's a news for me
22/03/2025, 1:53 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Last 3-4 days i was having a 150g pot of greek yogurt, one slice multigrain and some peanut butter (natural). I used to get so bloated, it was almost painful. Today i had the same but i switched from a flavoured greek yogurt to a plain one and a different brand. Also had less amount. I feel sooooo much better
22/03/2025, 1:53 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: It was definitely the yogurt, maybe it was flavoured like vanilla, strawberry or maybe just the yogurt itself
22/03/2025, 1:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: It could definitely be the yogurt, especially if it was flavored- some contain added sugars, or thickeners or combination of other things that can cause bloating. Another factor could be lactose intolerance (even mild), as some people react differently to different brands? It’s also possible that your gut needed time to adjust to a new food, and reducing the quantity helped? 

Keep an eye on patterns- sometimes, it’s the combination of foods rather than one ingredient alone. Just staying curious help a ton!
Have you noticed similar reactions with other dairy products?
22/03/2025, 1:59 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: But yogurt do also have lactose then?
22/03/2025, 2:00 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes. Any milk product
22/03/2025, 2:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oh, and I’ve personally noticed that the longer yogurt sits in the fridge, the more bloating it can cause (for me). I recently stocked up on Nestlé and Anhaar Greek yogurt, and after keeping them for a while, I felt more bloated when I had them. Maybe it’s because aging yogurt continues to ferment, increasing probiotics (higher concentration of bacteria) or acidity? Or maybe it wasn’t as fresh anymore? And I had it without pairing it with any other food. Hmm...
Could also be portion size or something else, but it’s interesting how little changes make a big difference!
22/03/2025, 2:01 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, it is, unless it's made with lactose free milk!
22/03/2025, 2:01 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Yes could be
22/03/2025, 2:01 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So  for instance I am lactose intolerant  so milk butter  all diary products won't suit me ?
22/03/2025, 2:02 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: This conversation is reminding me of my post whey bloating, oh god that was intense 🤢🤢
22/03/2025, 2:02 pm - Taha Ahmed: Foods that's made with milk or has milk (cheese, milk-based sauces, etc)
Not butter tho <This message was edited>
22/03/2025, 2:02 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ahh I see 
I am getting alot of knowledge  from here
22/03/2025, 2:05 pm - Taha Ahmed: Ah yes!

I’ve actually experienced intense stomach pain after having whey protein first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, esp. after not eating for 18–20 hours. Thought I’d start my day with protein… haha, terrible idea!

I've had similar experience with ORS too once when I was extremely sick with a stomach bug- had to take pain killer inj!
22/03/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: No no I mean the whey after straining yogurt. That's mostly lactose na
22/03/2025, 2:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: So glad to hear that!
22/03/2025, 2:06 pm - Taha Ahmed: Oh, shit!
YESSS!
It's got the highest concentration of lactose in it 🙊
22/03/2025, 2:07 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: It was horrible
22/03/2025, 2:07 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: Generally post dinner and when I’m back home from work. 
I control my meals and everything throughout the day just fine. But dinner and post dinner cravings mess everything up
22/03/2025, 2:07 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Soo truee happens with me too
22/03/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I used to have my carbs on dinner instead of lunch that helped me
22/03/2025, 2:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Next time you feel this way, take a moment to write down what you're feeling, what's happening around you, and who you're with. This might help you notice patterns!

To me, it sounds like post-workday exhaustion might be playing a role- your body could be seeking comfort and energy after a long day. If it has become a habit that soothes you, then naturally, your brain associates this time with reaching for sugary foods. And if you keep avoiding it then you're going to want it more and more- so instead, allow yourself some calories from desserts. It'll make you happy. And happier YOU = healthier you.

I had a client who struggled with this, and when we did some 'Sherlock shit' on her habits, we realized it wasn’t just about cravings- it was a bonding moment with her partner after work (something she didn't want to miss). Initially she'd feel so much guilt, so instead of fighting it, we adjusted her meal structure so she could enjoy dessert together while still hitting her protein and calorie targets. She kept making progress without feeling guilt or feeling deprived!

A mix of awareness, small habit tweaks, and a bit of science can go a long way in managing cravings without guilt!
22/03/2025, 2:19 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: What's sherlock shit
22/03/2025, 2:20 pm - Taha Ahmed: Investigating what she was doing and why she was feeling the way she did! (read the first paragraph of the message) <This message was edited>
22/03/2025, 2:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How r the workouts structured mostly ? 
Cardio and strength training  ?

22/03/2025, 3:00 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: OMG. This is the same to me. Whenever I take overnight oats with whey. Or whey with longer gap in meals  This happens to me. Like today. I had overnight oats in sehri. And I'm feeling so weak since I woke up. 
Other sources of protein like eggs or chicken etc have no such effect on my empty stomach.
22/03/2025, 3:01 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Informative. I never knew these gluten sensitivity types.

22/03/2025, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: Why do you think you're feeling this way?
22/03/2025, 3:35 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yeah, it’s not always black and white. For example, I’ve never had issues with dairy and I’m not lactose intolerant. But with age and my medical conditions, I feel like my body isn’t producing the same amount of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose). I’ve noticed that if I have milk during the day, I’m fine, but if I have it closer to bedtime, it upsets my stomach- probably because digestion slows down while sleeping, making it harder to break down. And I've observed this only with milk, not cheese or yogurt.

Yike, I know. Lol!
22/03/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How can we eat unhealthy  food despite counting calories like if its a burger
22/03/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So bun is made up of maida and it has another harmful effects on health as well
22/03/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How can we eat junk in a calorie deficit
22/03/2025, 3:45 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: There are no "bad" foods
22/03/2025, 3:46 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: Simply by adjusting the rest of the day's caloric intake around it
22/03/2025, 3:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no food in itself if good or bad 
quantity in which you eat a food makes it good or bad overall
22/03/2025, 3:46 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Cholesterol and maybe other health conditions
22/03/2025, 3:46 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid: If consumed in moderation, those conditions can be managed
22/03/2025, 3:46 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Like maida sugar noodles
22/03/2025, 3:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): eat major of your calories from whole foods like 75-80% and remaining from junk or foods you crave for can be adjusted
22/03/2025, 3:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: None of those have any impact on cholesterol or other health conditions.
22/03/2025, 3:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Cheese ?
22/03/2025, 3:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
22/03/2025, 3:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Not at all
22/03/2025, 3:49 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
22/03/2025, 4:07 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Because it's third time in raw. Whenever I have whey in breakfast, specifically whey. I instantly start feeling lethargic.

But never happened this when I had have whey in noon, evening or night.
22/03/2025, 4:37 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
@60193244266  this one is whey concentrate?
22/03/2025, 4:45 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes its concenterate
22/03/2025, 4:47 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Can you give a very diff in concentrate and isolat why pls.
22/03/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): like how to figure out from the jar ?
22/03/2025, 4:51 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: No, who should have isolate and who should take concentrate?
22/03/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Isolate is only for people with lactose intolerance
22/03/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’ve never had isolate
22/03/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is the one I use.

22/03/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm having isolate R1 - the red colour jar.

I'm also not lactose intolerance.
22/03/2025, 4:58 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): then u should be fine with concenterate
22/03/2025, 4:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then you can switch to this if you want to save cost
22/03/2025, 5:02 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes Im have another one. Just finishing it 👀
Now I got to know the difference. 👍

23/03/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Count me in. 😂
One day protein intake is 107g
The other day 57-60g.
23/03/2025, 11:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: My protein intake yesterday was around 100
today it's hardly 37g
I was already not feeling well and now I have a full blown viral and a fckn migraine 🤦🏽‍♂

24/03/2025, 12:16 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I also had the same graph for protein. 
The last week of Ramadan is the same for all I believe. So much lethargic and yes with headache.

24/03/2025, 2:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Shouldn’t for 99% of people.
24/03/2025, 2:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: What do you mean by heavy?
24/03/2025, 2:06 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Heavy as in, I feel nauseated. It takes a long time to get that feeling out of the system too. <This message was edited>
24/03/2025, 2:21 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: Or maybe I should introduce it little by little. Maybe start off with 10g.
24/03/2025, 2:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Try having it with oats or in a smoothie.
24/03/2025, 3:44 am - PF - Sofia Tariq: Is sourdough bread is healthier than regular bread ? What is the difference between them ?
24/03/2025, 4:00 am - PF - Ali Hassan: More nutrients easier to digest, and fermented food is gud for the gut

24/03/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: How shall we know that we are lactose intolerant?Also have been seeing alot of reels and videos on anti inflamatory diets?What are these diets?
24/03/2025, 1:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if you have trouble digesting milk or milk products & if you have symptoms like gas bloating nausea diarrhea abdominal pain/cramps etc upon consumption of milk or its products then it indicates lactose intolerance

Anti-inflamatory diets are just another FAD !!
24/03/2025, 1:43 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: What does the term FAD means
24/03/2025, 1:46 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): A fad diet is a trendy or popular eating plan that gains traction for a certain period, often claims rapid weight loss but lack any scientific evidence or support
24/03/2025, 1:50 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okay
24/03/2025, 2:58 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Hello coaches, what is recommended weight to lift (dumbell) for strength training (4 days at home) as per the fomo training program?
24/03/2025, 3:00 pm - Taha Ahmed: It depends on your current strength level and how much you can comfortably lift while maintaining proper form for the given reps and sets in the training plans. Start with a weight that challenges you but allows you to complete all reps with good form. As you progress, gradually increase the challenge by adding weight, reps, or sets, or by slowing down the movement for more control (progressive overload)

Hope it helps!!
24/03/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: So as a beginner, who is attempting strength training for the first, what do you suggest?
24/03/2025, 3:07 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Or should I try it out and see my self how much i can endure?
24/03/2025, 3:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d personally say 3 days but no issues if you want to do 4 days as well
24/03/2025, 3:29 pm - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Then I'll stick to 3 days 👀
24/03/2025, 3:32 pm - Taha Ahmed: Do whatever you can stick to consistently without feeling like you're falling short or not doing enough. We don’t want that kind of pressure! So if following a 3-day plan allows you to do that, go for it!
24/03/2025, 6:29 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: 2.6 kg down in ramzan 🙏🙏 Only calorie deficit, that too i havent tracked but just tried to eat mindfully and my gym workouts.

24/03/2025, 6:38 pm - PF - Zeryab Hassan: I was looking at the conversation about the whey protein and I had to get one, I am confused about it. I don’t know if I am lactose intolerant or not.
24/03/2025, 6:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): do you consume milk & it digests fine ?
24/03/2025, 6:42 pm - PF - Zeryab Hassan: I think it has different signals, sometimes it is fine sometimes not, like if I take tea with milk it doesn’t feel good on stomach
24/03/2025, 7:01 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: congratulations
24/03/2025, 7:37 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Wow congratulations
24/03/2025, 8:40 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is GOOD progress.
24/03/2025, 8:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And otherwise? If you have milk or ice cream? Do you get an upset tummy?
24/03/2025, 8:57 pm - PF - Zeryab Hassan: Mostly I have an upset stomach , coffee and icecream is my on and off daily consumption. I don’t know if it is because of this or any other issues. I don’t get diarrhea easily , but I usually get constipated.
24/03/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe worth testing it.
24/03/2025, 9:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And going lactose free for a couple of weeks
24/03/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Zeryab Hassan: So should I avoid having coffee or ice-cream
24/03/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Zeryab Hassan: And should I get the lactose free whey protein?
24/03/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): just avoid milk or anything in which milk is being used as an ingredient for a week as sameet said to check if its actually lactose intolerance 
then we will proceed with any further action
24/03/2025, 9:52 pm - PF - Zeryab Hassan: Oh ok
24/03/2025, 10:05 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: When i take milk in seperate tea its fine.but when i consume only milk, i get nausea.Is that being lactose intolerant?
24/03/2025, 10:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Usually with lactose intolerance, you get bloating, gas or diarrhea. 

@923343773307 have you read up on nausea related to lactose?
24/03/2025, 10:08 pm - +1 (484) 597-9462 requested to join.
24/03/2025, 10:09 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: No.havent read yet
24/03/2025, 10:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That was for Taha hahaha. The research I’ve read doesn’t mention nausea as symptom. 

Also if you have lactose intolerance then it’s with all milk products. Even yoghurt at times. 

No just a glass of milk. Especially things like cream and ice cream.
24/03/2025, 10:18 pm - Taha Ahmed: The research doesn’t list nausea as a symptom, but I do experience it sometimes- along with bloating and cramps. That’s more due to lactase deficiency and having it on an empty stomach rather than the milk itself (at least in my case- my anecdotal evidence, lol 😋)

I've also noticed that when my IBS is triggered or my stomach is already upset, drinking milk can worsen nausea, bloating, and even diarrhea, leading to severe discomfort. But interestingly, this mostly happens when I have milk in coffee or drink it at night. When I pair it with something like overnight oats (with extra fiber and protein), the symptoms are much milder
24/03/2025, 10:34 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ice cream i consume once a year so didnt notice much.yogurt is fine with me though i eat it also less.the only milk product is seperate tea which digests well.
24/03/2025, 10:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then probably not lactose intolerant. But you can go with isolate if you still have doubts.
24/03/2025, 10:43 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: I have completed another month with fomo alhamdulillah.I have lost an inch almost from all measurements but staying same on scale.Energy levels are fine, feeling light while still enjoying food.Wanted to know from respectable coaches if we need to make any changes to my calorie intake?
24/03/2025, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can you make a detailed post with measurements and scale weight trend on Facebook. 

Only then I can give you proper feedback. 

Don’t have enough information here to provide constructive feedback
24/03/2025, 10:54 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Shall i mention measurements from where i started?

25/03/2025, 4:42 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Is it  true that we should do incline treadmill rather than running on it for fatloss?
25/03/2025, 4:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope!
25/03/2025, 4:47 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So what's better ??
25/03/2025, 4:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Fat loss is determined by your overall energy balance, not by whether you walk or run on a treadmill or if it's inclined or declined. Incline walking burns fewer calories per minute than running, but it can be a lower-impact option for those who struggle with high-intensity exercise

So what better? IMO, anything that you can sustain consistently while maintaining a calorie deficit through diet (will always be the biggest component) and activity

25/03/2025, 5:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think you really need to unfollow all your social media following 🤣

25/03/2025, 6:15 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): Hello I just joined this group today, I'm a little confused about how things work here, a little guidance would be really helpful
25/03/2025, 6:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The first step is going the the Facebook group and especially going through the guides (@923343773307 must have tagged you in it)
25/03/2025, 6:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hi Asma, happy to have you here!

I emailed you our Starter's Guide, which covers terms, conditions, payment policies, and more. On the last page, you'll find an Action Plan that explains how to get started- like joining our Facebook and WhatsApp communities.

Since you've already joined both, the next step is to check out the Welcome Post I tagged you in on the Facebook group. It has 5-6 steps to help you get started:

1. First, track your calories and macros (shared in the guide on Facebook) and share them with us in a separate post for verification.
2. While we review, go through the rest of the guide, which explains how the training plan works, how the community functions, and how to track calories/macros effectively (there's a guide that you can read for your own understanding).

Let me know if you have any further questions! 😊
25/03/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): Where can I track my calories? Is there any app?
25/03/2025, 6:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can use free mobile apps like MyFitnessPal or MacrosFirst, available on both iOS and Android

Hope everyone is having a good day🤩
I wanted to know how accurate are these smart scales?
25/03/2025, 7:15 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): They are quite accurate
25/03/2025, 7:15 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Omg🙊🤣
25/03/2025, 7:16 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Body fat percentage and everything?😭😫🤣
25/03/2025, 7:17 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No Body fat percentage reading on these smart scales isnt that accurate but weight is quite accurate
25/03/2025, 7:18 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Ohh ok ok i was wondering about the body fat percentage the muscle mass/ bone mass everything 🙊
25/03/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re only as accurate as a standard weighing scale. 

They’re accurate for weight.
25/03/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s it.
25/03/2025, 7:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: None of those other metrics are accurate BUT they can be useful if you’re just looking at a trend
25/03/2025, 7:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For example if it shows your body fat percentage went from 35% to 33% then it’s very likely that you lost some fat.
25/03/2025, 7:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just the percentage won’t be accurate.
25/03/2025, 7:19 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Ohhh ok ok😍😍
25/03/2025, 7:22 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Yeah i keeeep a regular check isiliye pooocha and muscle masss is excellent 💃🏻 bodyfat percentage is quite high but woh bhi pehle se percentage neeeche aagayi, & i am so happpyyyy todayy because i lost another kg💃🏻 in total i lost 3 kgs

Went shopping for kurta. Same brand as every year. L used to be tight. Now I had room in it, it was comfortable and now M is tight.
26/03/2025, 2:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s a great indicator of progress.
26/03/2025, 3:01 am - PF - Sadia Zakaria: Is there a correlation between fat/weight loss and (elevated) heart rate during exercise?
26/03/2025, 3:04 am - PF - Mehr Asif: what should be the water intake per day?  according to weight or thirst ?
26/03/2025, 3:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2-3 liters is good for most.
26/03/2025, 3:07 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really.

26/03/2025, 5:41 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay so i need a little help coaches….

i wanna lose belly fat like the one on the sides which is called as muffin top, i was on a mission to lose some body fat % so i started with the deficit 3-4 months ago so i have lost around 4 kgs in total till date, i have gotten somewhat leaner as i can see some muscle definition; the bicep triceps cut, the obliques but i still see the muffin top and it irritates me a little 

so my question is, should i lose more body fat %? Or should i start focusing on building muscle?
26/03/2025, 8:42 am - Taha Ahmed: Losing 4kg and seeing more muscle definition means you're already doing a lot of things right. Now, about the 'muffin top'- it's important to know that fat loss doesn’t happen in one specific area (spot reduction is a myth!!). Instead, your body decides where it loses fat first and where it holds onto it longer, which can be influenced by genetics, hormones, and individual fat distribution patterns (everyone is unique this way)

So, should you continue losing fat or start building muscle? Well that depends on your goals and how you're feeling. If you feel lean but still notice stubborn fat in certain areas, further fat loss might help- but at some point, getting leaner doesn’t always guarantee a ‘better’ look. Instead, shifting your focus to building muscle could be the key to changing your body composition in a way that makes those areas look more defined

A good question to ask yourself is: Do I want to get even leaner first, or would I rather start focusing on strength and muscle building while maintaining a lean look? There's no wrong answer- both can work, but the best approach depends on WHAT EXCITES YOU MORE and what aligns with your long-term goals. 

Let us know what you’re thinking!
26/03/2025, 8:43 am - Taha Ahmed: This is amazing, Haris! How are you feeling about this change since the last year?

26/03/2025, 11:03 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: I have 2 brands of greek yogurt in my fridge. One is a new one which i’ve been quite happy with. The other, my regular today i noticed had gone a bit sour. That got me thinking the new brand doesnt get sour, i’ve been having it everyday in ramzan and never felt that. Does it mean its not the real deal ? I notice it doesnt make me feel bloated also the way the old one does
26/03/2025, 12:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can’t say. Maybe it just has more preservatives.
26/03/2025, 1:42 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Maybe
26/03/2025, 3:02 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you so much!!!
26/03/2025, 3:04 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i am thinking to lose a little more fat, maybe just 1-2 kgs and then start focusing on building muscle and strength with that lean look! honestly this is exciting me more just by thinking about it!!😍😍
26/03/2025, 3:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can do both together too. Focus on your deficit but start training to start building muscle.
26/03/2025, 3:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ok done IA,
26/03/2025, 3:47 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I am just waiting for Eid, after Eid I will join the gym and then properly focus on the training program you guys have planned

26/03/2025, 7:28 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Estimated
26/03/2025, 7:29 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: It was homemade 
Made with chkn cheese potatoes and bread crumb for coating
26/03/2025, 7:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Difficult to tell. What what the weight?
26/03/2025, 7:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Was it deep fried?
26/03/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Air fried
26/03/2025, 7:52 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): around 200  
what do you say @60193244266
26/03/2025, 7:54 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: No idea 🤐
26/03/2025, 8:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, really difficult to guess without having a picture for reference or the size of it.
26/03/2025, 8:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It could be anywhere from 100 - 300 calories each.
26/03/2025, 9:02 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Thankyou
27/03/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Do u have workout plan for tummy? Seperate
27/03/2025, 12:01 am - Taha Ahmed: How do you mean?
Do you want to train your core? Or build abdomen muscles?
27/03/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Train my core lose fat
27/03/2025, 12:02 am - Taha Ahmed: You can train your core, for sure!
But you can't lose fat by doing tummy exercises (spot reduction doesn't work- it's a myth)
If you want to lose fat from your abdomen, you'll have to focus on losing fat from all over
27/03/2025, 12:05 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok I thought in the workouts there was gluten focused workout  so maybe core workout also would be available  separately
27/03/2025, 12:18 am - Taha Ahmed: Great question! So all ourm workouts incorporate compound movements- exercises that engage multiple muscle groups at once. These are essential for core strength because they require stabilization and activation of the abdominal muscles, esp movements like squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, and rows, etc., all heavily engage the core when done correctly

If your goal is to strengthen your core, progressive overload through these compound lifts is one of the best ways to do it. However, if you want to add specific core training (like planks, leg raises, etc.), we can include that in your plan

Now if the goal is to lose belly fat, it's important to remember that spot reduction is a myth like I said above- fat loss happens systemically, meaning YOU CAN'T CHOOSE where you lose fat first (or the most). Instead, focusing on a consistent calorie deficit, strength training, and progressive overload will help you lose overall body fat, including from your abdomen over time- this is where people lose patience because it requires consistency, lots of efforts, and time!!

If you're aiming for well-defined abs (say like a bodybuilder), that requires not just core training but also adequate nutrition to support muscle growth and fat loss simultaneously (think of it as body recomposition)

Whatever you're looking for, let us know so we can help adjust your plan! Or perhaps, we might just add a separate core workout plan alongside the other workouts. :)
27/03/2025, 12:22 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: someone asked me the other day how they could reduce belly fat. i told them spot reduction isn't a thing. so the lady told me that according to her bmi her weight is right but she still has a belly. 
what would be the solution to that.
27/03/2025, 12:26 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Understand will let u kno
27/03/2025, 12:26 am - Taha Ahmed: If her BMI is 'normal' but she still has belly fat, it comes down to fat distribution, muscle mass, and lifestyle factors. Strength training, a slight calorie deficit, and consistency with protein intake & activity levels will help with body recomposition over time

Also, BMI isn’t a perfect metric- it’s more useful for identifying obesity trends rather than assessing individual fitness. When I was super lean and lifting regularly last year, my BMI was 29 (overweight), but I was muscular and not actually overweight!
27/03/2025, 12:51 am - PF - Ali Hassan: I saw a reel about BMI
27/03/2025, 12:52 am - PF - Ali Hassan: That its flawed
27/03/2025, 1:04 am - Taha Ahmed: Bus yehi hai! 
1900s ka tool hai... when they used to categorize healthy and unhealthy people by their BMIs
27/03/2025, 1:05 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Mujy reel mili to i will share it it was informative
27/03/2025, 1:05 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How accurate  are the skinfold callipers
27/03/2025, 1:05 am - Taha Ahmed: Please do! It'll help the community a lot
27/03/2025, 1:08 am - Taha Ahmed: Accurate in what sense? Could you add some context to your question?
27/03/2025, 1:08 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: For measurements
27/03/2025, 1:11 am - Taha Ahmed: If you can use skinfold calipers efficiently, interpret the data accurately, and analyze the trends over time, then yes, they can be a reliable tool for assessment
27/03/2025, 1:12 am - Taha Ahmed: They're good for measuring body fat % tho! Not body girth measurements
27/03/2025, 1:19 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
27/03/2025, 1:27 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: https://youtube.com/shorts/VOuo_gHuj3g?si=FAMGXbi9kjI8NLVW
27/03/2025, 1:28 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: The reason her BMI is normal is because she has no muscle. So her body composition is messed up. 

What ever weight she has is fat. 
And therefore she has a belly. 

There’s only one fix for this and I’m afraid that’s going to take months. 

BUIDLING MUSCLE.

27/03/2025, 5:30 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Kuch asa hoga
27/03/2025, 5:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but need to see your portion to guesstimate calories. 

For the portion, I’d do more oil. 1.25tbsp
27/03/2025, 5:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Did you go through my reply?
27/03/2025, 5:38 pm - PF - Fatima Ahmad: Yes I did and replied you already.
27/03/2025, 5:38 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.I use very less oil for cooking.Like i might 1kg  chicken in 4tbsp oil.Thats y i added less oil.Will take pic of my portion at iftar and share.
27/03/2025, 5:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah then maybe go with 1tbsp.
27/03/2025, 5:52 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): So sorry to hear that you're not feeling well , Hope you get better soon.
27/03/2025, 6:33 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: What could be the reasons of stuck weight despite  calorie deficit  and workout
27/03/2025, 6:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Didn’t you just start?
27/03/2025, 6:41 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Just asking for info
27/03/2025, 6:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Weight can’t technically be stuck inf you’re in a deficit. 

If weight is stuck then you’re not in a deficit.
27/03/2025, 6:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: And what does it mean by hitting a plateau
27/03/2025, 6:49 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It doesn’t mean anything but most people use it when they’re referring to weight not moving.

28/03/2025, 12:25 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: i was insisted to eat everything and ate it
28/03/2025, 12:25 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: and the calories must be in the range of 2-3k
28/03/2025, 12:25 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: i am just assuming this
28/03/2025, 12:25 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: now i am already catching up on weekly monthly avg calories
28/03/2025, 12:26 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: adding this would mean really low cals to eat for the next few weeks
28/03/2025, 12:28 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Just having protein rich food at iftar invites. Or manage the iftar items into maintaince Calories. 

But yes it's very tough to manage in iftar invites.
28/03/2025, 12:31 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: bohat kohshish hoti hai
28/03/2025, 12:31 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: kept putting stuff in my plate
28/03/2025, 12:32 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: in this way i ate a quarter of club sandwich, half chicken roll, quarter puri paratha with butter chicken, half of slider burger and a few bites from dessert
28/03/2025, 12:33 am - Taha Ahmed: One meal (even worth 2-3k calories) won’t derail your progress! No need to overcorrect- just balance it out over the week. 
Maybe trim 100-200 calories daily instead of cutting drastically?
Or prioritize protein & fiber, and next time, plan ahead!!
We need to understand that social meals are about connection, not just food- so perhaps set boundaries, enjoy, and move on! 
And keep going!
28/03/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Eik din se kuch nahi hota. Jo ho gaya, guzar gaya. You enjoyed the food and dine out. That's it 😊 
Just try to be in deficit in the rest of  week days. Be easy! <This message was edited>
28/03/2025, 12:34 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: according to chatgpt
28/03/2025, 12:34 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: all of this is around 1200 cals
28/03/2025, 12:34 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: so 25% aur daal lo
28/03/2025, 12:34 am - Taha Ahmed: That's 1500kcals
28/03/2025, 12:35 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: 1600?

28/03/2025, 12:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: And remember, you are allowed to say no to people. Just because someone keeps forcing food down your plate doesn’t mean you have to eat it. 

This is where boundaries come into play. You can always tell people, no I’m done. I’ll eat if I want to.
28/03/2025, 12:36 am - OC - Muhammad Haris: actually i ordered a meal for myself, rhe sandwich…

28/03/2025, 12:44 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bolnay dou. 

Cause like Taha said, people will have an issue with everything.

28/03/2025, 12:44 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: So unko khush karna choro and apnay aapko ko khush rakhna shuru karain.
28/03/2025, 5:17 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: Hi @60193244266 ,
I have corrected myself, it was 13000* steps not 1300 on my work days. 
Plus, I am on 1gram metformin for pcos.
I am not sure what I can have for my meals.
Could you help me a bit for a start up?
28/03/2025, 5:19 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: How many meals we normally should be having for a healthy proportion? Should we be necessarily having snack in between 3 main meals?
28/03/2025, 5:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. How many meals you have is just personal preference. 

Anywhere from 2-5 meals based on how you like to eat is absolutely fine
28/03/2025, 5:21 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d start with tracking your current food intake and then we can adjust from there based on calories and protein
28/03/2025, 5:57 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: I am a mess at this stage😐
Eating all junk and fast food. So don’t know basically from where to begin🥲
28/03/2025, 6:12 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Start with more protein in ur meals
28/03/2025, 6:29 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: Well so thats the reason why I was asking for help to build up some knowledge and later I can be more help for myself.
28/03/2025, 6:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: U will eventually don't worry
28/03/2025, 6:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Start sharing wat u eat
28/03/2025, 6:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Weigh ur food
28/03/2025, 6:37 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Take baby steps 😊
28/03/2025, 6:44 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: So how does that works, I will weigh my food and it’s going to give me an estimate measure of calories?
28/03/2025, 8:40 am - PF - Ali Hassan: For example if u r cooking something at home weigh the ingredients individually including oil then track them in my fitness pal
28/03/2025, 8:41 am - PF - Ali Hassan: If u are not sure of something then send a picture the coaches will guide u
28/03/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Send it in the tracking corner group
28/03/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Fatima Ahmad: Thanks for guiding
28/03/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Ali Hassan: And always weigh the food
28/03/2025, 8:42 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Even if u didn't make it weigh it and send it in the tracking corner
28/03/2025, 8:43 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Welcome

29/03/2025, 3:29 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: how much weight loss is healthy in a week? if someone is losing 0.5 kgs in 4 days is it fine?
29/03/2025, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: It depends on the individual's current weight, body fat percentage, and overall goal and how much weight (from fat) there is to lose!!
29/03/2025, 3:31 pm - Taha Ahmed: A healthy and sustainable fat loss rate is typically 0.5-1% of total body weight per week, meaning someone with more weight to lose may see a faster drop initially due to water and glycogen loss, while a leaner person may experience slower progress
29/03/2025, 3:33 pm - Taha Ahmed: Now l'osing 0.5 kg in 4 days 'could be fine', but it’s imp to ensure the weight loss comes from fat rather than muscle or water

A few questions to consider: do you have a sufficient protein intake? are you incorporating strength training to preserve muscle mass, and avoiding an excessive calorie deficit that could slow metabolism and affect energy levels? <This message was edited>
29/03/2025, 6:16 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Which foods have magnesium in it?
29/03/2025, 6:16 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Does low vit d leads to hairloss <This message was edited>
29/03/2025, 6:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any deficiency can cause hair and skin issues. 

But more than vitamin d, low protein intake has these effects.
29/03/2025, 6:18 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: In pcos hairless is common symptoms?
29/03/2025, 6:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes
29/03/2025, 7:55 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: honestly speaking, I am afraid it’s most probably coming from muscle/water 😕 because I am not able to eat a protein rich diet neither am I able to strength train 

I have planned everything out and just waiting for the Eid festive to end
29/03/2025, 8:02 pm - PF - Anam Ad: Hello…posting it here because im unable to find home workout at facebook…its only gym workout there…plz anyone can help?
29/03/2025, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Once you open the excel sheet, it has multiple tabs in it. You can switch between the tabs.
30/03/2025, 1:36 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Hello... just wanted to ask which foods have iron and b12 magnesiu
30/03/2025, 1:36 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Food sources
30/03/2025, 1:43 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: That will be a long list. 

Iron is mostly all meats, lentils, fish and green leafy vegetables. 

Magnesium can be found in seeds, dark chocolate, nuts and once again, green leafy vegetables.

For B12, pretty much all of your protein sources including dairy.
30/03/2025, 1:44 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Thanks
30/03/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So for instance  if someone eats some sugary item or something from junk directly  I mean after waking up on empty stomach so blood sugar will spike at double rate

I heard if want to eat something sweet then first fill up with fibre and protein then carbs at the end and then  can eat something sweet that will not cause immediate  spike in blood sugar level <This message was edited>
30/03/2025, 2:23 am - Taha Ahmed: It's nothing to be concerned about unless you're diabetic
30/03/2025, 2:23 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yeah Blood sugar spikes shouldnt be a concern if u dont have diabetes
30/03/2025, 2:24 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: But insulin resistance  is an issue that i have have to keep by blood sugar level stable due to pcos <This message was edited>
30/03/2025, 2:24 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Apart from weight
30/03/2025, 2:38 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Remember u have bring an overall change with a combo of nutrition activity n all. 
its not just about the glucose spike in the morning or any other time of the day 

First calorie deficit then Eat overall more protein and fiber. Sleep enough drink enough water u r active too & then if u do eat sweets or foods u like then its not an issue <This message was edited>

So go ahead, enjoy sheerkhorma or sawaiyan or cheese anda paratha. This is peer-reviewed… by me and all the coaches here. 😉

Don't ask us about calories. Thx. Bye! Have a great Eid holiday. ❤

05/04/2025, 1:22 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: Does metabolism have a say in weight loss?
05/04/2025, 1:23 am - Taha Ahmed: In what sense?
05/04/2025, 1:25 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: I wanted to ask what science says 
People say their metabolism is so good they can stay lean/ fit till 40s and then after that their “metabolism” doesn’t support them and they can’t help with losing weight
05/04/2025, 1:29 am - Taha Ahmed: Absolutely love that you’re asking this, because “metabolism” is one of the most misunderstood words in the health and fitness world, and it’s high time we bust some myths!
So while metabolism does play a role in weight regulation, it’s not the ALL POWERFUL force many people make it out to be- esp when it comes to weight gain as you age, let's say in your 30s or 40s. Contrary to popular belief, research shows that our metabolic rate stays relatively stable from our 20s all the way through our 50s. What often changes is our muscle mass, activity levels, sleep quality, and eating habits- not the metabolism itself. As we age, we may become more sedentary, lose muscle (which is metabolically active), and eat the same or more despite reduced energy expenditure. So while metabolism is part of the equation, it’s not broken or doomed after 40. With the right habits- like resistance training, staying active, getting adequate sleep, hitting protein goals, managing stress, and being mindful with nutrition- we can still support and have a healthy metabolism and maintain a healthy weight, regardless of age!!
05/04/2025, 1:30 am - Taha Ahmed: Think of metabolism as a piece of puzzle, not the whole puzzle! 
Hope it makes sense?
05/04/2025, 1:31 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: oh wow this makes complete sense, thank you so much!!!

05/04/2025, 1:43 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: 6
05/04/2025, 3:36 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Latest research shows it stays stable till 60. 

The problem, as Taha mentioned, we become lazy A-holes after a certain age and so burn less calories. 

But good news is that ALL OF THAT is in your control.
05/04/2025, 3:37 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any chance you know how much one weighs?

Hello ….so i have almost been in my calories that is 1700 n protein should have been 100 to 110… 
But the carbs are 229gram…is it ok?? Or should I reduce the carb intake??
07/04/2025, 12:53 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fine if total calories are good.
07/04/2025, 12:54 am - PF - Anam Ad: Thanku so much
07/04/2025, 5:35 am - PF - Hifza Ali Jaffery: GUYSSSSSS!!!!!

I still cannot believe my eyes. I started FOMO weighing 112.9 kilos—the heaviest I have ever been. With PCOS, stress eating, and night shifts, I was on a straight road to extreme obesity. I tried every single thing in my power to lose weight, but it just wasn’t working for me. I kept gaining after each crash diet—keto, paleo, egg diet, juice diet, and what not. You name it. Then I came across FOMO, and behn ne jazbaat mein foran sign up kar diya. Wasted a month and did nothing.

Nine days ago, I actually started following the calorie deficit and macros recommended by Sameet and Taha. Just weighed myself, and it's 109 kilos now. I ate whatever I wanted in these nine days but kept my calories in deficit—and still lost 3.9 kgs.

Finally, after three years of struggling, I have a good relationship with food and my health. Words can't describe how grateful I am to you guys. You didn’t just help me lose weight; you gave me motivation, strength, and most importantly, mind positivity!!

The journey is long, I know, but I just wanna say one thing: THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!

07/04/2025, 8:53 am - PF - Zainab Waseem: Hi. I am 2 months postpartum and breastfeeding and taking around 1500 to 1600 calories per day. Exercise krney ka time kam milta hai because of toddler and newborn and studies and home all at the same time. Sleep is around 3 hours per 24 hours because of kids. Weight budge nai ho rha. I have been in calorie deficit before joining FOMO, ek mahina ho gaya hai. Zyada dieting krn to milk production decline ho jaati hai.
07/04/2025, 8:53 am - PF - Zainab Waseem: Please give me some advice.
07/04/2025, 11:08 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I'm so glad you gave Project FoMo a chance and more importantly took this step again for yourself despite the weight cycling after different diets. It's wonderful to hear you have improved your relationship with food and health and I wish you more success ahead! 🙌🏼
07/04/2025, 2:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ve answered yourself there. 

You can’t try to lose weight to fast, your milk supply will drop. 

Plus sleep is super lot right now so I’d say focus on being accurate with the calories and understand that in this phase of your life, weight lose slow hi hoga.

It’s a sign that we’re on the right track. 

Let’s keep moving forward.
07/04/2025, 2:56 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Wanted to share my progress for my first week. Starting weight was 16 stone 2 and today the scale shows 15.10- Total loss of 6lbs. 
The tracking has helped, below my calorie everyday, not hitting my protein targets. Increased my steps in comparison to before. 

What can i do differently this week as my fear is as quick as i’ve lost, I don’t want to gain or plateau 🙈
07/04/2025, 3:12 pm - PF - Zainab Waseem: I am just tired of people telling me I still look pregnant and not good at all. But thanks a lot.
07/04/2025, 3:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Focus on protein intake first. 
And try to hit your calories targets too (don’t stay 100-200 under)
07/04/2025, 3:29 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Ignore negative comments and focus on your temple (yourself). This body created a beautiful human that need you as there fuel. Embrace your looks, body and mind. This is coming from a mum of 2 who suffered from PND ❤️
07/04/2025, 3:32 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks @60193244266 . Will focus on that this week. I have been more then 200 under some days. Think i had a bit too much of
Kung fu panda syndrome (or kick ass) and really wanted to make a difference
07/04/2025, 4:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. 

And also, people will never be happy. I know from personal experience, people every time I lose weight and become lean, people are like you’ve become weak and skinny. 

I gain weight, and they’re like oh you don’t have six packs anymore. 

Like wtf. What do you want me to do? Become fucking Thor. lol. 

Similarly, Taha gained weight when he was recovering and going through Cancer and people started commenting on him gaining weight. Imagine. 

So, screw people and focus on what feels best FOR YOU.
07/04/2025, 4:46 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hahaha I will do all of that and more 🤣

07/04/2025, 5:15 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: I suggest an affirmation for today 

"Your body is not a problem to be fixed, it's a gift to be celebrated” 

Those who body shame  are A-holes.  So my affirmation today for those who do that 

“ put your ONGAL up your BONGAL and keep on running “

08/04/2025, 1:20 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Are smart watches accurate when it comes to burning calories?
08/04/2025, 1:20 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Just asking
08/04/2025, 1:21 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Also, strength training generally burns less calories than cardio or HIIT right
08/04/2025, 1:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope
08/04/2025, 1:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: No, it depends on the individual, their workout's intensity, load, overall training stimulus, etc.
08/04/2025, 1:25 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ooooh, ok makes sense
08/04/2025, 1:26 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: when it comes to strength training, I don’t burn a lot of calories (acc to the watch) like I make sure I train to failure and pick the weight that challenges me but I don’t sweat much and neither does the watch tells me im burning too much calories
08/04/2025, 1:27 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: I think the watch only picks up activity if you're moving around alot, walking, running etc
08/04/2025, 1:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Doesn’t matter. That’s not why we train.
08/04/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes of course
08/04/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I was just making sure im doing everything right 😅
08/04/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: makes sense
08/04/2025, 1:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You train because it helps you build muscle, strengthen bones and improve overall metabolic health. 

The calories are not important. You can add some cardio after weights if you want to burn extra calories (I never do 😂)
08/04/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahahahah ok thank you and i am sure i wont either 🤭🤪
08/04/2025, 1:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I covered this on my stories yesterday but I walk a lot between sets and that’s sort of cardio lol
08/04/2025, 1:30 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: Yeah, exactly 💯
08/04/2025, 1:31 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes I do too!!!
08/04/2025, 1:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay so here’s the thing. These smartwatches aren’t the most reliable when it comes to tracking calories- esp during strength training. These devices mainly estimate calorie burn using heart rate data, which works better for cardio-based activities where your heart rate stays elevated for longer. But strength training is a whole different ball game- it involves short bursts of high effort, heavy muscle contractions, and rest periods in between, all of which don’t register “accurately” on a watch. In fact, multiple studies have shown error margins as high as 40–70%, depending on the type of workout and the individual. Plus, the human body adapts- as you get stronger and more efficient, your body doesn’t need to work as hard to do the same workout (that's the human factor and I don't think there's any device/tool out there yet that can accurately track this without human feedback), so you might not sweat as much or see a crazy heart rate spike- but you’re still making gains. 

So don’t let the watch dictate your progress- it's great for tracking steps, heart rate, etc. but not how much you burn because it can't actually tell the whole picture!

08/04/2025, 4:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Hi,
I'm so much disappointed today by the behavior of people about health or their so called fittnes. The rigid mindsets. Today at my workplace meeting, there were a discussion about health and achi diet and all. I'm not a nutrition researcher, I know but I tried to tell people about proteine benefits and high caloriec food there. But people are stuck to wheat nhe khani chahye, bht dangerous hai and protein powder is very very bad for health. Sugar is causing cancer, tea is very much bad for gut. And I was like 🙄
Like, they all to me, tum junior ho so tumhe knowledge nhe hai aur humae Saab pata hai.

And I was like, Bhar Mai jao sb. Saaf Pani tum log office mai provide nhe ker sakty. Huh.
08/04/2025, 4:38 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: And 60-70% people were PhD Dr. In their own diff fields there. But hum ne new kuch learn nhe kerna. But juniors KO snub kerna hai. Huh!
08/04/2025, 4:39 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Long story short 
zindagi asaan karain or behs na karain isi zid ki wajah sy health ka bera ghark hua wa hai majority ka
08/04/2025, 5:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. This is why you just focus on yourself. 

People will come to you themselves when they see results. 

And then you can be like nahin nahin, main junior hoon. Mujhay kuch nahin pata 😂
08/04/2025, 5:06 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: You can’t ever change anyones mindset so let them be. PHD or not you can still be  a complete “ Jargon wanker” 
Just remember why we are all here. 
I work in the corporate environment and nothing or nobody can stop you using your inside voice ( mine is brutal) 🙈
08/04/2025, 5:14 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Hi, sameet how long it will take time to get on track
I'm unable to post on Facebook and Taha is also not responding is it there any issue or just need to take time to make it work
08/04/2025, 5:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What do you mean? Why can’t you post on Facebook?
08/04/2025, 5:43 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Very right. 💯

08/04/2025, 9:46 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’re likely not eating this many calories then. 

Have you been weighing food on a scale? How have you been tracking?
08/04/2025, 10:05 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: I'm tracking by fitness pal but not weighing
08/04/2025, 10:06 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: During رمضان I'm eating this or less
08/04/2025, 10:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then how do you know calories kitni hain? 
You’re just roughly ballparking it and that might not be accurate. That’s likely why weight isn’t moving.
08/04/2025, 10:07 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Than what to do
08/04/2025, 10:08 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Actually I'm having boiled egg with chia seed and 2 tablets spoan aots

08/04/2025, 10:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not necessarily. We don’t know the size of it.

We are all in the same boat and here for the same purpose. 
Its very overwhelming as its a big change as were taking control on what enters our mouth. Can’t weigh things on the go- no problems! Prep the night before. Reach out i don’t mind helping dude, i’m new to this too.

Tomorrow is a new day a new beginning, start fresh ❤️ InshAllah <This message was edited>
08/04/2025, 11:52 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I remember when I first joined Project FoMo. I spent a good amount of time understanding things because I knew what I will be learning from here I will be implementing for life. Took things one step at a time, asked questions for clarity, followed coaches guidelines and alhumdullilah one by one things fell into place. Everything started to make sense. 

The purpose of Project FoMo is to teach and empower us with the right tools and resources so we can take charge and better understand two extremely important aspects of our lives, nutrition and fitness. Believe me and when I say this, I have benefitted not just physically but mentally as well from this community. Saw the same affirmations from others in the community.

You will have to put in the effort from your end if you want to see results. It will be worth it in the end 👍🏼
09/04/2025, 12:13 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: We have all been victims of fad diets or old desi “tootke” which  actually may of worked for a nano a second.  I know that i certainly have. 

@Sameet and his Insta reels intrigued me to give this group a go. My first thoughts were this Nutty (but beautiful) man has actually got a point in his trail of thought and with such passion. 

You don’t get nothing in life without efforts or a goal. 

On another note: 
My husband body shamed me today by making a passing comment of “ Jitni lambay, utni churaye” 
(I wanna push him down the stairs 🥊)
09/04/2025, 12:20 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: If you have taken the initiative to start then fully commit hojaen and try it for a few months. I know it's hard with life and everything. I'm a single mom of a toddler, I work full time, so I know how hard things can be. But at the end of the day, if you're not happy or satisfied with the way you look or feel and it affects your mental health then the best thing would be to take care of yourself by doing this. This is a form is self love which is so important. It's difficult at first to track then you get used to it. Then it feels weird when you don't track it lol.
09/04/2025, 12:32 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Rightly said. 💯
09/04/2025, 12:35 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Your diet, it's nutrition has so much affect on your mental health. And I have learnt this from this community. From the coaches and the members.

But this effort and learning is so worthy man. ✨

09/04/2025, 11:53 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: if I don’t have the specific machine in the gym, should I edit in the training program and change the exercise?
09/04/2025, 11:54 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: (obviously in the copy of training program)
09/04/2025, 12:04 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes if you dont have a machine available in the gym thats written in plan then we can look for alternatives 
which machine are you talking about ?
09/04/2025, 12:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you, i will just search up the alternative
09/04/2025, 12:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: gym doesn’t have lying leg curl
09/04/2025, 12:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: so I can do Nordic hamstring curl right?
09/04/2025, 12:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): do you have a seated leg curl for hamstrings ?
09/04/2025, 12:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: leg extension machine right?
09/04/2025, 12:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes
09/04/2025, 12:08 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I did hip thrust instead of lying leg curl, even though I know it’s not hamstring focused 🫣
09/04/2025, 12:09 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: next time will do this
09/04/2025, 12:09 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): no no seated leg curls for hamstrings
09/04/2025, 12:09 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: noo

09/04/2025, 4:51 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima requested to join.
09/04/2025, 5:21 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Hellooo everyone 🙋🏻‍♀️
I just rejoined my gym today, feeeling super fresh😍
Just had a question, i have always used adjustable dumbells for home workouts and even in the gym i start my workout with a pair of dumbells following a YouTube video of 40-45 minutes , and then i go to the machines like leg press, hip abduction and other upper body machines,
But my trainer told me k machines pe 80% support humein un machines ka hota hai so uska itna faida nai 😐 dumbell workout truly helps,
09/04/2025, 5:25 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: I joined after almost 2 months, so i was wondering, should i follow the same workout routine, like 45-50 minutes dumbell workout (total body) and then i can use the machines ? 
If yes then, total body workout k baad which machines i am supposed to use? Again i will do a complete total body session? First i will use all the upperbody machines and then lower body?
09/04/2025, 5:28 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: I hope i am making sense 😭
09/04/2025, 5:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I don’t think that’s true, I mean yes when you use machines, it does support you but it also targets proper muscle groups because your posture and technique is proper 
The thing is wether you use dumbbells or machines, you should always challenge yourself, the weight should be good enough and you should focus on progressive overload (gradually increase resistance through increasing sets/ reps/ weight)
09/04/2025, 6:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Main jo pure workout hi almost machines pay karta hoon hahahaha
09/04/2025, 6:07 pm - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Hahahah uski baaat pe mere mind mai aaap hi aa rahay thay🤣
09/04/2025, 6:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your body doesn’t know if you’re on a machine or using DBs. 

Muscles ki ankhain nahin hain. They just feel the load / tension. 

And woh kisi tarah bhi aa sakhta hai.

09/04/2025, 11:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): u dont have to log for a boiled egg alag sy
just log as whole egg & 1 whole egg is 70-75 calories 

if u had total of 4 eggs then just log 4 whole eggs <This message was edited>
09/04/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: 😂😂😂 no i had 2. But yesterday i made omelette and today boiled so i was wondering about calories difference
09/04/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: Thankyou
09/04/2025, 11:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s the same. The only difference is the oil used for an omlette.
09/04/2025, 11:50 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So wether eat boiled fry omellete we have to log as whole eggs?
09/04/2025, 11:50 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
10/04/2025, 12:19 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Just an idea. You can readily buy canned chickpeas. Drained is about 250g. Spray with frylight and add any powdered flavor on them (crushed chili, chaat masala, salt).

Put them in the air fryer for about 15 minutes. Great snack and store well in tight air container.

10/04/2025, 1:33 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Just a guess was the kale chanay from a brand called “Heera”. If so, wouldn’t trust there nutritional value or there sell by dates 😬
10/04/2025, 1:39 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Same i don't trust these desi brands
10/04/2025, 3:29 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: For whom bulking and cutting is for ? 
Sculpting /toning is the same thing ?
10/04/2025, 3:31 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sculpting and toning aren’t a thing.
10/04/2025, 3:32 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Bulking is used to refer to a period of tone when someone is focusing on building muscle and gain weight to support that process. 

Cutting is when someone is trying to lose fat and lose weight in a way to support that process.
10/04/2025, 3:33 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Cutting is when someone try to lose weight and  fat while maintaining  muscle mass ?
10/04/2025, 3:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup 👍🏼
10/04/2025, 3:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s just a bodybuilder’s way of saying fat loss.

10/04/2025, 12:05 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Why has almond milk become such a thing ? It’s lower calorie?
10/04/2025, 12:16 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because of many people not wanting to consume dairy. 

Moral reasons or lactose intolerance. 

Calorie reasons too.
10/04/2025, 1:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Had 3 chkn low fat sausages 
Boiled then weighed it so cooked it was 95gms

This seems fine
10/04/2025, 1:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You could just make this entry. Especially if you use it later too.
10/04/2025, 1:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Do these packaged items  contain trans fat?
10/04/2025, 1:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Worried abt that
10/04/2025, 1:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Usually they don’t.
10/04/2025, 1:49 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yeah not mentioned here too
10/04/2025, 2:15 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: <Media omitted>
Hi everyone, I hope everyone is doing good. I’m kashaf new in this group and journey and these calculations have been recommended to me I want to ask should i calculate the food amount before or after cooking? I have observed my protein intake is very low so i will focus on this more so does these types of protein options are good? 100 g per day a bit challenging.

10/04/2025, 2:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I feel like that mango protein is going to be delicious hahaha
10/04/2025, 2:18 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: Maybe will try and share the review☺️
10/04/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: And in meat options i like to eat chicken but my doctor said to stop eating chicken and eggs because of PCOS conditions so should I avoid completely or i can take an specific amount?
10/04/2025, 2:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t listen to your doctor for nutrition advice.
10/04/2025, 2:23 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Same i was told but it doesn't matter at all 
Doctors like to cut certain food groups
10/04/2025, 2:24 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: Ok thank you.

10/04/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: What is good to get rid of feeling bloated? I’m within calorie count but feel sluggish
10/04/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I'm not sure meri kidneys isko kese handle krtin hain
10/04/2025, 9:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That isn’t linked to creatine though. I haven’t stopped creatine for 12 years
10/04/2025, 9:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nothing. Just get a good night of sleep.
10/04/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How you kidneys handle proetine powder then?
10/04/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: Pakistan a ky ek dafa full blood work krwao ga then i am thinking of taking this kio ky ab to brain fog bhi start ho gae hai 😭

10/04/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: I think sameet can explain better
10/04/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Then I'm sure kidney stones will be linked to some other thing. Genetics bhi hota yeh.
10/04/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Then kidney or creatine Ka link kaisay hai? <This message was edited>

10/04/2025, 9:17 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: It wasn't because of protein powder... I think i was eating too much saag or palak 😂😂
10/04/2025, 9:17 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: I’m vitamin D deficient and low folate levels. Started taking both supplements this week. Would that cause it?
10/04/2025, 9:17 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: MashaaALLAH, Bhai 10 Saal  wali baat bht out dated ho chuki.

10/04/2025, 9:19 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Palak Saag, you gave answer by yourself Bro :p

Wesay I'm amused, villages mai itna Saag khaya Jata hai even in Punjab but oun KO stones nhe hotay. Why? Kuch confusing hai.

10/04/2025, 9:27 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Massively
10/04/2025, 9:27 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: That totally makes sense.
10/04/2025, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can be a million things. Is it just today?
10/04/2025, 9:31 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Yeah today mainly. I am on 2 capsules a week of 20,000iu of vitamin D for 7 weeks. I took the 2nd dose today and feel crap.

10/04/2025, 9:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Probably not linked to that.

10/04/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Fabha Murtaza: Hiya! Which protein powder is the best? I have never used them before and just wanted to ask for recommendations. Thanks. 😁
10/04/2025, 10:21 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Hy my protein goal is 102 how many eggs (whole eggs) are allowed to eat to full fill protein requirements cuz I don't wana eat chicken or we can say I just want a quick solution
10/04/2025, 10:21 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: @60193244266
10/04/2025, 10:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just eggs? One egg is 6g protein and 70 calories. 

You won’t be able to just eat eggs for protein. And nor do I recommend eating 17-20 eggs daily
10/04/2025, 10:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: They’re all the same. Just get a high quality trusted brand.
10/04/2025, 10:23 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: And plz tell me I fell bloated and gave stomach swelling gut issues what to add in food and what to substruct
Suggest a good protein powder
10/04/2025, 10:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just did.
10/04/2025, 10:24 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Eggs for protein, and fruits veggies and bread for fiber
10/04/2025, 10:27 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: ?
10/04/2025, 10:29 pm - PF - Fabha Murtaza: Some of them have a lot of chemicals or oils which I want to avoid. Are there any clean protein powders that you could suggest? Thanks.
10/04/2025, 10:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): whey protein doesnt have oil or any such chemicals you are referring to 
preservaties or flavors arent harmful at all rest is just whey protein extracted from milk
10/04/2025, 10:32 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You can opt for whey like MyProtein, Rule1, Kevin Levrone, Dymatize, BPI
10/04/2025, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll have 17 eggs daily?
10/04/2025, 10:39 pm - PF - Fabha Murtaza: Thanks
10/04/2025, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just wanted to offer some clarity on chemicals.
10/04/2025, 10:42 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: What did u eat today?
10/04/2025, 10:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
These are all the chemicals in a blueberry.
10/04/2025, 10:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: <Media omitted>
And this is a chemical structure. 

This is what your body recognizes. 

It can’t tell if this chemical was made in a lab or inside of a tree.
10/04/2025, 10:47 pm - PF - Fabha Murtaza: Thanks for this. Makes much more sense when thinking of chemicals. ☺️
10/04/2025, 10:55 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Nope but plz tell what and how to devided than if not
10/04/2025, 10:55 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s for you to decide. You the calorie tracking apps and input what you’re eating. Then we can make adjustments.
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Ok
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How many eggs can I eat in a day ?
Despite having pcos ?
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: And what if I incorporate protein powder
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can.
10/04/2025, 10:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 4-5 isn’t an issue.
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Per day ?
10/04/2025, 10:57 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Including yolk ?

10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Any of these work.
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Whey protein doesnt come with a specification that a certain one is for PCOS and vice versa
10/04/2025, 11:00 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohkay.... but in pakistan it's very hot 
Anday ki taseer garam  hoti hai
10/04/2025, 11:01 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Digestion issues hojaty then
10/04/2025, 11:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Taseer doesn’t exist. It’s a made up thing.
10/04/2025, 11:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Hahaha another myth 
esa kuch nhi hota
10/04/2025, 11:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I used to eat 6-7 eggs for breakfast lol 

For 4 years in PAKISTAN. Woh bhi Karachi.
10/04/2025, 11:02 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohh
10/04/2025, 11:04 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: I just wanna put it out there that I have pcos and I have 1 whole egg in breakfast and then add egg whites of like 4 eggs and egg white is just 25 calories with 5g of protein so if you want to eat eggs but don't want it to be too high in calories you guys could do that as well. Just a suggestion. 😊
10/04/2025, 11:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. Absolutely. 

But one small correction. One egg white is around 17 calories and 3-3.5g protein.
10/04/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: Oh ok. I get the egg whites in a carton and it has those calories and protein. My bad.
10/04/2025, 11:05 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: And also chicken mai hormones injected hotay hain?
10/04/2025, 11:06 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So that also doesn't matter in pcos 
Like I do eat chicken
10/04/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ahhh yeah then it’s fine.
10/04/2025, 11:06 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: But my doc says limit the portion
10/04/2025, 11:06 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Every thing have hormones veggies fruits kuch nhi hota is sy
10/04/2025, 11:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Your doctor isn’t an expert in nutrition.
10/04/2025, 11:06 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yess true har cheez mai they inject
10/04/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ahahahay yes yes
10/04/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: Tbh I eat everything and I've lost weight in the past with pcos. I do believe that strength training along with calorie deficit helps a ton. You can eat anything tbh. I've had fast food in the past like twice or thrice a week  but still lost weight since it was within the calorie deficit.
10/04/2025, 11:07 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: And also I have heard that iss time pr ye khaye tou nutrition  absorption  zyada hogi 
Until and unless we r eating in a deficit  it doesn't matter right
10/04/2025, 11:08 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Woww woww that's amazing 👏
10/04/2025, 11:10 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: And almonds if we eat soak karke absorption achi hoti hai
10/04/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Oh my ....after listening all this i did so strict diet in past cutting out sugar bread milk just becz of these myths
10/04/2025, 11:11 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: You go Girl 🥊. Having PCOS is shit, but hearing positive things like that is super reassuring.
10/04/2025, 11:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. No need for this too.
10/04/2025, 11:12 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: My family didn't believe me either until I lost the weight and then they were like omg how did you do that. Mere parents to ab b kehte ha k ye totka kro wo totka kro lol. Totkon se humare log bahir he nai ate.
10/04/2025, 11:13 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Sab totke dhoondty and shortcuts🤣🤣
10/04/2025, 11:13 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I also have pcos yess it's challenging but not possible
Belly fat goes in the end 🥲 requires alot of patience
10/04/2025, 11:14 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: Thank you. Bas consistent rehna ha. Give up nai karna ha. I know with pcos we can get tired easily and feel like we don't have as much energy.
10/04/2025, 11:21 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: After how much time we should check our inches ?
10/04/2025, 11:22 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 1000000000% agreed. I'm on the same boat ladies. The fatigue we are facing. But it feels so happy watching that we are progressing on our health. ❤️
10/04/2025, 11:24 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How do you guys structure your workouts
I mean  what's the strategy?
10/04/2025, 11:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You can do weekly to maintain a log & see how you are progressing <This message was edited>
10/04/2025, 11:27 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Alright 👍 
You guys are so helpful 
All myths are being clear and i am learning how to track calories
10/04/2025, 11:27 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): workouts are available in the FB group 
but if you are asking i genrl then startegy is to keep it simple and effective by pushing yourself close to failue in sets and managing the workout volume properly to ensure good recovery after workout
10/04/2025, 11:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can check it weekly. I personally do it once in 3 weeks. 

And you likely won’t see changes everytime because of things like menstrual cycle and bloating. 

So look at long term trends.
10/04/2025, 11:28 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yes truee all that factors effect too
10/04/2025, 11:29 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: And excersize selection?
Yeah asking in general as I always  end up having confusions that what kind of workout to follow how much rest between the sets and how many excersize to do for certain muscle group and all
10/04/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then follow the workouts in the community.
10/04/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why complicate it when we’ve done the work for you lol.
10/04/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Rest between sets = 2-4 minutes
10/04/2025, 11:30 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Sorry 😅
10/04/2025, 11:33 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: Is there an app that you can use to track your body measurements?
10/04/2025, 11:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For weight you can use LIBRA.
10/04/2025, 11:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not sure if there’s one for measurements 

But there’s a sheet in the community that you can use.
10/04/2025, 11:34 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: That helps. Thank you.
10/04/2025, 11:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I just write in my notes
10/04/2025, 11:52 pm - PF - Romaisa Khan: I do too but I hate going back and forth to see if there's any progress lmao
11/04/2025, 1:42 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thank you for the prompt. Still yet to do that.  I can see that being a great insensitive in so many ways.
So far i can feel one less roll when i put my seatbelt on in the car! Sucess? I think so 😬
11/04/2025, 1:45 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You don’t have to track measurements. 

I barely ever check measurements. Scale weight is all the data I need to understand trends.
11/04/2025, 1:48 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: I suppose with scale success comes most of all  a “feel good factor”. Loving your body and your self is an art to be perfected ❤️
11/04/2025, 2:17 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: I only wanna do it because I'm tryna fit into my old clothes lmao. So measuring would make me feel better in some way I guess but not necessary. I'm just trying to cope lol.
11/04/2025, 2:18 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: It's the best way to check ✔️ when fitted clothes r fitting comfortably
11/04/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: Yeah. Do you weigh yourself weekly or biweekly? Cuz I've heard you should do it everyday which could be unrealistic in some situations. So idk
11/04/2025, 2:25 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yeah normally I weigh myself every 10 days
11/04/2025, 2:26 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: What i do for motivation  is if some of my  clothes r still not comfortably fit so I give myself a goal k isme bhi fit hona hai
And that's really motivating trust me
11/04/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: That's really good. I'll try that.
11/04/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Hope that works for u as well!
11/04/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: Thanks.
11/04/2025, 2:27 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Welcome
11/04/2025, 3:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. This is accurate. Daily tracking is great and that’s what we recommend. 

The goal isn’t to see changes daily. The goal is to be able to calculate average weight for the week and then compare average to average of next week.
11/04/2025, 3:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: In that you don’t have to do it daily, we all forget sometimes but as long as you check 3-4 times a week, it’s good enough.
11/04/2025, 3:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus, you should always ONLY check your weight in the morning before you EAT or DRINK anything.
11/04/2025, 3:06 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: I'll try to weight myself everyday then. I tried it in the past but some days it was demotivating when one day you're -3 pounds and the next day you're +3 lmao.
11/04/2025, 3:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is why we take averages. And over time it’ll help you understand your body better and improve your relationship with scale weight.
11/04/2025, 3:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also, there is some cool research that shows people who weigh themselves daily are better at managing their weight in the long run.
11/04/2025, 3:33 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: Thank you for explaining this. I get it now.
11/04/2025, 4:39 am - PF - Ali Hassan: https://amzn.eu/d/a4Kp23X

This can be helpful
11/04/2025, 4:39 am - PF - Ali Hassan: It connects to an app and stores the measurements... I bought a knock off from temu
11/04/2025, 5:05 am - PF - Romaisa Khan: This is very cool. Thanks.
11/04/2025, 1:09 pm - PF - Atika Abbas requested to join.
11/04/2025, 4:15 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I’ve heard many people say that green juice is very beneficial, since we can’t eat that amount of veggies we should take juice out of it and drink it everyday??
11/04/2025, 4:16 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: similarly what about people who make so many different kinds of weird tasting drinks, like they add mint, garlic, lemon juice and some spices and then drink it to stay healthy? 

I know our health is dependent on our overall diet and lifestyle but should a person incorporate such things in their diet?
11/04/2025, 4:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): extracting juice & blending veggies are different 
blending sy to nutrients n fiber milyga but juice sy fiber nhi milna or nutrients bhi 
 blended veggies ko peena bhi boht mushkil hai So its always better to eat veggies
11/04/2025, 4:21 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): If your overall diet is good then you dont have to do any such thing
11/04/2025, 4:21 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: yes yeh tou hai taste compromise hojata hai, lekin mei waisay blending ki he baat kr rahi thi ku keh uss mei fibre rehta hai
11/04/2025, 4:21 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you 🙏
11/04/2025, 4:28 pm - PF - Ayesha Binte Rashid left
11/04/2025, 4:35 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Stir frys are good to add more vegetables. Broccoli is great and versatile. It doss baffle me on how anyone can drink a green juice 🤷 <This message was edited>
11/04/2025, 4:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahaha i have seen so many people who drink it everyday now
11/04/2025, 4:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but yes I personal love stir fryers/ sautéed veges
11/04/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): unka dimagh kharab hai !! 
veggies wo bhi blended🤮
11/04/2025, 4:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: they say jeenay kay liye khatay/ peetay hain🤪
11/04/2025, 4:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Jeetay kay liye insaan ki tarah kha lain. I just made Chinese and that had 6 different vegetables totalling 200g
11/04/2025, 4:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahaha sahi baat hai I agree
11/04/2025, 4:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: btw is this recipe on ur fatafat meals on insta?
11/04/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Scale is showing a 1/2 lb loss in the last 5 days. Bit deflated as this week i have put in more effort in comparison to last week. I haven’t introduced exercise yet as wanted to change my eating habits first from being  a human hoover . By adding those workouts , will that make a bigger difference. I deffo don’t have  a confidence issue on going to the gym, but have a super fear of looking like a prat and falling flat on my face
11/04/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: because chinese 🤩👌🏻
11/04/2025, 4:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup
11/04/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay great yay
11/04/2025, 4:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 0.5lb loss in 5 days is amazing.
11/04/2025, 4:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is why most people fail, they are impatient and fail to see progress. 

0.5 in a week is 2 kgs in a month and 12kgs in 6 months. 

Losing 12kgs completely changes you.
11/04/2025, 5:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: btw, im on a slight calorie surplus because i wanna gain muscle and lost fat at the same time, so i wanted to ask do the same numbers happen in building muscle?
11/04/2025, 5:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: like I will gain 0.5kg in a week?
11/04/2025, 5:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: or what
11/04/2025, 5:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Less, more like 0.2-0.3 per week at best
11/04/2025, 5:07 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: oooh okay thank you
11/04/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks Sameet. I think I’m asking too much and set high mental goals. I seriously have come into this with a mindset of changing for the better and having a better relationship with food and health. 
You guys really do put a person back to reality 💥
12/04/2025, 12:37 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: Hey Coaches 🙋🏻‍♀️
How long does it take to build muscle 💪🏼? Like months or years? I am sure not weeeks 🥹 i know it requires a loooot of patience and hardwork but still wondering 🤔
12/04/2025, 1:39 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. 

1kg muscle can be built in some months probably. 

More takes more time. It’s a continuous process.
12/04/2025, 1:40 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>
12/04/2025, 1:49 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: lol
12/04/2025, 1:49 am - POC - Narmeen Ahmed: 🫠
12/04/2025, 9:35 am - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Hello, is this? Doing Same exercise with machine in same way body adoupt and doesn't make any progress further, gym trainer said we have to hit the muscle in different ways not with the machine because body doesn't make any improvement ( body adoupt)? Is it make sense or??
12/04/2025, 11:12 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): No it doesnt work like that 
if you are progressing on the same exercise, getting stronger, improving form and execution then you will build muscle for sure

12/04/2025, 11:26 am - PF - Sakina Zainab: i was diagnosed with pcos too. a few doctors made my mum cry they were that harsh (i was 18 back then and too overweight) k iski shaadi kese hogi lol. and they suggested glucophage to lower the weight. 
then i found a nice one who explained how pcos works and told me to skip all process food and junk for a year, exercise regularly. i did that and all my symptoms went away literally. I've had no problems ever since.
i didnt know about calories deficit back then and just focused on eating better and working out. im overweight rn too and i do sometimes eat fast food sometimes. but i still dont have any symptoms. <This message was edited>
12/04/2025, 11:30 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: This message was deleted
12/04/2025, 11:42 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: Dude PCOS is not an illness but a condition. Its tough sometimes - granted, but can be maintained with the right help . I was diagnosed at 18 too. The mental effects of seeing your body is the most challenging part. I struggled to have children, but Alhumdulilah have 2 now. There is always light at the end of the tunnel and the knowledge NOW is incredible ❤️
12/04/2025, 2:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: As Sabrina said, it's a condition not an illness. Just understand yourself and be easy.

I can totally understand what Dr. had said to your Mom and what she had gone through. Even you. Just forget the shit of those Dr. Who Said this to you. 
PCOS ladies can have kids.  We reduce weight slowly with PCOS because of lots of it's factores. But don't worry. Just understand yourself, embrace your condition, be sustainable and love yourself. ❤️
12/04/2025, 3:55 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Ok so I have pcos since 2008 but in 2017 I'm able to know how to loose weight with pcos and  recovered means get my periods back on track 28 to 30 days cycle.... Now again I gained weight due to emotional stress etc... My question is at that time I loses weight happily or freely I'm determined, best part is mujy yad b nhi 57kgs sy 49 kgs kasy achive ho gaya tha in 2020.... Now I'm trying but loose hope demotivated unable to loose.... Don't know why.... Question is gym trainer said u loose weight once easily now your body is resistant and already knows you strategi... Now body take longer time to lose weight or fat cells r bigger and it's hard this time to loose weight.... Is it the same???
12/04/2025, 3:59 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: In between 2021 to 2023 I just eat once a day or my first day of the meal is at 2pm and I end my day just having few calories which are a cup of cooled coffee with no sugar and less milk and a bite of pastry.... Now a day my body doesn't work against any diet if I eat some ghar ja or bahir ka my body weight is constant state which is in between 54 to 55 kgs plz guide me @60193244266 @923441183411 what is wrong and right??
12/04/2025, 4:06 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: Guys, there's PCOS and then there's PCOD
PCOS, is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, now syndrome is made up of several diseases/disorders, and is aptly named, as PCOS main, there's a number of different metabolic and/or endocrine problems (insulin resistance, adrenal fatigue, hypothyroidism etc)
PCOD, on the other hand, is Polycystic Ovarian Disease, and is exclusively associated with the ovaries and results in problems with ovulation and menstrual cycle
12/04/2025, 4:06 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: @60193244266 and @923343773307 can correct me if I am wrong
12/04/2025, 4:07 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Your body knows 1 way to lose weight & fat thats is eating less than what your body requires 
Your body's requirement is your maintainance calories which means that if you will eat that particular number of calories then you wont lose or gain weight 
Now to lose weight you need to eat lesser than your maintainance to put your body into a negative energy balance means your body requires more energy but your eating less so to meet its required energy body will burn its stored fat n thats how u lose fat and weight 

Doesnt matter what anyone says, your body will always respond to calorie deficit 

Exercise, activity levels, good protein intake, muscle mass improves the efficiency of this whole processs
12/04/2025, 4:08 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: Aur jahan tak baat hai weight loss ya gain ki, toh as @60193244266 has mentioned at countless points:
Agar aap caloric deficit main hon ge tab hi weight loss ho ga
12/04/2025, 4:10 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Then what how can I differentiate either Im with pcos or pcos??
12/04/2025, 4:11 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: PCOD*
12/04/2025, 4:12 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: Aap ko PCOS ke saath aur hormonal problem bhi hon gi, e.g thyroid issues, insulin resistance,  ya even Type 2 DM
12/04/2025, 4:12 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: DM: Diabetes Mellitus
12/04/2025, 4:15 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: I performed all hormones test and ultrasound, all hormones r normal, just having cyst in ovaries
12/04/2025, 4:15 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: ??
12/04/2025, 4:29 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Same happened with me too when I visited  doc for the first time 🥲
12/04/2025, 4:31 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Whenever I ear fast food ya bahar ka kuch bhi I suddenly feel bloated sluggishwhat do I do
12/04/2025, 4:39 pm - PF - Saroosh Khan: Yeah, so you probably have PCOD
12/04/2025, 5:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: At the end of the day, what you need to do remains the same. 

Work on your habits. 

1. Eat better, more high quality nutrition 
2. ⁠focus on getting close to 100g protein 
3. ⁠make sure you’re in a SUSTAINED calorie deficit
4. ⁠increase activity levels CONSISTENTLY 
5. ⁠Do some form of exercise 
6. supplement with fish oil
7. ⁠maybe also take inositol 
6. ⁠most of all, be patient
12/04/2025, 5:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And the fun part of all this is that this advice stays constant regardless of PCOD, PCOS or not. 

Yes, these conditions make things more complicated and difficult because of things like energy levels, exhaustion, hormones, bloating, inflammation and more. 

But the good thing is that all of these habits ARE IN YOUR CONTROL.
12/04/2025, 5:43 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: @923343773307 has Mash’Allah gone through and beaten the shit out of cancer TWICE now. 

That’s a condition where things aren’t in your control but even then your lifestyle and habits play a HUGE role in recovery. 

He will attest to this more so than I ever can. 

All this to say, you’ve got this. You just need to be consistent and patient. 

And I’ll end this with my favourite quote of all time. 

‘PLAY THE LONG GAME’
12/04/2025, 5:52 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Pure admiration for @923343773307. That takes so much strength ❤️

Every debit must equal a credit in the business world, same rules can apply to PCOS or any condition you have. Take control and smash it 🥊.

12/04/2025, 6:27 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: A supplement for PCOS patient.
12/04/2025, 6:29 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Inositol helps with improving insulin sensitivity
12/04/2025, 6:30 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: To maintain blood sugar levels ?

12/04/2025, 6:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes PCOS ma body ma insulin resistance develop hui hoti hai so myo-inositol helps with better insulin signaling in the body which improves insulin sensitivity <This message was edited>
12/04/2025, 6:32 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yes I also take twice a day
12/04/2025, 6:33 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
I take this daily. 

And I'm taking it from long with gaps. But now I'm quite regular in it.
12/04/2025, 6:35 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: <Media omitted>
Which open is good I'm taking femova
12/04/2025, 6:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
40:1 ratio as suggested.
12/04/2025, 7:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah this is fine.
12/04/2025, 7:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally, best is to have 2g twice daily.
12/04/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Means ye ( Inositol )only for PCOS patient k liye hai ya sub ko lena hai
12/04/2025, 7:26 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I take once a day but consistently. <This message was edited>
12/04/2025, 8:06 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: They don’t prescribe this in the UK, but will mention it next time i have a consultation with my GyNi. My situation is slightly different now as i had a hysterectomy at the end of last year, but retained my ovaries to prevent me from going into early menopause- hell was i wrong. Not allowed HRT either but am taking primrose oil as an extra supplement, which is recommended for PCOS too.

12/04/2025, 8:17 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: From where I can find this in Lahore??
12/04/2025, 8:19 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: This one ?
12/04/2025, 8:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Most doctors are unaware of these things.
12/04/2025, 8:20 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: 40:1 ratio means??
12/04/2025, 8:21 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: @60193244266 plz ye apne PCOS patient k liye suggest Kiya hai??

12/04/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Okay thank you
12/04/2025, 8:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It means 40:1 ratio of Myo-inositol and D-Chiro inositol.
12/04/2025, 8:28 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: I'm taking this once a day plz let me know which is best as you said 2g twice a day, so which is best for me ???
12/04/2025, 8:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think this has 2g too. You can check at the back.
12/04/2025, 8:52 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Is the body fat caliper accurate for measuring body fat %?
12/04/2025, 9:02 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: <Media omitted>
12/04/2025, 9:03 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): boht zada accurate nhi but it can give you a nice idea of your body fat percentage
12/04/2025, 9:03 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: ??
12/04/2025, 9:04 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): what do you want to know about it
12/04/2025, 9:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s slightly less than recommend dosages.
12/04/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Suggest me the good one that can available in lahore
12/04/2025, 9:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>
12/04/2025, 9:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not sure what’s available there. 

I don’t live in Pakistan. 

If you check the market and share what’s available then we can guide you. 

Or just get one that shows more than 2g of inositol
12/04/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I also wanted to ask about some hormonal medications, can I ask?
12/04/2025, 9:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For medications, you’ll need to consult a doctor. 

Medications are outside our scope.
12/04/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Oh okay, but do these medications have any kind of impact of weight loss/ gain?
12/04/2025, 9:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not directly. But something they can effect appetite and all
12/04/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay
12/04/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I hate taking medicines 🫠
12/04/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: like im fine with supplements since ik they’re just supplementing my diet
12/04/2025, 9:19 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but when it comes to medicines, I just wanna work on everything naturally
12/04/2025, 9:22 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay so can you tell me one thing? 

Before Ramadan I got some hormonal tests done and CBC Vit D and Glucose fasting 
some of my hormones were quite deranged so my question was I always try my best to eat healthy and have an overall healthy lifestyle and not always have such abnormal hormonal level but anyway…

if my hormones were deranged and NOW I have properly started focusing on diet and lifestyle 
Is there a possibility, I might not need meds and have good hormonal profile? 😓
12/04/2025, 9:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes 100% 
you will gradually improve with all this
12/04/2025, 9:24 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay inshaAllah hopefully!!!!

The one I used to use and trust was Bean&Peanut and Num’s Cakery.
13/04/2025, 4:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nums is delicious and worth it but I think she’s traveling abhi.

15/04/2025, 2:07 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: when you end up with diarrhea
what happens with the protein and cals? like just trying to understand the chemistry that does protein get properly absorbed or not?
15/04/2025, 2:08 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I usually  face this issue
15/04/2025, 2:08 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Diarrhea and bloating
15/04/2025, 2:08 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Don't know what to do
Should I add chia seeds or green tea
15/04/2025, 2:10 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Despite doing  all the same thing everyday fibre intake protein  and all the same thing every other day
15/04/2025, 2:16 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: my question is also for the coaches
15/04/2025, 2:16 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohh
15/04/2025, 2:17 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: and i don’t face any bloating

15/04/2025, 2:31 am - PF - Dr Sumaira Iqbal: How to get personalised diet plan to lose weight
15/04/2025, 3:08 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: For bloating and gut health, first step is focusing on the basics

1. Making sure you’re having 20-30g of fiber per day 
2. ⁠Drinking at least 2 liters of water 
3. ⁠getting in some daily movement
15/04/2025, 3:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It likely still gets absorbed and if there’s a difference, you don’t need to worry about it. 

No need to unnecessarily complicate things.
15/04/2025, 3:09 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Does chia seeds help in bloating and inflammation?
15/04/2025, 3:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Please go through the post post @923343773307 has tagged you in on Facebook
15/04/2025, 3:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s fiber so they can help but it won’t be a quick fix.
15/04/2025, 3:10 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Yes no quick fix but can help if I take consistently? <This message was edited>
15/04/2025, 3:15 am - Taha Ahmed: If it’s because of low fiber, then yeah, just making sure you’re getting enough fiber every day should help over time
15/04/2025, 3:18 am - Taha Ahmed: We don't do diet plans here- instead, we teach you the basics so you can build your own plan, every single day. You’ll learn how to eat the foods you love while still staying within your calorie range
15/04/2025, 3:20 am - Taha Ahmed: Your body may not fully absorb nutrients, whether its protein, carbs, fats, or micronutrients, because food moves too quickly through the intestines. So yes, some of the protein and calories can be lost due to reduced digestion and absorption

Positives are - i know more about macro’s, ignore auntie “tootkays”, hunger pangs at bay. Most of all content.
Yes a little plateaux, but know overall i’m on the right track 💕🙏

16/04/2025, 12:41 am - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: All excerises that I did were for 30 mins

16/04/2025, 6:46 am - PF - Aqsa Arif Zunaib: Okay, thanks
16/04/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Hello, question for coaches. May have been asked before but since this group is always running much faster than me i probabely missed it.
16/04/2025, 10:47 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Why is everyone talking about inflammation these days? Theres an anti inflammatory diet, weight loss not happening because of inflammation etcetc
16/04/2025, 10:49 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Like today someone at my gym was doing an assisted pull up which i have been really wanting to do. I was told you cant do those unless you are at maintanence or bulking (currently in deficit) I joked that i have plenty of reserves and i was told then u probabely have alot of inflammation around your joints…. But i feel totally good, no aches no pains no issues other than weight struggles which are due to my lack of consistency.. <This message was edited>
16/04/2025, 10:50 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: The lady doing the pull up was as tiny as they come. I know i’m much stronger
16/04/2025, 10:53 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): First of all this anti-inflammatory diet is just a new FAD diet in the market & some non-sense people are cashing in on it. Don't even bother giving it a thought

Secondly you dont have to be bulking or at maintainance to do assisted pullups or any exercise for that matter. As long as you have got the strength and energy to do it and you know how to do it with proper form and execution, then just do it
16/04/2025, 10:56 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But inflammation is due to stress right. Weight training adds stress. But its not like 24/7 stress kay forever your body is inflamed. Or then some diseases can add… i hear so many people talking that they have alot of inflammation, its like the new buzz word
16/04/2025, 11:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): There are multiple things which can cause inflammation, its your body's natural response to an injury or an infection or some external stimuli etc. 

if you are resting and recovering properly post workout, good sleep, your nutrition is good protein intake is adequate then training wala stress is absolutely normal n nothing to be concerned about at all <This message was edited>
16/04/2025, 12:30 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Majority of them do not have proper understanding of inflammation and then there are those who need content so they can con you 😁
16/04/2025, 12:31 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Inflammation, insulin, adrenal fatigue, leaky gut etc.
16/04/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
16/04/2025, 12:49 pm - Taha Ahmed: Inflammation hoti kya hai, logon ko yehi samajh nahi hai abhi. 

So most are cashing in on this misconception/new fad like others said above. 

Don't fall into this trap. Keep it simple. Nothing to be worried about!
16/04/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Any recommendations on a decent pair of trainers suitable for walking and the gym? Gravitating towards the On clouds but there bloody expensive 😬
16/04/2025, 2:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): OnCloud is amazing 
You can check Under Armour
16/04/2025, 2:32 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thanks for that, will check the Under Armour out too. Gotta say the OnClouds were super comfortable and absolutely beat all the pretty Nikes and Addidas that i tried. May just stomach the extortionate price tag 🙈
16/04/2025, 2:33 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: On Cloud
Hoka
Asics 
All great for running and walking

Hoka and Asics are great for weight training though

16/04/2025, 2:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The best shoes for the gym are ideally flat foot shoes.

16/04/2025, 2:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not great for running though
16/04/2025, 3:12 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Can Nike Dunks be included with it. If thats the case my black and white Panda’s are ready to go
16/04/2025, 3:20 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I need to get myself a pair of flat ones.
16/04/2025, 3:20 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes dunks are flat too
16/04/2025, 3:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. They can.

17/04/2025, 10:33 am - PF - Sabrina Malik: If theres ones thing i’ve learned from this group is embrace a Loss and celebrate it- Well done 🫡. Granted at times the effort doesn’t always correlate with attainment, But your case it did. Not only have you successfully taken control on what and why your eating, but lost 1/2 a lb with it. Super well done 🥊💕
17/04/2025, 12:08 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Share these to fb and I can do a rundown
17/04/2025, 12:09 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Also the graph shows 0.5kg ka loss
17/04/2025, 12:17 pm - PF - Yasin Kodvavi: That, imo, is within fluctuation range. 
Early meal + less water before bed or in the middle of the night can cause that much deviation.
17/04/2025, 12:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Or it could be weight loss. 

Deviations are temporary. The graph shows consistently lower.

18/04/2025, 9:05 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes if you are in a defict, training too & not having enough Protein means your body wont be able to hold onto the muscles well and will see some muscle loss
18/04/2025, 9:05 am - PF - Noor E Fatima: No i am not doing any exercise

18/04/2025, 3:28 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Are pickles good for a low calorie snack (vinegar based not oil). Are there any health benefits too 🤔
18/04/2025, 3:34 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): pickle without oil will be like almost zero calories as vinegar doesnt have calories n you dont have to log for vegetables
18/04/2025, 3:44 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: May be a dumb dumb question, Is that all vegetables or are there exception to some like potatoes, sweetcorn etc (on the provision the way they are cooked)
18/04/2025, 3:48 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): ofcourse you will log for potato or corn etc but not the vegetables like gajar mooli piyaz etc.
18/04/2025, 3:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you dont have to log for green vegetables like leafy greens, zucchini, cucumber, spinach, lettuce, celery 
Tomato, onions waghera ko bhi log krny ki zarurat nhi unless u r having boht zada quantity ma

Hello, @60193244266 I found this locally plz guide me
Should i buy this or some else???
18/04/2025, 5:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: This is for PCOS specific, right? 
It has melatonin. But for why? <This message was edited>
18/04/2025, 5:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Decent myo-inositol but it has melatonin which is a sleep aid.
18/04/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: I suppose sleep cures a lot of unknown problems. I know that diazepam is given for many conditions, but is predominantly an anti-depressant 🤷 <This message was edited>
18/04/2025, 6:25 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Sleep issues = high cortisol
18/04/2025, 6:25 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: But it doesn't have D-chiro inositol. Is it fine to have only Myo-inositol in PCOS?
18/04/2025, 6:26 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Let me search some else then
18/04/2025, 6:35 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: <Media omitted>
pastry chef = no added effort needed for daily steps 😂
18/04/2025, 6:36 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Thats amazing- better then full body workout🥰
18/04/2025, 7:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: should a person take magnesium bisglycinate? I’ve heard it’s really good for sleep and nerves? Should elderly people take it? 

Or it it like only people who need it and is prescribed by a doctor?
18/04/2025, 7:45 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Not everyone needs it though it can help
18/04/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: if a doctor prescribes it then should we take it, or we can take it?
18/04/2025, 7:46 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: like my mother has carpel tunnel syndrome so if she takes it, is it fine?
18/04/2025, 8:22 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah.
18/04/2025, 8:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you

19/04/2025, 1:19 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Now a day I'm also just focusing on Protein and fiber. Deficit Thora sa oper nechay ho raha bs. Because Ramdan Mai proteine properly hit nhe ho pae. 

Plus I slipped from stairs (office) yesterday. As a result, I sustained minor injuries to my lower back, abdomen, and pubic symphysis area.

Can't walk properly. On almost complete rest. I had started proper walk and excersies but now I think it will take few days to recover. Then I can again start proper walk and workouts slowly cause I'm advised not to put complete weight on the back. 
So now focus is on calcium, and protein, finer too. <This message was edited>
19/04/2025, 1:51 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Salamaat. I hope you get well soon and feel better soon too.

Please focus on resting up and you can get back to your usual routine once you are better
19/04/2025, 1:52 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: I think even if you stay on maintainence calories should be fine
19/04/2025, 1:58 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Was going to recommend that. Aim for maintenance and recovery. It can help speed recovery and then once you’re better, you can aim for deficit. 

Protein can play a role too
19/04/2025, 2:14 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How many calories in 1 chocolate sprinkle donut?
19/04/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Get well soon  💐
19/04/2025, 3:04 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Search Dunkin or Krispy Kreme. I’m guessing 250-300
19/04/2025, 6:22 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>

19/04/2025, 12:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Inositol is the necessary one for PCOS
19/04/2025, 12:16 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: why is it necessary?
19/04/2025, 12:17 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i was recommended long time ago, that too from a dermatologist uss waqt I took it then stopped
19/04/2025, 12:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Walikum os salam.
Yes. Thanks.
19/04/2025, 12:59 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Yes, protine is my focus.
19/04/2025, 1:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): PCOS ma body ma insulin resistance develop hui hoti hai so myo-inositol helps with better insulin signaling in the body which improves insulin sensitivity
19/04/2025, 1:01 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Inositol  is a supplement  right?
19/04/2025, 1:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yes
19/04/2025, 4:02 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Has anyone got any

19/04/2025, 4:32 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: If the issue is persisting, it might be a good idea to see a doctor/gastroenterologist
19/04/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Ok if I'm having inositol sachet what the other specific component should be included with this
19/04/2025, 4:39 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Oura looks good, but also seen quite a few on Amazon.
19/04/2025, 4:41 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: Whats the fibre target to hit? @60193244266 @923343773307

19/04/2025, 4:56 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Hard to eat this much fibre :D
19/04/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: One of the things I like to do is get the small bite size goodies and spread out intake from sweet stuff over the course of the day
19/04/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: While keeping calories in check
19/04/2025, 4:57 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: You can try that

next time just use more water & blend it better 
 use milk instead of water maybe or just have half a scoop to start with so that ur taste buds adopt with the taste

21/04/2025, 9:29 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Aoa,shall we use cac 1000 as a calcium suppliment in routine?
21/04/2025, 9:30 am - Taha Ahmed: Ws. If you're not consuming any foods that have calcium in it then you may take CaC regularly.
It's also got a VitC in it which is good.
21/04/2025, 9:41 am - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.We also need to add in calories for a cac tablet then?
21/04/2025, 4:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No
21/04/2025, 4:39 pm - PF - Sana Hashmi: Ok.thank you
21/04/2025, 6:00 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: A little deflated- lost sweet FA this week. On the contrary i have gained 1lb. Had 1 bad day, but redeemed the deficit the next. What am i doing wrong?
21/04/2025, 6:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Looking at the daily fluctuations rather than looking at long term trends.
21/04/2025, 6:05 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Aint budged an ounce this week. Granted i indulged for 1 day, but kept to a deficit on all the others. What is a plateau usually caused by? Should i increase my activity or change my macros. Pissed of with myself is an understatement
21/04/2025, 6:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Do nothing. It could very well just be water retention from the menstrual cycle.
21/04/2025, 6:06 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: When I say trends, you neeed to look at data over 3-4 weeks and then make adjustments.
21/04/2025, 6:08 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: I wish i could put it down to that, but unfortunately in my case i had a hysterectomy. Not eligible for HRT either.
21/04/2025, 6:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Even then. How’s sleep or stress?
21/04/2025, 6:53 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: I work in the finance sector and have 2 little rugrats who have been home the last 2 weeks! I think that answers your question about sleep and stress 🤣. Work Stress has deffo increased this week. <This message was edited>
21/04/2025, 8:59 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I wanted to ask something about electrolytes, a lot of times we hear people saying you’re hydrated enough because you’re having good amount of water but you should take ORS or something for your electrolyte balance

How can we know our electrolytes are well balanced? 
And how can we ensure it
21/04/2025, 9:23 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, etc.) help regulate hydration, nerve function, and muscle contractions.

They're great for:

✓ Athletes sweating heavily in long workouts

✔ Runners, cyclists, or those training in heat

✔ People on low-carb/keto diets (who lose more

sodium through urine)

✔️Certain medical conditions

But if you're not sweating much, drinking enough water, and eating a balanced diet, you're likely getting all the electrolytes you need from food.

21/04/2025, 9:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Is bloating normal  after a high protein meal?
21/04/2025, 10:11 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: So sick and tired of this issue facing every single day
Patience running out😫
21/04/2025, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends. Some bloating is normal with food intake even with or without protein. 

Some people get more bloating after eating certain foods like dairy and may indicate issues like lactose intolerance
21/04/2025, 10:48 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok running out of patience  now
21/04/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: can you give a little insight on this coaches?
21/04/2025, 11:49 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you
22/04/2025, 12:44 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Just use salt in your cooking and you should be fine. 
Only athletes need to directly worry about salt intake and sodium levels <This message was edited>

Unfortunately locally koi acha fish oil nahin hai.
22/04/2025, 10:12 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Is this available in Pak?

22/04/2025, 10:15 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Nature’s bounty isn’t a good brand for it?
22/04/2025, 10:15 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Check my vitamin store, they might have blackmore but i think not anymore. They used to

@923441183411
25/04/2025, 12:06 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): kneeling pushups or wall pushups as a progression If normal pushups are tough for you 
once you start progressing with kneeling or wall pushups then gradually you can shift to conventional pushups
25/04/2025, 12:06 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Alright 👍
25/04/2025, 12:07 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: I am doing wall push-up since 2 years but yeh kuch alag hi hai 😂
25/04/2025, 11:45 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: it’s so true I couldn’t do one when I starting exercising now I can do 20 in a row
25/04/2025, 12:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>
ending another week with a quick treadmill session & 30 pushups wohoo
25/04/2025, 12:33 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I progressed from wall pushups when they no longer felt challenging to incline pushups
25/04/2025, 12:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: https://youtu.be/yAbg3_pJKvw?si=rAly97Xoegyg3uIl
25/04/2025, 12:35 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Just increase the height of the box platform until you find the right height that's challenging and doable. Later on you can decrease the height as you keep building strength
25/04/2025, 4:20 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Okay will try this
25/04/2025, 4:20 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Thank you

Hey coaches 🥹 today i check my weight and from 85 to 80 just because of you i cant tell how much i feel happy.My stubborn fat and i cant believe i reduces 5 kg just because of you 😌
25/04/2025, 5:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s bloody brilliant.
25/04/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: btw coaches, how often should we measure body girth measurements?
25/04/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: especially when trying to build muscle
25/04/2025, 5:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 2-4 weeks.
25/04/2025, 5:21 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For muscle, 4 weeks at least.
25/04/2025, 5:21 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you
25/04/2025, 5:36 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Is it true that drinking  water right after watermill cause diarrhea?
25/04/2025, 5:36 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: No
25/04/2025, 5:37 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
25/04/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I have a question (once again time to eat up your brain @coaches)

the thing is I see people saying that if you go to the gym and focus on strength training your muscles will grow but your stamina will suck so until unless you run on treadmill or do anything that elevates your heart rate, you won’t be fit or strong in the long run

Can you please explain the science behind it?
And also for PCOS patients ive also heard that you should lessen the cardio in your life because that causes stress which kinda messes with your hormones 

Whereas, from my personal experience I have seen whenever I ran even if it was for 20 mins, after that my performance in any kind of exercises is twice times better as it normally is

So please enlighten me
25/04/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Who are these people? Lifting weights will increase stamina. 

But stamina is specific. If you want to build stamina for a marathon then you need to train for that. 

Lifting weights won’t get you there. But it absolutely improves stamina in general.
25/04/2025, 9:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Plus if something is working for you then that’s all you need to care about. Regardless of what anyone says. Including me.
25/04/2025, 9:26 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Hahah there are people with the same old mindset that treadmill workout is the best for everything but I completely get what you mean
25/04/2025, 9:27 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: These kind of people say that body building is just transforming your body and looking a certain way and looking aesthetically pleasing

25/04/2025, 9:28 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: @60193244266 pilates twice a week is enough to feel a difference?
25/04/2025, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If these are people that are in their 40s then just do this and move on 👆
25/04/2025, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Feel a difference in what?
25/04/2025, 9:28 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
25/04/2025, 9:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: How weak you are? Yes 🤣🫣
25/04/2025, 9:31 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: core strength, hip flexors etc. i have anterior pelvic tilt so thinking of taking two sessions per week for that and yes i do work on the tilt at home also @60193244266
25/04/2025, 9:32 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Btw, is genetics involve in the quantity of abs? As in I’ve heard genetics plays a key role in having 4,6,8 pack abs?
25/04/2025, 9:32 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: i also have abs, theyre just hidden under the fat. 😂
25/04/2025, 9:33 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahahahh I know the part that we all have abs (abdominal muscles) but yes they’re just hidden under the fat haha
25/04/2025, 9:33 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: khatay peetay ghar ke abs hain.
25/04/2025, 9:34 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: hehe
25/04/2025, 9:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. It’s a form of strength training so will help.
25/04/2025, 9:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yes. 8 packs wali kismat nahin mili 🤣🤣
25/04/2025, 9:35 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hahahahahaha
25/04/2025, 9:36 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: in my case, i have visible obliques and just upper abs 🤭
25/04/2025, 9:37 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: mehnat abhi chal rahi hai 🫡
25/04/2025, 9:43 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I also wanted to know one more thing, though it might sound stupid but anyways,

What is the measurement of strength? I mean most people look so strong and they say “arm wrestle with me”and they end up losing even though the opponent looked weak honestly, so like is strength related to genes? And you can build it too? But there are lucky people in the world who are born powerful?
25/04/2025, 9:49 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Arm wrestle is not a measure or strength, its a sport & those who do arm wrestling follow a routine which compliments their sport, it requires a certain technique not everyone is trained for that
If you are lifts are improving in the gym you are progressively overloading then you are getting stronger
25/04/2025, 9:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Thank you coach ali, makes sense
25/04/2025, 9:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ask an arm wrestler to compete with a powerlifter in a deadlift and uski potty nikal jaani hai 🤣
25/04/2025, 10:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: But honestly I am not talking about proper professional arm wrestler vs power lifter 

I was taking for general people, one who strength trains vs one who doesn’t
25/04/2025, 10:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I often hear people just randomly arm wrestling and winning even though their life doesn’t involve any kind of exercise
25/04/2025, 10:00 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): like that was an example so that you can understand the context
25/04/2025, 10:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Training adaptations follow something called the rule of specificity. 

You improve or build strength in what you do. 

For instance if you want a stronger squat, you need to start squatting.
25/04/2025, 10:01 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Oh okay
25/04/2025, 10:01 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): that is dependent upon many factors
25/04/2025, 10:01 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Genetics play a massive role in this as well.
25/04/2025, 10:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: For example, Africans are always better at endurance sports.

26/04/2025, 4:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you
26/04/2025, 5:38 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: if i want to build strength and do pull ups, should I do pull up drills everyday (i do gym 4 times a week) or should i train for it on just upper body days?
26/04/2025, 5:56 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): doing it everyday wont help as muscles need rest n recovery to grow n get stronger 
do pullups first on your upper body days start doing banded or assisted pullups or negative pullups and then gradually progress to a regular pullup also work on your core and arms strength
26/04/2025, 6:11 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you 🙏

27/04/2025, 1:02 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 After Eid, I'm struggling to get back on track with my routine. I'm experiencing intense cravings and feeling hungry most of the time, which often leads to overeating and after that there is like a feeling that I've already achieved significant weight loss, so gaining 1-2 kg wouldn't do much damage. I'd like to overcome this mindset and stay focused on my goals. I am also not hitting my protein goals falling way short most of the times since last 3-4 weeks.
27/04/2025, 1:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Maybe move to maintenance calories for a 6-8 week period.
27/04/2025, 1:27 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I am already on maintenance since last week of Ramadan back then you suggest me to have 2100 calories and see that the weight moves or not but after Eid I’ve not stick to it and overeat most of the times sometimes I didn’t even count my calories and o think on those days i would’ve easily eaten double of my calories
27/04/2025, 1:31 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I am currently on 65kgs now I want to maintain this weight and focus on muscle building.But protein intake is really been an issue for me now adays I am finding it very difficult to complete my protein intake
27/04/2025, 2:09 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: How come? Why are you finding it difficult to?

Have your priorities changed? Have your goals changed?
27/04/2025, 2:09 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Most of the times I am eating out with friends
27/04/2025, 2:14 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah so that’s always going to be a struggle. 

But you can still choose things that align with your goals.
27/04/2025, 2:16 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Now way my priorities and Goal are still the same. But I think for the past 6 months I was very consistent with my diet and excercise so now as I am a bit inconsistent nowadays that’s why I feel a little uncomfortable.
I just want to be consistent with eating nutritious food most of the time.
27/04/2025, 2:17 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: I will try my best from tomorrow inshallah
27/04/2025, 2:51 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Start the day with a solid breakfast. 

Also, are your workouts ongoing?
27/04/2025, 1:28 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yeah I have completed all my 5 workouts this week last week was 3
27/04/2025, 1:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Chalo at least you’re building consistency there.
27/04/2025, 2:54 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: <Media omitted>
My protein whey is currently out of stock in both alpha nutrition and swole Spartan. They advise me to buy either this one or Bpi.
Are they good brands?
27/04/2025, 2:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Haan decent hain n
27/04/2025, 3:00 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Ok
27/04/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Are there any standard measurement ratio? For example like calves and biceps should be the same? 
Or there are no one size fit all, it’s all about individuality?
27/04/2025, 6:05 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): na na 
you can always grow a muscle bigger than the other so you cant standarize these things at all. Varies from person to person
27/04/2025, 6:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: oh okay thank you
27/04/2025, 9:15 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): I am working on losing weight and would really like to focus on my belly fat too. Are there any home exercises or other tips you could suggest for this?
At the moment, I am mainly watching my calorie intake, and apart from a 30 min to 1 hour walk, I don’t have any other exercises in my routine.
@60193244266 
@923343773307
27/04/2025, 9:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exercises don’t target fat. They target muscle so they can help you build muscle. 

Something you should be doing for your full body. We have workout programs in the community that you can follow for that
27/04/2025, 9:38 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): Thank you for clarifying that
I am not following those programs right now because my schedule is really hectic. I have already talked to Coach Talha, and we decided I’d keep track of my calorie intake and add some walking or stretching to my routine.
But I feel like I should start working on my belly too.
27/04/2025, 9:39 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): Also , could you please recommend any late night low calories snacks
27/04/2025, 9:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Calories and walking is going to focus on your belly too.
27/04/2025, 9:42 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I just use diet soda but I’m sure someone has other options. 

You could also just save calories from the day so you can eat later.
27/04/2025, 9:43 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): Oh that’s a relief
27/04/2025, 9:47 pm - PF - Asma Said Khan (Dinara Khan): Was worried that eating late might be the bad idea but now the problem is solved 
Thanks! 🙂

28/04/2025, 12:55 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: Hi coaches,
Can you please guide me? I know that starting a workout routine can cause some pain or cramps afterward, but how can we tell if the level of pain we’re feeling is normal? I just started a 3-day home workout program, and after completing the second day, I woke up with pain and cramps in my legs. Is it mornal? For the third day, should I wait until the pain reduces before continuing, or can I proceed after taking a day or two off?
28/04/2025, 12:56 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: I’m new in doing workouts before that I usually walk.
28/04/2025, 1:10 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can carry on after 1-2 days of rest. 

The pain will start to go away (and not come back) once you’re done with week 2
28/04/2025, 1:11 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s just your muscle aren’t used to work and load so they’re sore initially.
28/04/2025, 1:15 pm - PF - Kashaf Ad Dooja: Ok thank you.
28/04/2025, 3:47 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: @60193244266 can diabetic people

28/04/2025, 5:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not sure. You’ll need to ask the brand.
28/04/2025, 5:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Sulfur is naturally there in most protein sources including dairy.
28/04/2025, 5:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Even chicken and lentils have sulfur. <This message was edited>

28/04/2025, 5:59 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: It could be something else then?

29/04/2025, 4:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Diet soda and sparkling water is practically the same thing. 

Both can damage your tooth enamel. 

But one of them tastes nice. The other tastes like shit 🤣
29/04/2025, 4:29 pm - PF - Fatima Hamza: Tooth can be replaced but not the internal organs, 😭
29/04/2025, 4:33 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Same goes with gatorade right
29/04/2025, 4:34 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: It can damage the tooth enamel
29/04/2025, 4:34 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: which is why should be taken sometimes not every other day
29/04/2025, 4:34 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: No internal organs were harmed in the moderate consumption of either beverage 😁
29/04/2025, 4:43 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): us tarah to hr acidic drink can damage the enamel but moderation is the key
29/04/2025, 4:43 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ok 🫡
29/04/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Diet soda doesn’t have ANY IMPACT on any INTERNAL ORGANS.
29/04/2025, 4:47 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Gatorade isn’t carbonated.
29/04/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s the carbonation that does the damage to tooth enamel.
29/04/2025, 4:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: So no problem at all?
29/04/2025, 4:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really. Unless you overdo the electrolytes.
29/04/2025, 4:49 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: and is there any way i can know the overdose of electrolytes?

29/04/2025, 5:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you have 20g of powder then 5g of each.
29/04/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Ok so, mujy each seeds sy 1 tbsp measure kr k calories note down krni han
29/04/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: 🤔

29/04/2025, 6:01 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Why dry roasted seed calories are higher than the plan seeds?
29/04/2025, 6:02 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Because when you roast seeds, they lose water weight but calories remain the same.
29/04/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: But Google shows higher calories
29/04/2025, 6:03 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: null

Do you guys know the reason of it ??
@60193244266 
@923343773307
30/04/2025, 12:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Don’t think it has anything to with the workouts
30/04/2025, 12:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: See if it’s there tomorrow.
30/04/2025, 12:48 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Okay
30/04/2025, 12:49 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Yeah because mai use to hoon workouts ki bs workouts change Huey hain ab but krti to pehle bhi thi
30/04/2025, 12:54 am - Taha Ahmed: Usually feeling a sense of “heat” or warmth in a specific area like the stomach can be due to a few different reasons. One common cause is increased blood flow and muscle activation in the area during or after a workout (which you did), and esp. if you've done core/abdomen exercises- your muscles generate heat when working. Another reason could be your body is repairing and adapting to training stimulus, OR if you’ve recently changed your diet (esp. spicy foods or caffeine), that can also cause a sensation of heat or acidity in the stomach area. 
STress or anxiety can also trigger a nervous system response that feels like warmth in the belly (but that's usually an internal feeling). And lastly, if you're on any new supplements or medications (like fat burners or thermogenics or even fat loss teas), they can raise core temperature too. 
Unless it's painful, persistent, or comes with other symptoms, it’s usually nothing to worry about. 

If I were you, I would get curious and see what all have I been doing differently (other than working out), that could be causing this, and keep a journal of all those things.
30/04/2025, 1:17 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: I think that is because of workout because as you said it usually felt after workout kyn ke ab theek hai but thori deir pehle Jb workout se free hui thi to ziada feel horha tha

30/04/2025, 1:52 am - PF - Muhammad Ali: Thanks 🙏
30/04/2025, 1:53 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Try it with low fat milk, olpers or anhaar will be easily available even dayfresh bhi in Lahore. 

But olpers have long usage date as compared to other brands. Anhaar is for 3-4 days maximum. <This message was edited>

In water it tastes like dirty dishwater.

Is that ok.
30/04/2025, 4:14 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. You might lose some muscle and strength but that should come back once you start working out again
30/04/2025, 4:14 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Right ✅️
30/04/2025, 4:23 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): absolutely amazing🔥

30/04/2025, 5:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: Can't tell just like that. 
You'll have to use a calorimeter to be able to tell exact heat production and loss by the body 😅
30/04/2025, 6:11 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Amazing! The best thing is actually I’m not following a diet, but learning how to make better decisions and food choices. Working progress on some elements, but learning curves are good to give you that “get up and go” factor 💕

01/05/2025, 2:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 5000iu is like the upper end of the daily dosage you can take it daily if your vitD levels are low 
i would suggest 2000-4000iu for a daily long term usage
01/05/2025, 2:57 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: <Media omitted>
I eat this as a mid day snack. But i feel bad if i consume whole of it idk why. Within my calorie limit. I feel i have eaten too much sweet. Please guide
01/05/2025, 3:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): There is no need to feel bad 
first it fits your daily caloric intake then it has like 20g protein n sugar isnt an issue if majority of the daily calories are coming from nutritionally rich foods
01/05/2025, 3:12 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: <Media omitted>
These are two days example. Please guide me if it is okay to consume this

01/05/2025, 3:15 pm - PF - Noor E Fatima: Thankyou

I check on the same tile floor but on different  tiles lol 2 3 baa then confirmation milti🤣🤣
05/05/2025, 10:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Eating too much salty food, hormonal changes (esp. around your period), standing or sitting for too long, not drinking enough water, or even stress and lack of sleep, and sometimes certain medications cause it too
05/05/2025, 10:24 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okay understood
05/05/2025, 10:24 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: The water weight drops initially ( in start) or throughout the weight loss journey??
05/05/2025, 10:32 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Does bad posture results in buldging tummy (lower abdomen )
05/05/2025, 10:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: ?
05/05/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not necessarily
05/05/2025, 10:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Most of it is in the start but it fluctuates over time
05/05/2025, 10:52 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
05/05/2025, 10:54 pm - PF - Fatima Hamza: @923343773307 
my LDL cholesterol is 137
And HDL cholesterol is 74...
Quite high..
So for protein intake should I consume  eggs and cheese or not??
05/05/2025, 11:14 pm - Taha Ahmed: You can still have eggs and cheese in moderation- for most people, dietary cholesterol doesn’t raise blood cholesterol much. High LDL is more often due to low fiber, lack of activity, excess saturated fat, or genetics.

You can go over this thread on Facebook and read the comments to learn more about High Cholesterol (usually highly LDL or often called as 'bad cholesterol')

06/05/2025, 11:06 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Hey so, my major issue in fitness these days is that even though I have been working out regularly, I don't feel quite strong
06/05/2025, 11:06 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: I keep feeling low and fatigued. And I am not able to push through my limits.
06/05/2025, 11:08 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): How is your sleep, daily protein intake & overall caloric intake ?
06/05/2025, 11:10 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Sleep is 6-7 hours. My daily protein is probably just ok. Not the best. I haven't tracked calories but I don't have a big appetite. I eat small portions
06/05/2025, 11:15 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d recommend tracking calories cause you might be undereating protein or calories and that’s affecting recovery
06/05/2025, 11:17 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Right. Cos it's weird that energy levels are so low.
It wasn't the same when I started working out.  I used to be so energetic and fresh. I wasn't tracking calories back then
06/05/2025, 11:18 am - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: But I can definitely feel the difference
06/05/2025, 12:56 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. How many workouts do you do? When was the last time you took a break?
06/05/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: so I workout 3-4 times a week. and i mostly target two muscles in one session
06/05/2025, 1:29 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: i last took break in last week of Ramadan and started back in 2 weeks
06/05/2025, 1:31 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Does under eating also causes bloating
06/05/2025, 1:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not really.
06/05/2025, 1:44 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then yes, calories or protein are what you should be looking at first. 

Also, are you training to failure daily?
06/05/2025, 1:45 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okwy
06/05/2025, 2:08 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Are falsay healthy
06/05/2025, 2:14 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yeah they are rich in nutrients and anti oxidants 
but please healthy and unhealthy ki debate sy khud ko azaad karain foods ko esy label na karain. As long as your overall diet contains mostly whole foods, enough protein and fiber, fruits and vegies, you are eating as per your goal & body's requirements , you can eat everything
06/05/2025, 2:15 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok ok 👍
06/05/2025, 7:03 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: <Media omitted>
Is it good enough?
06/05/2025, 7:14 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: Today was my day 1 following your 4 day gym workout plan. I really enjoyed it. All the exercises were different and new as compared to what I usually do
06/05/2025, 7:22 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes. But the dosage for myo-inositol is around 2-3g taken twice a day!
06/05/2025, 7:24 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: <Media omitted>
Thought on this supplement
06/05/2025, 7:24 pm - Taha Ahmed: Berberine for what?
06/05/2025, 7:24 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: <Media omitted>
And this too
06/05/2025, 7:25 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: For blood sugar levels
06/05/2025, 7:26 pm - Taha Ahmed: Apparently it works similarly to metformin in improving insulin sensitivity (which is a key issue in PCOS). It may also help lower blood sugar, reduce insulin resistance, and aid in weight management by supporting metabolism. It can provide some benefits but it's not a magic pill though.

I've talked about Berberine here - https://www.facebook.com/groups/projectfomo/posts/630980796310202 <This message was edited>
06/05/2025, 7:28 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Let me check it
06/05/2025, 7:28 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: And wat about other supplement?
06/05/2025, 7:28 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Acetyl L carintine
06/05/2025, 7:29 pm - Taha Ahmed: L-Carnitine helps the body convert fat into energy and may support blood sugar regulation and insulin sensitivity over time (NOTE!! don't confuse fat burning with fat loss here - it's not a fat loss supplement), It can help those with metabolic issues like PCOS or type 2 diabetes. While research is still mixed, doses between 500–2000 mg/day have shown potential benefits, esp in women with PCOS. <This message was edited>
06/05/2025, 7:31 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: I am having problems in my blood sugar levels
06/05/2025, 7:31 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: My blood sugar is flactuating
06/05/2025, 8:22 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: @923343773307 sir is using berberin or metmorphin make you BP low
Because I use metmorphin in  last August to November, now a days my BP is low that I never felt my whole life today my BP is 80/65
06/05/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Although I'm having protein rich meals or trying to have more protein and fiber, after having meal too I feel dizzy and when I check BP is low
06/05/2025, 8:24 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: I have zero energy
06/05/2025, 8:25 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: <Media omitted>
Today I start this too
06/05/2025, 8:26 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: @923343773307 Plz guide about exercise although physician ask to not to walk or exercise
06/05/2025, 8:37 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: i m regular with my creatine intake and i see visible change in my strength during workouts.
06/05/2025, 8:58 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: What is a low calorie binder I can I use in my protein bars? I have chocolate protein powder that I want to use up because drinking it makes me gag, but I don’t want to add peanut butter as a binder (calories). Will water work? Haha <This message was edited>
06/05/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Sabina Saeed requested to join.
06/05/2025, 8:59 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: oo i can try using milk
06/05/2025, 9:04 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: You bought it from Pakistan. Right? 
Does Dr. Recommended you this brand for berberine?
06/05/2025, 9:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: These L-creatine supplement's?
06/05/2025, 9:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’d consult a doctor for this first. And then we can look at other factors.
06/05/2025, 9:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can. Even a smudge of dates or honey might help.
06/05/2025, 9:13 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Why did the physician say no exercise? Or walk?
06/05/2025, 9:16 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: Because of low bp
06/05/2025, 9:17 pm - PF - Nimra Ramzan: He said
06/05/2025, 9:18 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Nope creatine monohydrate
06/05/2025, 9:19 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Dr recommend me to take berbine that it might help in pcos .I bought it but never use it . For insulin resistance
06/05/2025, 9:20 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: They are good for PCOS.
👍
06/05/2025, 9:25 pm - PF - Huma Suleman: Wat is the dosage
06/05/2025, 9:26 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: One tablet or as per the recommendation of Dr. 

I'm also thinking about starting it.

06/05/2025, 11:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: There’s mixed research but you can try it. Theres no downside other than a financial cost.
07/05/2025, 12:46 am - PF - Dr Sumaira Iqbal left
07/05/2025, 6:30 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I have a question coaches🙋🏻‍♀️
I am having severe throat ache and fever since morning today so I couldn’t do any workout, steps or even hitting my protein intake today 
I think it’s some viral infection 
I have been super consistent since last 4 weeks and today was my week 5, day 2 
I am going to the doctor and will get medicines and maybe might not be super consistent with diet and workout for 1-2 days more

Will it effect my progress on a bigger level?😔 <This message was edited>
07/05/2025, 6:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Not at all. Focus on recovery and once you feel better, you can start focusing on these things again.
07/05/2025, 6:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: What Sameet said^
And honestly, rest is part of the process. It helps your body heal and come back stronger. One or even a few days off won’t undo weeks of consistency. So rest, recover, and then come back swinging :)
07/05/2025, 6:35 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Thank you so much coaches!! That’s a big relief! Resting well so that will come back stronger In Sha Allah 💪🏻
07/05/2025, 6:42 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Also one more question (which might sound silly 🤦🏻‍♀️) 

People say when you get sick that you’re not strong/ healthy enough
As in, they go on saying you eat so good then why do you get sick if your immunity is good?
07/05/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I hate when people say I am weak or something like that, if a person gets caught up with viral and he/ she recovers fast that means he/ she is healthy right?
07/05/2025, 6:44 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Plus getting viral infection is common because often at times, we see the weather changing and people getting cough, throat ache or whatever
07/05/2025, 6:44 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: How many sugar is there in coke ki bottle 
Spoon mai batade
07/05/2025, 6:46 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: What is a 400-500ish calorie fast food I can consume at the mall?
07/05/2025, 6:46 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: I usually opt for healthier options but not feeling it atm, cravings
07/05/2025, 6:47 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): 6inch subway can be an option
07/05/2025, 6:47 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: what about channa chaat?
07/05/2025, 6:48 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: It does have papri though and dahi and chutneys
07/05/2025, 6:50 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): depends upon the quantity obviously but 400-500 calories sy zada hosakti hai chana chaat
07/05/2025, 6:54 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: ?
07/05/2025, 6:56 pm - Taha Ahmed: It’s honestly a very stupid thing to say to anyone. I wouldn’t even waste time entertaining people who think like that!!

Because if that were true- if illness only came to those who “don’t take care of themselves”, then I should’ve been immune. I was working out consistently, eating delicious and nourishing food, taking care of my sleep, my mental and emotional health, journaling, meditating… you name it. I was the epitome of 'healthy'.

But I still got cancer. (Twice now!!)

So what happened to my immunity? Did it miss the memo?

Life doesn’t work like that. Illness isn’t a punishment for not doing enough self-care. And wellness doesn’t guarantee immunity from everything life throws your way.

Sometimes, shit just happens. And life fucks you up. And instead of making people feel like they caused their pain, maybe we should just try being human with each other. 🙏🏽

Focus on you!
07/05/2025, 6:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Most beef burgers are around 550 too.
07/05/2025, 6:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This should be mentioned on the bottle, I think it’s 150 calories or something like that
07/05/2025, 6:58 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Absolutely spot on 💯 
thank you so much !!!
07/05/2025, 7:00 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
07/05/2025, 7:49 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Once we’re done with week 5 (deload week) what do you have to do
07/05/2025, 7:53 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): You can either start a new workout plan which is more intense and has more room for progressive overload or you can follow the same plan you were following before deload, with now increased intensity and progressive overload
07/05/2025, 7:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Where is the new workout plan?
07/05/2025, 8:12 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Which plan were you following?
07/05/2025, 8:12 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: <Media omitted>
07/05/2025, 9:25 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I struggle to reach my target goal of eating 70 g of protein per day! I hardly do it around 40g
Will it affect my weight loss journey?
07/05/2025, 9:27 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: To suppress my stupid eating habits, I have recently started intermittent fasting. Ub Tou bilkul bhi nai khaya ja Raha protein 🤦‍♀️
07/05/2025, 9:27 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Oh!
07/05/2025, 9:27 pm - Taha Ahmed: It won’t stop fat loss directly, but getting too little protein can make you hungrier (and grumpy), less full after meals, and more likely to lose muscle instead of just fat- which can slow your progress and affect your overall body composition
07/05/2025, 9:38 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: @60193244266
07/05/2025, 9:38 pm - PF - Mahan Sanjarani: What medications exactly?
07/05/2025, 9:38 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: @923343773307
07/05/2025, 9:56 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: I have a question around protein intake. Not reaching my targets, but manage to have at least half. I do reach out for artificial related products i.e protein puddings, yogurts. They all fit my macros, but nutritional benefits am i ticking the boxes? 
My folate levels are low- loath taking prescribed medication. What would you recommend eating that would Boost energy,  keep you full but not eat the crap out your calorie bank
07/05/2025, 11:04 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Fruits and vegetables are your best friends. 

Protein will help too (regardless of source)

08/05/2025, 5:17 am - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Which temperature is suitable for workout like can we do it in a ac or a fan ya Phir temperature matter hi nhi krta 
Mene suna hai ke fan off karke karna chahye i dnt know how much real is it or not
@60193244266 
@923343773307
08/05/2025, 9:57 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It doesn’t matter. The temperature makes zero difference to your progress in any way
08/05/2025, 9:57 am - Taha Ahmed: Nope, it doesn’t matter!
I was told that if you work out under a fan, you won’t lose fat because you’re not sweating enough. 😊
But that was in 2009!
Glad we’ve moved past that now!
08/05/2025, 10:00 am - Taha Ahmed: I didn't get what he was trying to tell us. Too many things I guess!!
08/05/2025, 10:03 am - PF - Ali Hassan: Belly fat is stubborn... I think that's the summary 😂
08/05/2025, 10:04 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yeah !! makes zero difference 
Fan ya without fan workout kar k paseena zada aega which many relate to fatloss jisko wajah sy i guess ye myths evolve hoti hain
08/05/2025, 10:05 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Another thing i heard that paseena aata hai zada workout sy n fan ya AC laga ho to body stiff hojati hai hawa lagy to😂
isleay workout with no fans on
08/05/2025, 11:31 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Yes I've heard this one many times 😂
08/05/2025, 12:40 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Exactly the same thing happened with me someone told me that if I’m working out in a room where the fans are off you will sweat more and loose more fat
08/05/2025, 12:41 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Thank you 🤞
08/05/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Means Sirf mene hi nhi suna yet myths 😂😂
08/05/2025, 12:42 pm - PF - Mouttar Ismail: Thank you coaches
08/05/2025, 1:49 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: I also heard this one
08/05/2025, 2:48 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: @923441183411
08/05/2025, 2:51 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): In the workouts sheet uploaded in the FB group you will find different workouts from which you can pick 
also you can follow the same workout for upto 12 weeks with progressive overload its planned that way
08/05/2025, 2:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: U mean to say currently im following the 4 day_ Gym (Week 1-5) 
I can start again with week 1 increasing the weight?
08/05/2025, 2:56 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Or I can choose another plan that is maybe 5day_Gym?
08/05/2025, 3:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes. This is ideal since it allows you to keep a track of your lifts, weights, intensity, volume, etc. <This message was edited>
08/05/2025, 3:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: This is how you ensure you're applying progressive overload and are progressing. If you keep changing plans every few weeks, there'll be no data to suggest whether you're improving or making progress or not.

Hope it makes sense! <This message was edited>
08/05/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Yes!!
08/05/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Thank you so much
08/05/2025, 3:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: Also, should I share my 4-5 week progress to know if im doing everything alright?
08/05/2025, 3:13 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes you definitely can
09/05/2025, 1:21 pm - Taha Ahmed: How's everyone holding up, given the weird, shitty circumstances and this unprovoked war we're in?

But, yes. Pak media is not showing anything. Things were critical on the LOC Raat Bhar. And there is news of more drones so far.

But Indian media was crazy last night. So much fake and drama news. But mostly people (int.) didn't bother that.

14/05/2025, 7:11 pm - C - Hafsa Zulfiqar: When you start being in deficit or eating less than what you usually do - your body wonders whats going on and some sort of mild hunger pangs should be normal right? Esp before sleeping I mean we are so used to eating before sleeping that empty stomach feels uneasy. Not to the point of extreme hunger but just light hunger phase that can pass?
14/05/2025, 7:16 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: <Media omitted>
Calories ?
14/05/2025, 7:24 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): yes hunger pangs in a deficit are absolutely normal 
What you can do is that if u feel hungry at night then plan your more calories n meals for later part of the day or save some for before sleeping
14/05/2025, 7:25 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): lava cake ?

16/05/2025, 1:59 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey everyone,
I have a question. Is it okay to have a protein shake or protein rich food when the stomach is a bit upset? 

In days mai protein ko kaisay complete kerain?
16/05/2025, 2:00 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Ideally yes. But if you don’t feel like eating, then it’s not a big issue.
16/05/2025, 2:06 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I hope for a week or more it doesn't have an issue that one has not hit the protein target in this situation ?
16/05/2025, 2:09 am - Taha Ahmed: If you're not well, or your stomach's not well. No matter what you eat, the food won't stay in the GI much longer, hence smaller/lesser absorption

The aim should be to get better first <This message was edited>
16/05/2025, 2:17 am - PF - Asma Tariq: GI is fine, absorption is okay.  Im just having pain.

Actually I was caught with severe flu and a sore throat. Due to its dose, I'm having stomach aches may be. That's why I'm avoiding any processed food and protein shake.
16/05/2025, 2:18 am - Taha Ahmed: Yeah it's better to avoid anything heavy for the stomach to process 

Take it easy

Have more yogurt, rice, etc. easier to digest too
16/05/2025, 2:22 am - PF - Asma Tariq: 👍

Thank you! 🙂
18/05/2025, 12:15 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hello,
Please recommend a protein  flavour and brand, Jo bht zayda sweet na ho.

And a creatine flavour and brand too.
18/05/2025, 12:17 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think rule1 isn’t too sweet
18/05/2025, 12:18 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Does eating without  proper timings causes bloating etc issues
Meal gaps are important
18/05/2025, 12:18 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Wanted to confrm
18/05/2025, 12:18 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Too much sweet. Chocolate fudge flavour I do have.
18/05/2025, 12:18 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Not necessarily
18/05/2025, 12:19 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I have mocha lol

18/05/2025, 12:20 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Something other than chocolate, cookies flavour. Something settled in taste.

Is the label correct? We can trust it?
18/05/2025, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah but it’s not milk.
18/05/2025, 9:51 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s a tea whitener

18/05/2025, 9:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: What does the ingredients say
18/05/2025, 9:54 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: It's not mentioned anywhere on the pack that it's tea whitener.
18/05/2025, 9:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: How can we differentiate that it's milk or tea whitener if specification is not mentioned on the pack?
18/05/2025, 10:48 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then it’s probably milk.
18/05/2025, 11:08 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I didn't get you. 👀

18/05/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hello coaches i wanted to share one thing with you all 
I’ve had PCOS since 14 years and honestly Ive never had a very good lifestyle and diet so my periods have been very irregular and with improper flow and stuff 


i got my hormonal tests and ultrasound for PCOS done in Feb and it wasn’t a good one! I had many cysts and hormones were quite deranged
but after Eid i have been properly following a good lifestyle (diet, workout program & steps) 
and i have never been so consistent all my life!! 

so yes i took hormonal medicines for 1 month too but apart from that i think it’s safe to say that a big role goes to my lifestyle as well 

and this time my reports came back great Alhumdulilah, the ultra sound showed no cysts and the doctor was shocked too

Alhumdullilah! Thank you so much for your constant support and help! 🥰
18/05/2025, 11:35 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: What did you do ?
18/05/2025, 11:36 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Wow ❤️ 
Keep it up! 🌸
18/05/2025, 11:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is amazing. 

Super happy to hear this.
19/05/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: Honestly i did a couple of good things, tried my best to improve in all aspects 
so my focus was to stay in the caloric range i was suggested my @923343773307 and to eat 110 g of protein each day while also incorporating at least 15g fiber every day
i was following the 4 day workout plan given by the coaches and from tomorrow InshaAllah my week 6 will start and i was also walking every day trying my best to achieve 8k steps (some days I couldn’t but i did still walk even if it was 5k steps only)
19/05/2025, 12:00 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you so much !!🥰
19/05/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you so much @60193244266 , means a lot

19/05/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Anayah Farooqui: You were eating everything but in  calorie deficit  and focusing on protein goal right
19/05/2025, 12:01 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: thank you so much coach taha, means a lot 🥰 can’t wait to reach all my goals soon IA!!

19/05/2025, 12:04 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: I have actually made a post on fb about it, waiting for when @923343773307 can answer that 😅🤭
19/05/2025, 12:05 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: When did you make the post? I just answered a few and didn’t see it.

19/05/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: After
19/05/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Tayyaba Fatima: After workout is better
19/05/2025, 2:50 pm - Taha Ahmed: Two things mainly matter here:

1. Did you eat protein before your workout?- If yes (like a meal or snack within 1-2 hours), you’re totally fine to have your shake anytime after.
2. If you trained fasted (no meal before), then having protein soon after your workout can be helpful for recovery.

At the end of the day though, what matters most is that you’re hitting your total daily protein target, not exactly when you drink your shake.

20/05/2025, 1:00 am - PF - Hamna Haqqi: Hello hello, I have a couple of questions.

For context, you guys had said my calorie intake should be between 1400/1450, but I just started tracking at around 1200ish calories a day initially.

So when I increased my calories from 1200/1300 calories a day to 1400/1450 calories, my scale has gone back to what it was. I don’t feel hungry at night as I did earlier, but my weight is also pretty much the same. Where the weight had gone down 2kgs, it’s now back.


I do feel that my bloating has reduced a bit, and some clothes that felt a bit tighter feel slightly better, but I’m finding it exhausting to track the calories 🥲🥲

I was already not a very junk food/cold drinks consuming person, but I’m a little confused as to what I should be doing and not doing.

Also with my work being a bit intense, I haven’t worked out at all yet, only increased my steps per day. <This message was edited>
20/05/2025, 1:00 am - Taha Ahmed: Hi Hamna, can you post this on Facebook? I'd like to give a detailed response to it

20/05/2025, 2:17 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: I think I'm doing something wrong. I haven't lost a single pound 🤔
How can I know what's the problem 
I've been tracking my calories very carefully, 1500 per day but no exercise and very few steps
20/05/2025, 2:17 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Earlier when I joined this program I lost 3 kgs in a month
20/05/2025, 2:18 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: It's been 15 days since I'm tracking carefully 
I need guidance
20/05/2025, 2:19 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Why glucophage  is given to pcos patience ?
20/05/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Sabina Saeed: It helps in weight regulation
20/05/2025, 2:20 pm - PF - Sabina Saeed: Some doctors support this but some prefer counseling on lifestyle modifications
20/05/2025, 2:21 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ok
20/05/2025, 2:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Likely because of activity levels. If you’re not active then maybe you’re not in a deficit.
20/05/2025, 2:31 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Should I create more deficit then?
20/05/2025, 2:34 pm - Taha Ahmed: Make a post on Facebook and I'll help you figure this out for you 🙏🏽
20/05/2025, 2:36 pm - Taha Ahmed: It's metformin, usually given to type 2 diabetes patients, and is used to aid in improving insulin sensitivity 

The major issue for PCOS/diabetics is insulin resistance, and this med helps with it 

** *It's NOT a weight regulation medicine*
20/05/2025, 2:37 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohkayy means glucophage  is metformin? <This message was edited>
20/05/2025, 2:38 pm - Taha Ahmed: Metformin HCL is its chemical composition
20/05/2025, 2:38 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Inositol  helps on regulation of cycle and all ?
It's a supplement right
20/05/2025, 2:38 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Ohkay now I understood
20/05/2025, 2:39 pm - Taha Ahmed: They both improve insulin sensitivity by regulating blood sugar effectively
20/05/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Okay
20/05/2025, 2:40 pm - PF - Sabina Saeed: Yeah no It is not but it is used for weight regulation in some insulin resistant cases it’s basically an anti diabetic drug but when prescribed to a non diabetic pcos patient it’s *function* is to regulate weight management and insulin resistance which in turn helps with PCOS
20/05/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Does pcos pcod happens only to those had weight gain?
20/05/2025, 2:41 pm - PF - Anayah Farooqui: Or lean people also get this disease
20/05/2025, 2:41 pm - Taha Ahmed: Please post these questions on Facebook 🙏🏽

21/05/2025, 12:10 pm - Taha Ahmed: Okay, I had to dig up this study- and there’s absolutely no mention of nighttime protein supplementation improving recovery. Yes, it gets digested and absorbed fully, but it does otherwise as well if you drink it during the day.

First off, they used casein, which is a slow-digesting protein, and they measured muscle protein synthesis (MPS) - a process where the body converts proteins > amino acids > protein peptides. This is important for recovery or muscle growth but isn’t even a direct marker to measure recovery or growth (esp. if there's not enough protein in the body)

All they really did was compare consuming protein vs not consuming anything at all. And obviously, when you consume protein, it signals MPS to activate. That’s just basic physiology.

What we do know is that total daily protein intake matters way more than when or what type of protein you consume. Also, casein is expensive and not better than whey, so I'd not suggest going for it. 

So the study was about something completely different (from 2012), but these guys running the page spun it into something else entirely. Lol. Classic clickbait! <This message was edited>

I made this Peri Peri chicken, whole chicken with skin. Added 4tbsp of oil in the marinade. Due to the chicken skin, it also released its fats. Seems a lot now.how much oil should I log with 450gms of chicken breast

21/05/2025, 10:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If you added 4tbsp then you add that.
21/05/2025, 10:34 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh you only had 450g. 

How much was the whole chicken in weight?
21/05/2025, 10:36 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: Whole chicken was 1200g
I added 4tbsp oil in 1200g of chicken <This message was edited>
21/05/2025, 10:38 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): around 1.5tbsp for 450g
21/05/2025, 11:20 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Then 450/1200=0.375 

4x0.375=1.5 

You’ll add 1.5tbsp.
21/05/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: That's really helpful 🙂
21/05/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Rahima Shahid: What about the oil that chicken released itself? Do we need to count that or not?
22/05/2025, 12:01 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. That’s account for in the chicken ki calories.

22/05/2025, 12:00 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: When the weight is too much in seated calf raises, can I do each leg separately?
22/05/2025, 12:01 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I am doing 20 kgs each leg so can’t hold 40 kgs together
22/05/2025, 12:02 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can do separately but if u cant do 40 for both legs then just drop the weight when doing both together
22/05/2025, 12:02 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: I can do 40 for both but the problem is the weight is kinda hurting on the knees
22/05/2025, 12:02 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: it’s a kettlebell
22/05/2025, 12:03 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: and plus I can’t pick both up at the same time

22/05/2025, 12:08 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): if u have a standing calf raise machine n the seated one is kind of an issue the knee hurts or whatever is the issue then u can do standing on both days itna masla nahi

Drop the names of foods you love eating but can’t read or understand the nutrition labels for.
For example, K&Ns, biscuits, crisps, etc. If you got pictures, that's even better. :)

I’ll pick a few and break them down in a video I’ll share with the community later today!

24/05/2025, 1:02 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Depends on your starting point and how much weight you have to lose
24/05/2025, 1:13 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Hey,

@60193244266 <This message was edited>
24/05/2025, 1:15 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): I'm using Kevin Levrone's Gold Creatine in Sour Watermelon flavour n i honestly like the flavour 
I have heard good reviews about Kaged Creatine flavours too
24/05/2025, 1:21 am - PF - Asma Tariq: <Media omitted>
What's this HCI or monohydrate? If you can let me know?
Very good flavours btw. 
And in its benefits, strength, muscles recovery etc mentioned.

About cognitive benefits , it's not mentioned there. 👀
24/05/2025, 1:26 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Monohydrate is always the preferred one
HCL is like abit better with solubility & those having some gastrointestinal issues can opt for HCL 
else monohydrate is a goto
24/05/2025, 1:28 am - PF - Asma Tariq: In its benefits, cognitive help is not mentioned. 
It just bothered me to ask you this.
24/05/2025, 1:29 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): creatine helps with cognitive functions
24/05/2025, 1:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I don’t you flavoured creatine. Never have lol
24/05/2025, 1:34 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I add it to whey daily
24/05/2025, 1:35 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Which one do you use? <This message was edited>
24/05/2025, 1:47 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: MyProtein or Rule1
24/05/2025, 1:48 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Last used some local Chinese brand too
24/05/2025, 1:57 am - PF - Asma Tariq: That sachet tasters?.
24/05/2025, 2:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: No no. Basically 99% of the creatine in the world comes from China
24/05/2025, 2:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: So I just ordered directly from their factories hahaha
24/05/2025, 2:35 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Half price than most brands

😂
25/05/2025, 2:43 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Well on a serious note.
The first impression is very Catchy. 
👍 From my side.
25/05/2025, 3:01 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Great website-Taha and Sameet your transformation are both amazing. Only feedback from me is expanding your USP as you offer so much more then other marketed programs do. The headed titles you have have especially “community coaching” could be expanded on what that entails. You guys are epic on the ways your answering those questions promptly on the wattsapp groups. Love the 3 different choices of programs you have, but  the middle one seems so much more attractive then the expensive one does. 
Love it that you offer a 1-1 consultation too and so so much more. Live testimonials would be an added bonus. 
Well done guys ❤️
25/05/2025, 4:31 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: The expensive one is the middle one but for 2 months. 

I think that’s what you’re referring to.
25/05/2025, 4:35 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Exactly. Someone who looks at it as a scroller would miss that the 2 month deal so much more better. Love it that the website is real and not plastic. An app would be fabulous along side the other platforms too x
25/05/2025, 4:43 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Love the website! The transformation pics are amazing, and I'm so glad I joined your WhatsApp community - it's the best!

25/05/2025, 5:39 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: But, it's not clearly mentioned that it's  for two months. Or might be I missed something.

25/05/2025, 5:48 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Now it's there. 
When I first viewed it, I couldn't see the 2 months. 

It's a refreshing website. Btw. Very good work. ❤️
25/05/2025, 5:50 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
Can you make the white background of the text box go away? Maybe fill in with a color. I think it will make the text more prominent too
25/05/2025, 5:50 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: May be the same as base.
25/05/2025, 5:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I was just about to ask where's my brother's handsome mug with the molten cake 😂
25/05/2025, 5:56 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: It's there now
25/05/2025, 5:58 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Is the tired of the endless diet cycle line meant to be repeated twice? 🤔
25/05/2025, 6:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: <Media omitted>
25/05/2025, 6:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I was thinking of shifting that line as a standalone above the are you sick of heading and remove the repeated one below? <This message was edited>
25/05/2025, 6:10 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hello, ill look up the website and definitely give an honest feedback✨
25/05/2025, 6:11 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i have a question
25/05/2025, 6:11 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: or I would say another silly question 🤪
25/05/2025, 6:13 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: if there are two people having different body weight, and obviously different body fat %, and both wanna master a skill let’s say for example handstand 

will the person with low body weight and body fat % able to master the skill first or it’s all about practice, focus and strength of an individual?
25/05/2025, 6:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Not necessarily... this is not how it works.
Just because someone has lower body fat or weighs less doesn’t automatically mean they’ll be better at handstands or master it faster.

A guy with 8% body fat might look lean, but if he hasn’t trained for strength, balance, or coordination, he might struggle. Meanwhile, someone with 30% body fat who’s been lifting for years, building core strength, shoulder stability, and proprioception… might kick up into a solid handstand without breaking a sweat.

Body fat % doesn’t tell you much about functional strength or motor control.
25/05/2025, 6:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: Yes, sure, lower body weight can sometimes make certain things mechanically easier, but if you lack the foundation- strength, control, practice, etc., it won’t matter!
25/05/2025, 6:16 pm - Taha Ahmed: So nah, don’t get caught up in numbers. If I was starting, Id focus on what actually builds the skill.
25/05/2025, 6:18 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: okay thank you so much coach
25/05/2025, 6:43 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: <Media omitted>
This button is not working for me in mobile view
25/05/2025, 6:49 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Same. But I think it's still work in progress maybe. Btw *42* tabs? 👀 🙈

Inn shortcuts say bahir ajayain warna bohat jald weight stuck kay saath saath aur serious issues hojayain gay.

26/05/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I don’t know why I am sharing this with you all but today was one of the most intense and life defining days I’ve ever lived.

Just a few days ago, I received official notice from my university, my final PhD research proposal defense and presentation before the Advanced Research Board was scheduled for Monday, May 26th at 10:50 AM. It was the day I had been preparing and working toward for years.

Last night, while I was reviewing my notes and slides, life took a sharp turn. My beloved grandmother suddenly began struggling to breathe. We rushed her to the hospital, but she didn’t make it. She passed away, leaving behind not only us but also her daughter with Down syndrome, who depended entirely on her.

Grief hit hard. I was torn between responsibilities toward my family and toward my academic career journey. After heartfelt discussions, we decided to hold the funeral at 11:00 AM to allow time for family flying in from abroad.

Somehow, I found the strength to give my grandmother ghusal, perform her final rites, and say my silent goodbyes before walking away from the janaza to fulfill a duty I had worked so hard for.

I reached the university just in time while her Janaza was still in our home. With trembling hands and a heavy heart, I stood before the Vice Chancellor and board members and presented my defense. And by some unknown strength, maybe even her blessings, I cleared it. Right there, on the spot.

Life can be ruthless in its timing. I don’t know what I felt more in that moment grief, triumph, numbness, or an unfamiliar kind of courage. All I know is, I faced two of the most defining events of my life in a single day.

Sometimes, we don’t realize the strength we carry until life gives us no choice but to find it.

This is life, sudden, unpredictable, and unbelievably complex. 🙃
26/05/2025, 10:16 pm - PF - Ali Hassan: We are your fomo family that's why ❤️ some losses are hard even after time passes we feel the void hope you get through this

Congratulations. This the strength and resilience you have built in you. I am proud of you and look upto you. May Allah Bless you alot more success Ameen
26/05/2025, 10:25 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Thank you for sharing this with us. 

Reading about your day reminds me of how strong humans can be and how at times, we forget that. 

Thank you for being that reminder. 

Also, you’re freaking doctor now that’s amazing. Congratulations. 

You might not feel like celebrating that win abhi and that’s understandable. But when you do, we’ll all be waiting for a pizza party.
26/05/2025, 10:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: And if you need anything in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out

I’m officially a PhD scholar now! I defended my research proposal, which is one of the crucial, biggest and most important milestones in this whole journey. I got the date and appointment of this board after 7 months of hard work.  

Still have to complete my thesis and publish my research before I can officially be called Doctor but this step feels huge.

When that day finally comes, pizza party for everyone. 🙃
26/05/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: Rabbi yassir wala tu'assir wa tam-mim bil khair,  In Sha Allah everything goes well for you ❤️

27/05/2025, 12:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: I couldn't respond last night because I really don’t even know how to put this into words without sounding like a TED Talk, but… damn. What a day. What a story. What a woman.

Thank you for letting us into this moment. Not just the strength of it... but the raw, impossible timing of it all. The kind of day life throws at you when it’s clearly bored and wants to see if you’re secretly made of steel. (Plot twist: You are.)

Losing someone and showing up for something you’ve built your entire self around- in the same breath- is not just brave. It’s sacred. I hope you find the time and space to grieve on your own terms. No pressure to be okay, no timeline, no hustle. Just… breath. And maybe some biryani and cake if your soul asks for it.

Take care of you- not just the new PhD you, but the grieving, exhausted, somehow-still-smiling you. And if you feel like collapsing, collapsing into this community is a good start. We’ve got you! (if you can't already tell! 👀)

And, congratulations. Also... just realizing why trauma and academic excellence pair so well?!!!!

Sending you prayers, strength, and quiet moments of peace.
(And yes, I’m holding you to that pizza party.)

And my deepest condolences for your loss - losing a grandparent is not easy at all. Hope you heal soon.
27/05/2025, 1:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): i'm so sorry to hear about your loss i can somehow understand and relate to this as i lost my brother recently 

Defending a thesis isnt easy that too Phd ka like my MS defence wasnt easy n then defending it in such circumstances requires alot of composure strength and character. 

Hats off to you !!
Take your time to process & then give yourself a big treat on this achievement
27/05/2025, 3:14 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: @923441183411  So sorry for your loss. 
The process of grief and  composing your self within life events are hurdles that only “warriors” can do. You both are exactly that. 
Both of your scenarios are very relatable to myself as i gave birth to my Son on the same day as my mother leaving this world. 
To say that inner strength that you pull out is life changing. ❤️
27/05/2025, 3:27 pm - PF - Sumera Adnan: So Sorry for your loss, May Allah grant him highest place in Jannah.
27/05/2025, 3:52 pm - PF - Areesha Khan: Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un. May Allah grant your grandmother the highest place in Jannah.

28/05/2025, 1:55 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Thank you, Taha. (:
I'm still somewhere in between so many strange feelings sad, shocked, overwhelmed... honestly, pata nahi.

We spent our whole lives with our Daddi Maa through every thick and thin moment. She was 97, and was doing fine.

But I guess this is how it was meant to be. This is life, isn’t it? 🙃
28/05/2025, 1:56 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: 💯
28/05/2025, 1:58 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I can truly understand.

29/05/2025, 4:39 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: @923343773307 Like weekly average calories, can we follow the same rule for protein? Focusing on good protein over the week instead of per day? Some days, I can't eat much protein.
29/05/2025, 4:52 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope. Unfortunately protein doesn’t work like that. 

Your body doesn’t have the ability to store Protein and so because of that you have a daily protein requirement.
29/05/2025, 5:03 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: Sucks 🙁
29/05/2025, 5:17 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: Got the gym buzz now ( so far every day)! 
Little problem , my body is now feeling the “ouch” factor. 
1) whats good to take before and after a workout to help body recovery. 
2) should i split the different elements- e.g legs one day and arms the next or need to stop being a wuss and push through
29/05/2025, 5:18 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s normal to feel sore in the beginning. It usually lasts for 1-2 weeks. 

The two biggest things that can help with recovery are protein and sleep. Focus on those 💪🏼
29/05/2025, 6:59 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yeah as sameet said its normal to feel sore for this first 2 weeks but if your overall nutrition n protein intake is good u r sleeping enough then u wont be feeling sore after the initial weeks as much 
and for the split, if you are following one of the programs uploaded in the group then u r just fine all the program are well structured
31/05/2025, 1:48 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Project FoMo learning doesn't just stop with yourself. It truly provides you the ability of positively impact the lives of your loved ones!

Guys if I had half of this Mediterranean omelette and 1 piece of the bread, do I break the omelette down into egg oil tomato feta? Or just an omelette
31/05/2025, 5:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’ll be more accurate if you break it down. It’s usually 3 eggs.
31/05/2025, 6:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: 1.5 egg, 2-3 tsp oil plus half a toast
31/05/2025, 6:00 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: Could this work? 🤔
31/05/2025, 6:00 pm - PF - Hamna Haqqi: There was feta inside too, but not sure how much! So must add that I guess
31/05/2025, 6:00 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Add some 20g of feta too.

2) I’m super hungry- Worried i’m gonna go above my allowance. 
3) strength V’s Cardio- i am doing 25 min on the treadmill inclined and then going for strength exercise’s. If i was to focus on just strength/weights, would i see results more physically.

04/06/2025, 8:08 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: Hi Haris, my first one was fine - felt like nothing. I took my second last night and I woke up with a lot of heart burn and stomach cramping (which may or may not also have to do with the fact that I ate channa ki daal and naan for dinner before the shot) so I'm just trying to hydrate a lot today and not eat till I'm feeling better.

Do you people have studied any published research  about relationships with food or fitness and OB?
11/06/2025, 2:45 am - PF - Asma Tariq: or any related one?
11/06/2025, 2:45 am - PF - Asma Tariq: OB - Organizational Behavior

11/06/2025, 2:55 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: I’m not sure what you mean. Can you elaborate a bit more
11/06/2025, 3:17 am - PF - Asma Tariq: I'm talking about the linkage between nutrition and behavior. 

Two separate fields but have strong links. A research can be done on it. Nutrition and performance/well-being etc etc. what's you say? A link can be created?.

I'm thinking like a researcher. Lols. Bohat ideas arahay hain mujhy.
11/06/2025, 3:22 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: A million researches exist on nutrition and behavior and nutrition and performance too. 

All of this is interlinked.
11/06/2025, 3:29 am - PF - Asma Tariq: Now I got the point.

I was basically talking bout "workplace nutrition" or "knowledge about nutrition" and "Behavior at workplace" or "performance at workplace".

11/06/2025, 3:42 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): There are different ways to implement progressive overload. Let me give you a few 

1. Increase Weight
 If you can do all your reps easily add a little more weight next time.  
Example: If you did 3 sets of 12-15 reps with 50lbs, try 55lbs in the next workout

2. Increase Reps
If you can’t add weight yet, do more reps with the same weight.  
Example: If you did 3x10 with 50lbs, try 3x11-12 next time.

3. Do Both Over Time
Once you hit the top of your rep range (e.g., 12 reps), increase the weight and drop reps slightly.  
Example: If you did 3x12 with 50lbs, go up to 55lbs and aim for like 3x8 .

Keep making small increments in weights  
Stay with in 6-15 rep range & keep progressing 
Rest enough between sets 2-3minutes or even more if you need <This message was edited>

11/06/2025, 4:22 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: And how many warm sets should we do before working set? And what should be the rep range and weight for it? And for each muscle group should we do a seperate warm set?
11/06/2025, 4:30 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): perform 2-3 warmup sets for 6-8 reps or 4-6 reps short of failure at like 50-70% of your working set weight for the first exercise & 1-2 sets in a similar way for the second exercise 
You will be good to perform working sets directly for all the other exercises but if you want to perform a warmup set for all the exercises you can but isnt necessary

Hello Coaches, needed guidance, yesterday was my first day, i managed to do the day 1 workout of the 5days gym and todays workout has all leg excercises so should i just skip to day 3 plan?

11/06/2025, 7:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If your issue is knee based then you can likely still do leg curls and RDL type movements. Calf work should be fine too
11/06/2025, 7:35 pm - PF - Eman Ali: Hi, I want to start but I havent had a finalising feedback yet so umm how long? <This message was edited>
11/06/2025, 7:38 pm - PF - Samia Najam: hi i'm new here and i want to start my weight loss journey
11/06/2025, 7:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: I think @923343773307 replied to your post last night. 

If there’s a comment he has to get back to then I’m guessing he will tonight.
11/06/2025, 7:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Please go through the starter guide. @923343773307 must have tagged you in a post already
11/06/2025, 7:39 pm - PF - Eman Ali: Yes he did, but nothing finalising. Ok sure thanks
11/06/2025, 7:42 pm - PF - Samia Najam: not yet
11/06/2025, 7:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hi, I responded and gave you a few cues to ponder over and reassess what you really want to do, so go over my responses again once and if weight loss is what you want then we'll work around that. I'll respond to it later at night!
11/06/2025, 7:44 pm - Taha Ahmed: @923356063768 I don't think you've joined the Facebook community yet
11/06/2025, 8:07 pm - PF - Samia Najam: yeah em not a fb user
11/06/2025, 8:15 pm - PF - Eman Ali: Yea I did respond. Yes I want to lose weight I mean thats the goal.
11/06/2025, 8:15 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You’ll need to create a Facebook account to access the community.
11/06/2025, 8:17 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Thanks for responding what is the alternate for leg curls, my gym doesnt have any leg movement equipment atm.
11/06/2025, 8:18 pm - PF - Samia Najam: ok i'm doing it
11/06/2025, 8:21 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Also should i go on lighter weights for reference i got this injury in feb while doing basic leg raises a minor tear and I thought it was a muscle pull and i kept working out and made it worse for myself unknowingly so im a little skeptical ive been doing the excercises the phsio has recommended daily but the doctor has told me this will take time to improve and repair and pain to settle

-apologies for such a long post
11/06/2025, 8:44 pm - PF - Subhan Amir: Hey,
For the bench press, should our elbows stay close to the body at a 45-degree angle, or is it better to keep them straight out to the sides?
11/06/2025, 9:02 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i created a fb account and requested your community . please check it out
11/06/2025, 9:57 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It does take time. What’s the underlying issue?
11/06/2025, 9:58 pm - PF - Eman Ali: Are there foods that improve insulin sensitivity?
11/06/2025, 9:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Both are fine but most people find it more comfortable if it’s a 45 degree angle.
11/06/2025, 9:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Oh then it’s just RDLs
11/06/2025, 9:58 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Vegetables.
11/06/2025, 9:59 pm - PF - Eman Ali: All of them?
11/06/2025, 9:59 pm - PF - Eman Ali: And does using frozen supplies reduce their impact or something?
11/06/2025, 9:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Pretty much
11/06/2025, 9:59 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Nope
11/06/2025, 9:59 pm - PF - Eman Ali: Thanks
11/06/2025, 10:10 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: probably improves it because starch becomes resistant

At least in the case of rice
11/06/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Eman Ali: I meant for vegetables
11/06/2025, 10:14 pm - PF - Eman Ali: But thankyou
11/06/2025, 10:25 pm - PF - Subhan Amir: Alright! Thankyou. Was tucking them in at the gym when someone tried to give me some unsolicited advice so thought I should ask😁
11/06/2025, 11:09 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: Until and unless i dont have the kitchen scale, can i not start my journey?? Can i get some pcos friendly workouts to begin with??? Please
11/06/2025, 11:13 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: Dearest FoMo Fam, 🌸

As I take a step forward in my journey, I want to pause and express my deepest gratitude to this amazing community that has been an essential and impactful part of my life since November 2024. 

I joined FoMo as a gift to myself on my 36th birthday, a promise to enter my 40's with strength, health, and clarity. What I found here was so much more than I ever imagined. 🙌 

I came looking for a sustainable, no-nonsense approach to food, weight loss, and wellness, and FoMo became my primary school for nutrition, food education, and self-awareness.

The experience has been truly transformative (especially my mindset about food, health, fitness and nutrition). From learning to build my own calorie deficit plans (yes, even with pizza and biryani, burgers and what's not) to forming a mindful relationship with food, I’ve grown in confidence and clarity. I no longer fall for food myths, nor do I feel guilty when enjoying my favorite meals. That kind of freedom is truly priceless. 💞

The exceptional part of this community is, we’ve shared our emotions, our wins, our lows, and even poured our hearts out here <3 and the coaches and fellow members were always there with encouragement, support, and appreciation. 🤗 Those moments of connection made this space feel like family. ❤️

Special thanks to @60193244266 , @923343773307 , and @923441183411 , your coaching, insights, and energy have left a lasting impact. And to all my community mates (specially my shit posting folks Hehehehe) @966593000250 and @447360154390,  thank you for the support, laughs, check-ins, and shared struggles. You made this journey fun, real, and unforgettable. 🤪 😊

Though I’m stepping away to focus more on strength building and now require more personalized coaching due to my increasing workload, I'm carrying everything I’ve learned from FoMo with me, the habits, the mindset, the nutrition knowledge, and most importantly, the belief that transformation is not just possible, but sustainable and enjoyable. 💞

I will surely miss you all  but yes, I’m moving forward for my better cause.

This is not a goodbye. It’s a “see you around,” with a stronger, clearer version of me, one that this community helped shape. ❤️


Heheheheh, bohat formal ho gaya na :p but it's an emotional moment and I will miss this community. (:

Thanks again Sameet, Taha, Ali and FoMo Fam. 🫶
If I can help anyone in any way, don't hesitate to reach out. 🙏

With love and deep gratitude, ❤️ 
Asma Tariq
11/06/2025, 11:27 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: A minor muscle tear
11/06/2025, 11:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can. You can start improving your nutrition. 

Also, there’s no such thing as a PCOS friendly workout. PCOS isn’t a physical disability and you don’t need to adjust workouts around it. 

Workouts that can be done by someone with no PCOS, can also be done by someone with PCOS.
11/06/2025, 11:28 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Can I make one last request? Please post this in the fb group too 🤣🤣🤣🫣
11/06/2025, 11:29 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. Then maybe just skip the lower body workouts till you have the go ahead from your physio. And till then focus more on upper body.
11/06/2025, 11:29 pm - PF - Asma Tariq: I already did 🤪

Aap ka approval chahye wahan bs :p <This message was edited>
11/06/2025, 11:29 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: I have heard that women with pcos should not do high intensity workoutss🥲 it would increase cortisol
11/06/2025, 11:30 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: So i should keep alternating the upperbody workout accordingly right?
11/06/2025, 11:31 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): Yeah you can do the upper body as per the plan
11/06/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Felicia Carlton: Thank you ☺️
11/06/2025, 11:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s not true. In fact, there’s research that HiiT is more beneficial in PCOS. 

But we’re not a massive fan of HiiT. The workout we share are strength based not HiiT.
11/06/2025, 11:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. For now. Till your legs better.
11/06/2025, 11:58 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: Allrightt, can you guide me regarding the workouts ??
11/06/2025, 11:59 pm - PF - Javeria Umer: I dont have a kitchen scale yet with me sadly

12/06/2025, 12:04 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): you can start with prioritizing protein & focusing on eating more whole foods, eating enough fiber veggies fruits & drinking enough water 
Eat mindfully & you can share meal pics in the calorie tracking group we will guide you how to lof the foods until u get yourself a scale
12/06/2025, 12:07 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): workouts are uploaded in the FB group both gym n home workout options available
You can pick from that sheet a workout plan of choice depending how many days you will be working out & if you want to do a home or gym workout
12/06/2025, 2:21 am - Taha Ahmed: Can you tell me what's the name of the profile? There are 6 requests today and I can't see your name

12/06/2025, 4:10 am - PF - Yasir Taqi: Noooooo 😜 always a pleasure to see fellow members getting the most out of FoMo and transforming themselves not just physically but mentally as well. For sure enjoyed our banter here esp the shitposting 😁😁 I wish you the very best for the upcoming journey and here's to a stronger you 💪🏼💪🏼

12/06/2025, 7:10 pm - PF - Mahnoor Nadim: I’m also digging the new group name because I need the accountability. I haven’t been tracking at all. Workout se to jaisay allergy ho. I’m overworked and stuck in a cycle of both mental and physical exhaustion. No amount of sleep is enough. Eating better and moving more would help with that I know nahi karti phir bhi 🥲 <This message was edited>

13/06/2025, 11:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: I had such a long day today and didn't even want to move. But I still went to the gym and did the bare minimum because I didn't have energy. I wanted to stay consistent, so I focused on getting in more steps instead of lifting weights
13/06/2025, 11:29 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: played Padel
Does it count? 😂
13/06/2025, 11:30 pm - Taha Ahmed: 100%
13/06/2025, 11:32 pm - PF - Muhammad Ali: Yesterday I didn’t sleep all night but I went to gym after fajar and did my workout. I thought my performance would not be the same without sleep but it was good enough
13/06/2025, 11:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Absolutely. Movement is movement.
13/06/2025, 11:35 pm - OC - Muhammad Haris: I am enjoying Padel a lot but still try to get workouts in for muscle building and retention
13/06/2025, 11:37 pm - PF - Samia Najam: Now when everyone is telling their dedication i must participate ... i joined it just two days back but what a positive energy i've got . i'm not going to any gym but i'm focusing on how to be active all day just by improving some of my habits ... I followed the exercise chart given by the coaches and lifted weight for the first time 😅 ... the only issue i am facing right now is my disturbed sleeping hours ...
13/06/2025, 11:39 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s a massive win btw and definitely something to be proud off. 

What’s your total sleep time?
13/06/2025, 11:39 pm - PF - Samia Najam: its 6 hours hardly
13/06/2025, 11:40 pm - PF - Samia Najam: its not because of the routine or something ... i just can't sleep more than this
13/06/2025, 11:41 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Try to slowly add more sleep. You might need to force yourself initially. 

I used to be like that but can do get minimum 7 hours easily.
13/06/2025, 11:41 pm - PF - Samia Najam: i'm working on it ..
14/06/2025, 12:34 am - PF - Areesha Khan: Asalam Alikum I’ve a question coaches 
Does inflammation make it difficult for the body to lose weight, and are there certain foods that causes inflammation?
Do rice and roti causes inflammation in body?
14/06/2025, 12:55 am - Taha Ahmed: I'd first ask: what's inflammation?
14/06/2025, 1:14 am - PF - Areesha Khan: I am not much awared tbh about this but a friend of mine was saying u are eating rice and roti it causes inflammation you wont lose weight to which I thought I am eating everything and losing weight she is a doctor so I didn’t argue  😂
14/06/2025, 1:15 am - Taha Ahmed: Sameet would never have abs if eating rice and roti was causing inflammation 😅
14/06/2025, 1:16 am - PF - Areesha Khan: 😂😂😂😂
14/06/2025, 1:19 am - Taha Ahmed: I don't think even your friend knows what 'inflammation' actually is. lol!

So I'd like to educate everyone here. There are two kinds of inflammation.
1. Acute (the good kind), which helps your body heal from injury or fight infection, etc.
2. Chronic, low-grade inflammation (this is like a subtle fire in your body), and this chronic inflammation is what affects insulin sensitivity, makes it harder for yoru body to absorb nturients etc.
14/06/2025, 1:19 am - PF - Areesha Khan: and one more thing she said females have inflammation 😂
14/06/2025, 1:20 am - Taha Ahmed: Now, what foods actually contribute to chronic inflammation for most people? We're typically looking at highly processed foods, excessive added sugars, unhealthy trans fats, and large amounts of refined carbohydrates (like white bread, sugary drinks, deep-fried snacks). These are the main culprits, but only if that's the only thing you eat everyday, every week, and every month
14/06/2025, 1:21 am - Taha Ahmed: Rice and roti, by themselves, do NOT inherently cause inflammation for the vast majority of people. They are carbohydrate sources that provide energy. Unless you have a specific intolerance (like celiac disease for wheat/roti), or lactose intolerance where you can't have dairy. These foods are perfectly healthy when eaten as part of a balanced diet and within your overall calorie goals.
14/06/2025, 1:21 am - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): The irony is boht zada doctors consider themselves nutritionists dietitians when they are not actually & unko 4-5 saal ma entry level nutrition max parhaya jata hoga us sy zada kuch nahi
14/06/2025, 1:21 am - PF - Areesha Khan: i’ll screenshot this and keep it me
14/06/2025, 1:23 am - Taha Ahmed: The major issue with us and our people is that our diet is consisted of processed foods and we lead the most sedentary lifestyle in the world. We barely exercise, or move around. We eat more than we need. We rarely take care of our mental and emotional health, have the poorest sleep routine and barely get 4-5 hours at night, etc., and yet we're quick to blame certain food because it causes 'inflammation'
14/06/2025, 1:24 am - Taha Ahmed: This mindset and the stress of eating 'healthy and unhealthy' probably causes more stress and inflammation than these foods!
14/06/2025, 1:27 am - PF - Samia Najam: i also wanna ask something ... is metabolic rate same in every person or it varies ?? cause my sister eating everything believe me everyyy single thing is super skinny and fit mashaAllah ... but my case is totally different i walk exercise eat and still i use to take a good care of my diet because of my bulky body <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:31 am - Taha Ahmed: What you're observing between you and your sister is very real! The short answer is, yes, metabolic rate definitely varies from person to person. While genetics play a role in our BMR -what your body burns at rest, the biggest difference often comes from Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) 

Your sister might naturally have a higher NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)- she might just fidget more, walk faster, or move around subconsciously throughout the day without even realizing it, burning more calories

Plus what someone perceives as 'eating everything' might not actually be consistently eating a higher calorie intake over a week. They may eat a lot one day and eat much fewer calories over the next few days, resulting in a moderate overall calorie intake - which is why she's able to maintain her weight 

YOUR body has its unique needs and responses, so focusing on what works for your body with consistent effort is exactly the right approach here. <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:32 am - PF - Samia Najam: thanks
14/06/2025, 1:35 am - Taha Ahmed: To give you a clearer example, Sameet, Ali, and I could potentially all weigh 80kg and eat the exact same 2000 calories and protein on a given day. But if Sameet is consistently moving more, working out regularly, and generally being highly active, he might lose weight. Ali, on the other hand, might have an activity level that perfectly matches his 2000 calories, allowing him to maintain his weight. Meanwhile, if I'm eating the same 2000 calories but not moving as much, I might actually gain weight

I hope this helps!!
14/06/2025, 1:36 am - Taha Ahmed: Now, imagine we all meet and see Sameet eating 5000 calories in a day. That's all we see or perceive, yet he still ends up losing weight. We might think he's got a fast metabolism, but in fact, he just didn't eat enough over the next few days, which likely allowed him to create a deficit and lose weight <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:37 am - PF - Samia Najam: yeah i got it ... as she can't sit straight a minute ...
14/06/2025, 1:38 am - Taha Ahmed: There we go!
14/06/2025, 1:38 am - PF - Samia Najam: okay so like this deficit works for week rights ?
14/06/2025, 1:38 am - PF - Samia Najam: as i'm considering it as a daily dose for my body
14/06/2025, 1:39 am - Taha Ahmed: Yes, so when we're trying to lose weight, it's better to focus on weekly averages instead of daily. You don't make or break anything in a day. It takes weeks and months! :) <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:39 am - PF - Samia Najam: like if i ate nothing for one or two days and the next day i ate alot of calories so it didn't effect me deficit right ?
14/06/2025, 1:39 am - PF - Samia Najam: thats so relaxing hearing it .... i just can't tell you how helpful you people are ❤️
14/06/2025, 1:41 am - PF - Samia Najam: i am taking 1700 calories everyday so instead of counting in on days i better start it with 11,900 calories a week ? is this a right approach ? <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:42 am - Taha Ahmed: If your weekly total calorie intake is 14000 kcal (2000 per day):

You could eat a 1000 kcal each day for 5 days, which accumulates to 5,000 kcal. This leaves you with 9,000 kcal for the remaining 2 days. 

This means you could have two days where you feast like The Rock and still remain within your total weekly calorie target! <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:43 am - Taha Ahmed: You're right!
This works better, for normal people like you and me and everyone else here <This message was edited>
14/06/2025, 1:43 am - Taha Ahmed: As long as you're within your calorie limits over a period of a week. YOU'RE GOOOOOD!!!!
14/06/2025, 1:44 am - PF - Samia Najam: you have solved a biggest problem for me ... cause i can't eat for the whole day but i only feel to eat at late hours ... ok you mean its ok
14/06/2025, 1:45 am - Taha Ahmed: Oh and this is just one strategy. It may work for some and may not work for others.
But there are hundreds of ways this can be done.

Do what works for you, your body, and your soul. lol!
14/06/2025, 1:45 am - PF - Samia Najam: yeah i've started counting my calories after watching sameet's videos ... and now after joing this it all becomes more clear to me
14/06/2025, 1:46 am - Taha Ahmed: Ensure you're eating enough protein and are within your calorie limits; then, you can just eat two big meals at night and still lose weight. 😊
14/06/2025, 1:52 am - Taha Ahmed: I have already said enough so one last thing and then I'm off to bed;

You'd still track your calories a day, but WON'T LOSE YOUR SHIT if you end up eating a little more on one of the days. You can adjust it the next day or over the next few days.

As long as you're in your weekly ________ limit, you're good! Lol 
(fill in the blanks yourself to know if you understood!)
14/06/2025, 1:54 am - PF - Samia Najam: deficit

17/06/2025, 3:06 am - PF - Zainab Adil: Hello 

Two questions: 
1. Thoughts on calorie banking? Is it worth it or does it risk creating a binge and restrict cycle? 
2. ⁠Any advice on managing nutrition and training during various stages of the menstrual cycle? Given that cravings are highest and training is poor in the luteal phase. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
17/06/2025, 3:07 am - Taha Ahmed: Can you post it in the Facebook group? I'd give a detailed response to it

17/06/2025, 11:22 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Scalw i havw atarted hating
17/06/2025, 11:22 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: Clothes size changed from largw to medium.that also on a dheeeela side
17/06/2025, 11:22 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: But scale playa betwwen juat change in 1 to 2 kg max in 2 mnths
17/06/2025, 11:23 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: That’s BECAUSE you started working out.

So you’re building muscle too now and this is why the scale won’t be as effective a metric currently. 

THIS IS WHY YOU DON’T FOCUS ON ONE METRIC and look at the bigger picture.
17/06/2025, 11:23 pm - PF - Mina Rizvi: So trust measurwments
17/06/2025, 11:23 pm - PF - Hina Faizan: Same problem! 😏 
But I think thats because of the muscle gain 🤔 <This message was edited>
17/06/2025, 11:24 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Answer a question for me. 

If you woke up tomorrow and had your dream body (whoever you think has the ideal physique) but you stood on a scale and it said a number that you didn’t expect. 

Would you care? Should you care?
17/06/2025, 11:25 pm - Taha Ahmed: Nope. As long as I have my physique, I'm good. It will probably be at 100kg or something though! 🤣😅 <This message was edited>
17/06/2025, 11:26 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah. If I look like CBUM, I’m going to throw all the scales out 😂😂😂

17/06/2025, 11:28 pm - Coach - Syed Ali Qasim (FoMo): As long as i'm looking good with a decently muscular physique who cares about the scale !!
17/06/2025, 11:30 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly. It’s a tool to track progress. We use it for that. That’s it.

take baby steps 

read the guides , terms and conditions (sent in your inbox over insta )
calculate your macros and post your introduction on fb

it takes time to adjust, learn and adapt, dont step back 
it's alright to feel this way

21/06/2025, 4:03 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can still share photos now. Not an issue. 

I’m more interested in why you think things went wonky?
21/06/2025, 4:07 am - PF - Hareem Sumbul Bhatti: Macros were wonky because kabaarr khaa liya (crisps and Cheetos) and calories went above what was required in an attempt to hit protein goals. Also I don’t have access to a gym here. At home I have my equipment at least.

Worked 10 hours in the office to catch up on a hectic week today. Sacrificed time with my babies to be at the gym #KickAssReset
21/06/2025, 10:22 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I just fueled up and am headed to the gym myself. Let's gooo 😁
21/06/2025, 10:27 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yup. That’s all you really need to do. 

Don’t focus on WhatsApp messages of other. Those aren’t meant for you. 

Share your progress, your nutrition and focus on that. That’s it.
21/06/2025, 10:42 pm - Taha Ahmed: What Sameet said above. 

Focus on the guides and things only the coaches have shared. That's all you need. 

The rest of it is just a bonus. If you have time, energy, and capacity for it, then follow it, otherwise no need.
21/06/2025, 10:43 pm - Taha Ahmed: Sometimes we all gotta trade off for something else. That's just how life is! Kudos to you for doing this!! 🙌🏽

Just got back from leg day and my legs are crying- but in the best way

Slowly getting back to the shape I was in last vear (before I got sick!!!)

The last few days were hectic - setting UP RESET for everyone else, making sure all systems were running smoothly. 

I didn't get a chance to share much about my own journey.

But starting tomorrow, I'm back.
Back to sharing. Back to tracking,
Back to burning (fat, not out 👀) haha!! 🤣

I'm aiming to lose 8kg of fat in the next 58 days- not just to get leaner, but to feel stronger, lighter, happier.
Thick and thriving 😒 yup!

Posting it here to keep myself accountable and hoping this would encourage everyone to get started properly.

LET'S Gooooooooo!!

This is essential for seeing your incredible results and for RESET prize eligibility!

Don't skip this step!!

24/06/2025, 6:08 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: What if we’re in it just for the reset and not the prize. Do we still take photos ? Or measurements and startinng weight enough ?
24/06/2025, 6:09 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: I started the 4-day gym plan yesterday. Felt really good getting back to the gym after a break. Today I'm excited for day 2 and I'm glad I don't feel too much  DOMS. 💪🏼

 I have already weighed myself on day 2 of RESET. All that remains is to take measurements (wanted to take them in the morning same time when I check my weight) and my initial picture to monitor progress.

 Nutrition is on track and I feel more energetic already alhumdullilah.

Excited to transform alongside you @923343773307 💪🏼💪🏼🙌🏼

24/06/2025, 6:14 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Also how to get those steps up? I manage about 5000 on my treadmill in the morning, but now by 6pm i’m only at 8k. I’ll do 10k but i’m pretty sure i should be able to get much more in.
24/06/2025, 6:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: 10k is a lot in a country like Pakistan that’s not meant for walking.
24/06/2025, 6:33 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But I get most of my steps inside the house. Like right now replying on the group and I’m pacing around my house.

Found this gem for you all! 
Must watch!! As some of you who have just started their journey might not be seeing results on the scale. This will help look beyond the scale too.

My left shoulder's been acting up for 4 weeks now, so I haven't been able to do any push or overhead movement. But I still go to the gym almost every day to get my steps in. So, I've been very consistent with my movement.
My weight's still 90.3 or something!

Now that I've been consistent with RESET protocols for a week, the game begins! 8kg fat loss in 7 weeks! 
Who thinks I can do it, again?? <This message was edited>

27/06/2025, 3:12 pm - PF - Yasir Taqi: You've got this!! You're gonna start seeing results soon 💪🏼 

Today is supposed to be my day off but since I started later in the week (my week starts from Sat) I need to finish day 4. At least the gym won't be too crowded today 😁

The consistency I'm trying to build has started to show on my scale 🥳 will be sharing the collective change at the 30 day mark In Sha Allah 😁
27/06/2025, 9:13 pm - PF - Sabrina Malik: <Media omitted>
Feel like shit, but pushing myself. I’ve increased my lifting weight , downed my sets and upped my reps from 10 to 15. Feeling the burn 🔥

A quick update!! 🫡
I was all set to go to the gym... stepped out, saw the rain, and immediately turned back. Karachi rain just ruins everything man. Hate it when it rains... Anyway.

Didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to do anything.
But I still showed up - did my steps on my roof...in the rain, and hit my daily goal.

Some days aren’t heroic.
You just drag yourself through it anyway.

That’s what matters.

1) you hit your protein target
2) you worked out 3 times this week 
3) you slept 7-8 hours 

Give yourself credit where credit is due- high five 🖐️
28/06/2025, 12:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: Exactly.
28/06/2025, 12:11 am - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s one day. Rest it out. Maybe your body is tired or maybe it’s fighting something like an infection / viral that you don’t know of.

28/06/2025, 4:52 am - PF - Atiya Fahad: I try my best to hit at least 8k every day 
mostly I do hit 7 k but some days it’s just like 4-5 k

There is definitely a difference between then and now in the same clothes. Yet my weight is pretty much the same and measurements also. So how is that possible?
29/06/2025, 9:41 am - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: Even some shirts which i had kept aside bcz they were tight, they are still a bit tight but fit much better than before..
29/06/2025, 12:17 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: This is what we call body composition. 

This is what most people NEED to focus on but don’t. We’re too caught up with scale weight.
29/06/2025, 12:19 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: VID-20250629-WA0005.mp4 (file attached)
This.
29/06/2025, 12:22 pm - PF - Alina Alam: This is true but how does one focus on building muscle while on a calorie deficit. in my experience it’s very hard to maintain protein macros while being in a deficit.
29/06/2025, 12:24 pm - PF - Alina Alam: so i’ve decided to get to my desired weight window first and then focus heavily on protein to build muscle
29/06/2025, 12:24 pm - PF - Alina Alam: also prioritize protein while losing the weight but it’s hard
29/06/2025, 12:30 pm - PF - Mehrnaz Khan: But measurements are also same more or less tho they are not done consistently at the gym
29/06/2025, 12:35 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: It’s not that hard if you’re able to adjust your food choices. 

And obviously, to build muscle you also need to consistently lift weights and get stronger in the gym.
29/06/2025, 12:37 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: You can do this but this means there’s a chance you’re going to lose muscle while losing weight. 

So technically you’ll be worse off in terms of muscle.  

Also, you’re prolonging the entire process slightly.
29/06/2025, 12:39 pm - PF - Alina Alam: i lift weights and try and prioritise protein with each meal but I don’t lift beyond 10 kg yet, am i building muscle or not?
29/06/2025, 1:03 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: If it’s more than what you could lift earlier than yes.
29/06/2025, 1:03 pm - PF - Alina Alam: interesting, that makes sense

God knows🥺
but I am sad...
not demotivated but yes I need a shoulder pat and a cheering push for the coming week plsssss🥹🥹🥹

The past two days have been f*ckin weird - no other way to put it.
Almost skipped the gym again today, but after missing two days thanks to Karachi rain, I had to drag myself here.

Decided to keep it simple:
Just lunges.
10 sets x 6-8 reps.
That’s it. That’s the update..

(Some of y’all hate lunges, I get it. But they hit differently, possibly better, when your head’s messy and you just need to move.)

Will be starting a 4 day gym split from today as well

Hopefully will keep myself accountable and will see changes in the upcoming weeks <This message was edited>

He’s covered it well.
01/07/2025, 10:04 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hey FoMo Fam, quick one!

Sameet just dropped a must-watch video in the group- it’s about those sneaky beliefs and inner narratives that limit our growth (aka: cognitive dissonance in action). If you’ve ever felt stuck, second-guessed yourself, or wondered why you keep getting in your own way, this is for you.

Go watch it when you get a sec- it might shift something for you. And I say that as someone who also needed that reminder.

Video is here:👇🏽

02/07/2025, 12:30 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: hello coaches, i feel like my chest muscles & shoulders muscles are not that strong
02/07/2025, 12:31 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: like when it’s time to progressive overload
02/07/2025, 12:31 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: i can increase weights for other exercises
02/07/2025, 12:31 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: but not for the ones that target these muscles groups
02/07/2025, 12:32 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Yeah, that’s normal. Shoulders take time to add load to
02/07/2025, 12:34 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: what about chest?  
like i was doing bench press with 2.5 kg on each side and the bar weight was around 7-8 kg idk 
today i tried increasing the weight to 5 kgs, could do 8-10 reps max
02/07/2025, 1:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: Going from 2.5kg to 5kg is a 100% increase in weight. So yeah, that’s a lot.
02/07/2025, 1:07 pm - Coach - Sameet Khan: But 8-10reps are good enough for now
02/07/2025, 2:06 pm - PF - Atiya Fahad: ok thank you got it 💪🏻
02/07/2025, 2:09 pm - PF - Samia Najam: for unsubscribing i just have to leave the community?
02/07/2025, 2:12 pm - Taha Ahmed: Hi Samia. You don't have to leave on your own. I do housekeeping frequently, and I'll take care of it myself. You enjoy your access to the community till then and make the most of it! 🙏🏽
02/07/2025, 2:25 pm - PF - Samia Najam: sure
